ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
------------+----------

 
We are a technology firm focused on enhancing communications between public companies and their shareholders and investors. We currently have two distinct business units:
 

● | Our unique SaaS platform, Sequire provides users many features which allow issuers to track their shareholders’ behaviors and trends, then use data-driven insights to engage with shareholders across marketing channels. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Through LD Micro, we organize and host investor conferences within the micro and small- cap space, and plan to create several more niche events for the investor community. 

 
Our endeavor provides our clients an integrated investor and shareholder analytics platform drove us to develop this platform, acquire LD Micro, and begin cultivating the Sequire Community. Each SRAX business unit delivers valuable insights that assist our clients with their investor relations and communications initiatives.
 
Sequire
 
In May of 2020 we rebranded our SaaS offering SRAX IR, as Sequire, emphasizing the platform’s strength to secure and acquire investors. The Sequire platform is a central hub where companies reach out and engage with shareholders, manage warrants, and identify potential investors.
 
This powerful software utilizes machine learning and advanced analytics to bring our clients actionable information that we believe can be used to maximize ROI through better investor and stockholder communications. Clients then have the ability to engage with targeted shareholder groups across marketing channels including email, social media, programmatic, and hyperlocal.

When interpreting data, clients can see gains and losses over time, buying/selling trends, total outstanding shares, new shareholders, and shareholders broken out by percentage. Based on this data, we can then build companies a customized communications campaign in which we use targeted ads and crafted messaging to reach the desired outcome for a client.
 
An important part of monitoring shareholders is the greater context of the investment landscape. Sequire features real-time level-two trading data, the ability to monitor competition, news alerts, and more. Additionally, Sequire’s functionality includes a custom survey feature that allows issuers to ask questions to all their shareholders at once or to specified groups.
 
The Sequire platform also allows users to manage warrants, attaining high-level insight by year and month, including a list of expiring and outstanding warrants. They can then calculate what their proceeds could be if those warrants were issued before they expire. Clients can also keep tabs on investor relations programs and corporate communication firms, all in one place.
 
We expanded the functionality of Sequire to include the hosting of virtual events, as more and more networking functions are being held in the digital space. Clients can attend an event held by industry guests or hold a conference themselves. They then have the ability to import contacts from those events directly into their own list for later use and targeting.
 
Virtual Events and LD Micro
 
LD Micro was originally founded in 2006 as an independent resource for the microcap world. It quickly grew into a premier event platform in the space, successfully connecting investors and promoting small cap businesses. In September of 2020, we acquired LD Micro, and hosted the 2020 Main Event on our Sequire Virtual Events platform. We are proud to say we had over 50K attendees and hosted webinars with 250 companies.
 
The LD Micro Main Event is one of the most influential conferences in the small-cap space, and our acquisition has been able to provide LD access to our growing database of 5M+ investors.
 
We are currently expanding our slate of events to include specialty conferences for individual industries such as: EdTech, FinTech, Minerals, Pharma, etc. Our retail investor community of 5M+ investors, and the ability to help educate investors with these events, is valuable to our investor community. Through the events platform, we have the ability to host a variety of virtual events and conferences including investor conferences, earnings calls, shareholder meetings, annual, investor/analyst days, corporate town halls, roadshows, and more. We see the Sequire Virtual Events platform growing into the premier investor event tool. Although the Covid-19 Pandemic certainly created growth in this space, we believe that virtual events are the future of targeted investor communication.
 
We are offering users a seamless, centrally managed virtual events solution that can be customized to any industry. Sequire Virtual Events has already demonstrated success with the LD Micro Main Event, and we will continue to devote resources to the growth of this area of our business.
 
Sequire Community
 
Building a thriving community is often an overlooked aspect of business. With a significant number of investors aware of the LDMicro brand, we are moving to ensure that those people become passionate advocates, engaging with each other on a wide range of topics.
 
We have plans to develop investor education tools, host professional investment events, and cultivate a mature, educated community. Our vision for the Sequire Community is that it becomes a place where people can communicate and network, to learn and grow as investors, and ultimately become brand advocates. 
 
Marketing and sales
 
We market our services through our in-house sales and marketing team. Our team focuses on social media, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, public relations (PR), industry events and the creation of white papers which assist in our marketing efforts and are used as lead generation tools.


Intellectual property
 
We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information.

Government regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve matters central to our business. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. We are also subject to many of the laws that cover the securities industry and are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


These laws may involve privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people’s data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.
 
Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
 
We may become the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into in July 2019 with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which is pending federal court approval and which, among other matters, will require us to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business.
 
Employees
 
As of March 29, 2021, we had 153 full-time employees. We also employ services of certain consultants on an as needed basis. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.
 
Our history
 
We were originally organized in August 2009 as a California limited liability company under the name Social Reality, LLC, and we converted to a Delaware corporation effective January 1, 2012. Social Reality, LLC began business in May 2010. Upon the conversion, we changed our name to Social Reality, Inc. On August 15, 2019 we formally changed our Name to SRAX, Inc. During the second half of 2018, we sold our SRAXmd product line. In September of 2020, we acquired LD Micro as a wholly owned subsidiary. In February of 2021 we completed the divestiture of our BIGToken subsidiary and related product lines.
