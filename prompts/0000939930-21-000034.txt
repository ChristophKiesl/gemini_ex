Item 1. Business
This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report") is being filed by Pyxus International, Inc. (the “Company,” “Pyxus,” “we,” or “us”). The Company is the successor issuer to Old Holdco, Inc. (“Old Pyxus”) and was incorporated as a Virginia corporation in August 2020 to facilitate the Restructuring described below. The terms the “Company,” “Pyxus,” “we,” or “us” when used with respect to periods commencing prior to the effectiveness of the Plan (as defined below), refer to Old Pyxus, unless the context would indicate otherwise. As the context requires, the “Company,” “Pyxus,” “we” and “us” also includes the consolidated subsidiaries of Pyxus International, Inc.
On June 15, 2020 (the "Petition Date"), Old Pyxus (then named Pyxus International, Inc.) and its then subsidiaries Alliance One International, LLC, Alliance One North America, LLC, Alliance One Specialty Products, LLC and GSP Properties, LLC (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) to implement a prepackaged Chapter 11 plan of reorganization to effectuate a financial restructuring (the “Restructuring”) of Old Pyxus’ secured debt. On August 21, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Amended Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”) filed by the Debtors in the Chapter 11 Cases. On August 24, 2020, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms, and the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. In connection with the satisfaction of the conditions to effectiveness as set forth in the Confirmation Order and the Plan, Old Pyxus completed a series of transactions pursuant to which the business assets and operations of Old Pyxus were vested in a new Virginia corporation, Pyxus Holdings, Inc., which is an indirect subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the Confirmation Order and the Plan, at the effectiveness of the Plan, all outstanding shares of common stock, and rights to acquire the common stock, of Old Pyxus were cancelled and the shares of common stock of the Company were delivered to certain creditors of Old Pyxus. Other than our Chief Executive Officer, our Board of Directors does not include any of the individuals who served as directors of Old Pyxus at the time the Chapter 11 Cases were commenced or at the effectiveness of the Plan. These and other related matters are discussed in greater detail in "Note 3. Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11" to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements," which is incorporated herein by reference. Cross references included in this Annual Report to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” are to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.
Company Overview
Pyxus provides responsibly produced, independently verified, and traceable agricultural products, ingredients and services to businesses and customers. Headquartered in the Research Triangle Park region of North Carolina, we contract with growers across five continents to help them produce sustainable, compliant crops. 
Historically, Pyxus’ core business has been as a tobacco leaf merchant, purchasing, processing, packing, storing and shipping tobacco to manufacturers of cigarettes and other consumer tobacco products throughout the world. Through our predecessor companies, we have a long operating history in the leaf tobacco industry with some customer relationships beginning in the early 1900s. Our core leaf tobacco operations continued to account for almost all of our revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
We are committed to responsible crop production that supports economic viability for the grower, provides a safe working atmosphere for those involved in crop production and minimizes negative environmental impact. Our agronomists maintain frequent contact with growers prior to and during the growing and curing seasons to provide technical assistance to improve the quality and yield of the crop. Throughout the entire production process, from seed through processing and final shipment, our SENTRISM traceability system provides clear visibility into how products are produced throughout the supply chain, supporting product integrity.
In an increasing number of markets, we also provide agronomy expertise for growing leaf tobacco. Our contracted tobacco grower base often produces a significant volume of non-tobacco crop utilizing the agronomic assistance that our team provides. Pyxus is working to find markets for these crops as part of our ongoing efforts to improve farmer livelihoods and the communities in which they live. 
Beginning in 2017, we undertook a strategic process designed to diversify the Company's products and services by leveraging our core strengths in agronomy and traceability. In general, our diversification strategy focused on products that were value-added, required some degree of processing and offered a higher margin potential than our core tobacco leaf business. In support of this strategy, the Company made the following investments: 
4 


E-liquids
•On April 2, 2018, we purchased a 51% interest in Humble Juice, LLC ("Humble Juice"), a manufacturer and distributor of flavored e-liquids. Humble Juice is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.
•On August 21, 2017, the Company completed a purchase of a 40% interest in Nicotine River, LLC ("Nicotine River"), a manufacturer, retailer and wholesale supplier of compounds used for e-liquid production, and on August 14, 2020, the Company exchanged its 40.0% ownership interest in Nicotine River for an additional 14.3% interest in Humble Juice, increasing the Company's ownership interest in Humble to 65.3%. 
Industrial hemp/CBD
•On December 18, 2017, a subsidiary of the Company completed a purchase of a 40% interest in Criticality LLC ("Criticality"), a North Carolina-based industrial hemp company to engage in cannabidiol ("CBD") extraction and other applications for industrial hemp. On April 22, 2020, that subsidiary completed a purchase of the 60% interest in Criticality not owned by the subsidiary, and as a result Criticality became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pyxus. 
Legal cannabis in Canada
•On January 25, 2018, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of the Company acquired a 75% equity position in Canada’s Island Garden Inc. (“Figr East”). Figr East is fully licensed to produce and sell medicinal and adult-use cannabis in most of the provinces in the Canadian market. We acquired an additional 18% and 1.2% equity interest in Figr East on March 22, 2019 and October 15, 2019, respectively, increasing the ownership percentage to 94.2%. 
•On January 29, 2018, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of the Company acquired an 80% equity position in Figr Norfolk Inc. ("Figr Norfolk" and, together with Figr East "Figr"), formerly known as Goldleaf Pharm Inc., which is fully licensed to produce and sell medicinal and adult-use cannabis in most of the provinces in the Canadian market. 
Following the effectiveness of the Plan and the election of additional members of our Board of Directors in October 2020, our Board of Directors determined to exit the industrial hemp, CBD and Canadian cannabis businesses in light of the Company’s limited capital resources and the continuing capital requirements to develop and expand these early-stage businesses. In December 2020, the Company commenced actions to exit operations of the industrial hemp businesses, including the production and sale of products containing extracts of industrial hemp, including CBD products, by Criticality. Criticality’s CBD extraction facility has ceased operations.
On January 21, 2021, Figr Norfolk Inc. (“Figr Norfolk”) and Figr Brands, Inc. (“Figr Brands”), which are indirect subsidiaries of the Company, and Canada’s Island Garden Inc. (“Figr East,” and together with Figr Norfolk and Figr Brands, the “Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries”), which, prior to its sale on June 28, 2021 was an indirect subsidiary of the Company, applied for relief from their respective creditors pursuant to Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the “CCAA”) in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (the “Canadian Court”) in Ontario, Canada as Court File No. CV-21-00655373-00CL (the “CCAA Proceeding”). On January 21, 2021 (the “Order Date”), upon application by the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, the Canadian Court issued an order for creditor protection of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries pursuant to the provisions of the CCAA and the appointment of FTI Consulting Canada Inc. to serve as the Canadian Court-appointed monitor of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries during the pendency of the CCAA Proceeding (the “Monitor”). On January 29, 2021, the Canadian Court issued an order permitting the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries to initiate a sale and investment solicitation process to be conducted by the Monitor and its affiliate to solicit interest in, and opportunities for, a sale of, or investment in, all or substantially all, or one or more components, of the assets and/or the business operations of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. The Canadian Court also approved a debtor-in-possession financing facility (the "Canadian DIP Facility") provided to Figr Brands by another non-U.S. subsidiary of Pyxus (the "DIP Lender") in an initial amount of up to Cdn.$8.0 million, which following approval by the Canadian Court was increased to Cdn.$16.0 million, to fund the working capital needs of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. 
On May 10, 2021, a definitive agreement for the sale of the assets of Figr Norfolk was entered into for an estimated purchase price of Cdn.$5.0 million. On June 10, 2021, the Canadian Court approved the sale agreement. The consummation of the sale under this agreement is subject to approval of the buyers by Health Canada and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. 
On May 25, 2021, a definitive agreement was entered into with a separate buyer for the sale of the outstanding equity of Figr East and certain intangible assets of Figr Brands for an estimated aggregate purchase price of Cdn.$24.8 million. On June 10, 2021, the Canadian Court approved the sale agreement. On June 25, 2021, Health Canada approved the buyers of Figr East and certain intangible assets of Figr Brands. The consummation of the sale of Figr East and certain intangible assets of Figr Brands occurred on June 28, 2021. 
The amount of recovery that the Company may receive from the sale of the assets of Figr Norfolk, the sale of the outstanding equity of Figr East, and the sale of certain intangible assets of Figr Brands will be impacted by the amount of claims against the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries submitted in the CCAA Proceeding, the extent to which such claims are approved by the 
5 


Canadian Court, and the extent to which the Company's interest in the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries are determined by the Canadian Court to be debt claims entitled to recovery on the same basis as other unsecured creditor claims with respect to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. These and other related matters are discussed in greater detail in “Note 5. CCAA Proceeding and Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries” and “Note 30. Subsequent Events” to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.
As of March 31, 2021, we owned a 50% noncontrolling interest in Purilum, LLC ("Purilum"), a U.S. company that develops, produces, and sells consumable e-liquids and e-liquid components to manufacturers and distributors of vapable products. During the periods reported in the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the results of Purilum, and for periods during which we owned a non-controlling interest in Criticality and Nicotine River, the respective results of those businesses, are not consolidated in our financial results reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and we accounted for our respective interests in these businesses during those periods under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our interest in their financial results for those periods, along with our interests in the financial results of several unconsolidated joint ventures with leaf tobacco operations, are reflected as “Income from unconsolidated affiliates, net” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result of the commencement of the CCAA Proceeding and the appointment of the Monitor, and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries have been deconsolidated from the Company’s financial statements as of the Order Date.
As a result of the deconsolidation of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, as of March 31, 2021, our consolidated operations are managed and reported in nine operating segments that are organized by product category and geographic area and aggregated into three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Leaf - North America, Leaf - Other Regions, and Other Products and Services. The Other Products and Services segment includes Global Specialty Products ("GSP") - E-liquids, GSP - Hemp, GSP - Other, and Value-Added Agriculture Products. The Other Products and Services segment included, for periods prior to the Order Date, the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, which comprised an operating segment within the reportable segment.
Leaf Tobacco Operations
Our leaf tobacco revenues are primarily comprised of sales of processed leaf tobacco and fees charged for processing and related services to these manufacturers of tobacco products. Processing and other revenues are approximately 5% of our total revenues. Our leaf tobacco operations deal primarily in flue-cured, burley, and oriental tobaccos that are used in international brand cigarettes. Leaf tobacco revenues are primarily comprised of sales of processed tobacco and fees charged for processing and related services to these manufacturers of tobacco products. 
We purchase tobacco in more than 32 countries and ship to approximately 90 countries. We primarily purchase tobacco directly from suppliers. In those instances, we assume the risk of matching the quantities and grades required by our customers to the entire crop we must purchase under contract. 
Our arrangements with suppliers vary depending on our predictions of future supply and demand, local historical practice and availability of capital. In some locales, we purchase seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and other products related to growing tobacco, which represent prepaid inventory, and issue them to suppliers with whom we have purchase contracts. The suppliers then utilize these inputs to grow tobacco, which we are contractually obligated to purchase. The advances of inputs for the current crop generally include the original cost of the inputs plus a mark-up and interest as it is earned. Where contractually permitted, we charge interest to the suppliers during the period the current crop advance is outstanding. We generally advance inputs at a price greater than our cost, which results in a mark-up on the inputs. We account for our advances to tobacco suppliers using a cost accumulation model, which results in us reporting our advances at the lower of cost or recoverable amounts excluding the mark-up and interest. The mark-up and interest on our advances are recognized when the tobacco is delivered as a decrease in our cost of the current crop. Upon delivery of tobacco, part of the purchase price paid to the supplier is paid in cash and part through a reduction of the advance balance. The advances applied to the delivery are reclassified out of advances and into unprocessed inventory. We advance inputs only to suppliers with whom we have purchase contracts. Under longer-term arrangements with suppliers, we may advance or guarantee financing on suppliers' capital assets, which are also recovered through the delivery of tobacco to us by our suppliers.
Our agronomists maintain frequent contact with suppliers prior to and during the growing and curing seasons to provide technical assistance to improve the quality and yield of the crop. As a result of various factors including weather, not all suppliers are able to settle the entire amount of advances through delivery of tobacco in a given crop year. Throughout the crop cycle, we monitor events that may impact the suppliers’ ability to deliver tobacco. If we determine we will not be able to recover the original cost of the advances with deliveries of the current crop, or future crop deliveries, the unit cost of tobacco actually received is increased when unrecoverable costs are within a normal range which is based on our historical results or expensed immediately when they are above a normal range based on our historical results. We account for the unrecoverable costs in this manner to ensure only costs within a normal range are capitalized in inventory and costs that are above a normal range are expensed immediately as current period charges.

We process tobacco to meet each customer's specifications as to quality, yield, chemistry, particle size, moisture content, and other characteristics. Unprocessed tobacco is a semi-perishable commodity. The processing of leaf tobacco facilitates shipping and prevents spoilage and is an essential service to our customers because the quality of processed leaf tobacco substantially affects the quality of the manufacturer’s end product. Accordingly, we have located our production facilities in proximity to our principal sources of tobacco. We process tobacco in Company-owned and third-party facilities around the world, including Argentina, Brazil, China, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Macedonia, Malawi, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, United States, and Zimbabwe. These facilities encompass all leading export locations of flue-cured, burley, and oriental tobaccos. After processing, whole leaves, bundles, strips or stems and scrap where applicable are separately packed in cases, bales, cartons or hogsheads for storage and shipment. Packed flue-cured, burley and oriental tobacco generally is transported in the country of origin by truck or rail, and exports are moved by ship. 
During the seven months ended March 31, 2021, the five months ended August 31, 2020, and the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 16%, 13%, 15%, and 17%, respectively, of our purchases of leaf tobacco were from the Leaf - North America operating segment and approximately 84%, 87%, 85%, and 83%, respectively, were from the Leaf - Other Regions operating segment. Within the Leaf - Other Regions operating segment, approximately 60%, 68%, 67%, and 67% of our total purchases for the seven months ended March 31, 2021, five months ended August 31, 2020, and the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were from Brazil, China, Turkey, and the Africa Region. We have entered into contracts, joint ventures and other arrangements for the purchase of tobacco grown in substantially all other countries that produce export-quality flue-cured and burley tobacco.
Key Customers
In our leaf tobacco business, our primary customers are major consumer tobacco product manufacturers. Refer to “Note 29. Segment Information” to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information regarding customers, and their respective affiliates, that account for more than 10% of our annual revenues. Pyxus delivered approximately 35% and 41% of its tobacco sales to customers in Europe and approximately 16% and 13% to customers in the United States for the seven months ended March 31, 2021 and the five months ended August 31, 2020, respectively. The remaining sales of leaf tobacco are to customers located in Asia, Africa, and other geographic regions of the world.
Competition
The leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive and competition is based primarily on the price charged for products and services as well as the merchant's ability to meet customer specifications in the buying, processing, residue compliance and financing of tobacco. The Company is one of only two global, publicly held leaf tobacco merchants. We hold a leading position in most major tobacco growing regions in the world, including the principal export markets for flue-cured, burley and oriental tobacco. In addition to the primary global independent leaf tobacco merchants, there are a number of other independent global, regional or national competitors. Local independent leaf merchants with low fixed costs and overhead also supply cigarette manufacturers. In many areas, total leaf tobacco processing capacity exceeds demand.
Seasonality
The purchasing and processing activities of our leaf tobacco business are seasonal. Tobacco purchases vary by market and tobacco variety. Flue-cured tobacco grown in the North America is purchased, processed, and marketed generally during the five-month period beginning in July and ending in November. North American burley tobacco is purchased, processed, and marketed usually from late November through January or February. Tobacco grown in South America is usually purchased, processed, and marketed from January through July and in Africa from April through September. Other tobacco markets around the world have similar purchasing periods, although at different times of the year. During the purchasing, processing and marketing seasons, inventories of unprocessed tobacco, inventories of redried tobacco, and trade accounts receivable normally reach peak levels in succession. Current liabilities, particularly advances from customers, and short-term notes payable to banks, normally reach their peak in this period as a means of financing the seasonal expansion of current assets. At March 31, the end of our fiscal year, the seasonal components of our working capital reflect primarily the operations related to foreign-grown tobacco.
Track and Trace Technology
In connection with its leaf tobacco operations, the Company uses a proprietary “track and trace” system, which we have branded as the SENTRISM platform, which we believe provides transparency into the lifecycle of agricultural products by monitoring information and obtaining data related to the growth, cultivation, harvest, processing, formulation, testing, and release of individual batches of products. By obtaining data on products at each stage of the supply chain, SENTRISM permits proactive decision-making for both the Company and its leaf tobacco customers. The key features of the SENTRISM platform include:
•Product Tracking: Data collection and tracking at various stages in the product lifecycle permits customers and consumers to gain an understanding of where products originate from, how they were produced, and the product testing data in order to understand ingredients and the product journey. 
7 


•Control and Visibility: With access to increased data regarding the supply chain, we are able to monitor quality control at various points in the product route to market.
•Sustainability Commitments: SENTRISM incorporates visibility into the practices and procedures of the product supply chain.
•Lot Number Tracking: We are able to track specific products through the manufacturing process by lot number with full visibility to our customers. This permits us and our customers to discover more about the product, its origin and other information relevant to quality control and product transparency.
•Agronomic Services: SENTRISM utilizes an experienced team of agronomists to track data and insights regarding growing practices.
Regulation
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of applicable government regulation of leaf tobacco.
E-liquids
The Company conducts an e-liquids business primarily through its majority-owned, consolidated subsidiary, Humble Juice, and an investment in Purilum, an unconsolidated joint venture. Humble Juice sells branded, flavored e-liquids (that is, the liquid containing tobacco-derived nicotine used in vaporizers, electronic cigarettes, and other vaping hardware and accessories) to retailers for sale to consumers and directly to consumers. Humble Juice has historically offered consumers flavored e-liquid products under the Humble Juice Co. brand name through its website. Humble Juice operates out of a facility in Thousand Oaks, California. 
Purilum offers flavor formulation and development for vaping products, including e-liquids. In addition to creating original flavors for manufacturers, Purilum replicates formulations and flavors, matching brand requirements. In addition, Purilum develops and manufactures vaping products, including vapable oils and nicotine salts, for sale to consumers through retailers, as well as for business-to-business commerce.
Competition
The market for the e-liquid products is highly competitive and subject to rapid change and regulatory requirements. While historically the e-liquids niche of the vaping industry had low barriers to entry, recent regulatory requirements in the U.S. have created regulatory hurdles and authorizations for new entrants to those markets. The e-liquids market is highly fragmented, and many of the competitors of each of Humble Juice and Purilum have significantly greater resources than it does. Each of Humble Juice and Purilum competes primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising, and price.
Regulation
The FDA has authority to regulate e-liquids, e-cigarettes and other vaping products that contain (or are used to consume e-liquid containing) tobacco-derived ingredients (e.g., nicotine) as "tobacco products" under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act"), as amended by Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the "Tobacco Control Act"). Via the issuance of the "Deeming Regulation" that became effective on August 8, 2016, the FDA began regulating e-liquids, e-cigarettes, and other vaping products that qualify as "tobacco products" under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act's requirements added by the Tobacco Control Act. The Deeming Regulations extended the FDA's "tobacco products" authorities to apply to most previously unregulated products that meet the statutory definition of "tobacco product," including e-liquids, e-cigarettes and other vaping products that contain (or are used to consume e-liquid containing) tobacco-derived ingredients ("Deemed Tobacco Products"). Beginning August 8, 2016, Deemed Tobacco Products became subject to all existing statutory controls initially applicable only to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco (including components, parts, and accessories of such products) as well as some existing and some new FDA regulations related to the sale and distribution of tobacco products. As a result, Deemed Tobacco Products are now subject to various federal restrictions and requirements, including without limitation: 
•a prohibition on sales to those younger than 21 years of age and requirements for verification by means of photographic identification by purchasers under 27 (which we anticipate the FDA will increase to 30 via regulatory amendment); 
•requirements to include addictiveness warnings on product packages and in advertisements; 
•a ban on vending machine sales unless the vending machines are located in a facility where the retailer ensures that individuals under 18 years of age (which we anticipate the FDA will increase to 21 via regulatory amendment) are prohibited from entering at any time, provided the facility's operator otherwise complies with the prohibition on sales to consumers younger than 21; 
•requirements for owners and operators of domestic tobacco product manufacturing establishments to register their establishments with the FDA and submit listings of products manufactured at those establishments to the FDA;
•requirements for submission of health documents, ingredient listings, and listings of the quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents in products and their emissions;
8 


•a prohibition on marketing of "new tobacco products" (i.e., products not commercially marketed in the United States "as of" February 15, 2007, or modified in any physical respect since) without prior FDA authorization;
•a prohibition on making direct and implied claims of reduced risk such as through the use of "light", "low" and "mild" descriptors unless the FDA confirms (a) that scientific evidence supports the claim and (b) that marketing the product will benefit public health; and
•a ban on the distribution of free samples.
The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that any Deemed Tobacco Product that was not commercially marketed as of the "grandfathering" date of February 15, 2007 obtain premarket authorization before it can be marketed in the United States. However, the FDA has announced a compliance policy for such Deemed Tobacco Products that qualify as "new tobacco products" under which the agency will not enforce these requirements for non-finished products (i.e., those intended solely for use in future manufacturing), which include certain products manufactured by Purilum. As modified by orders issued by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the current compliance policy also generally allows companies to market finished Deemed Tobacco Products that qualify as "new tobacco products" but that were on the U.S. market on August 8, 2016, until September 9, 2020, and the continued marketing of such products without otherwise-required authorization for up to one year during the FDA's review of a pending marketing application submitted by September 9, 2020. The current compliance policy does not apply to flavored, cartridge-based e-liquid products, other than tobacco- or menthol-flavored products, which the Company does not market directly. The current compliance policy also does not apply to otherwise-eligible products (i) for which the manufacturer has failed to take (or is failing to take) adequate measures to prevent minors’ access and (ii) that are targeted to minors or with marketing that is likely to promote use by minors. In the absence of this policy, Humble Juice and Purilum would have had to obtain prior authorization from the FDA to market these products after August 8, 2016. Accordingly, such finished e-liquid products have been marketed pursuant to the FDA's current compliance policy based on evidence that they were on the U.S. market on August 8, 2016, and have not been physically modified since.
FDA authorization to introduce a "new tobacco product" (or to continue marketing a "new tobacco product" covered by the current compliance policy for Deemed Tobacco Products that were on the U.S. market on August 8, 2016) could be obtained via any of the following three authorization pathways: (1) submission of a premarket tobacco product application ("PMTA") and receipt of a marketing authorization order; (2) submission of a substantial equivalence report and receipt of a substantial equivalence order; or (3) submission of a request for an exemption from substantial equivalence requirements and receipt of a substantial equivalence exemption determination. The Company cannot predict if the finished, nicotine-containing e-liquid products of Humble Juice and Purilum, all of which would be considered "new tobacco products," will receive the required marketing authorization from the FDA if they were to seek premarket approval through an available authorization pathway. 
Since there were few, if any, e-liquid, e-cigarette or other vaping products on the market as of February 15, 2007, there is no way to utilize the less onerous substantial equivalence or substantial equivalence exemption pathways that traditional tobacco corporations can utilize for cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and other traditional tobacco products. In order to obtain marketing authorizations, manufacturers of practically all e-liquid, e-cigarette or other vaping products would have to use the PMTA pathway, which could potentially cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars per application. Furthermore, the Deeming Regulations created a significant barrier to entry for any new e-liquid, e-cigarette or other vaping product seeking to enter the market after August 8, 2016, since any such product would require an FDA marketing authorization through one of the aforementioned pathways. Humble Juice filed PMTAs for its line of finished Deemed New Tobacco Products by the September 9, 2020 deadline. These PMTAs are pending with the FDA.
Provisions included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, the omnibus appropriations and COVID-19 stimulus bill enacted on December 27, 2020 (the “2021 Appropriations Act”), require the United States Postal Service (the “USPS”) to issue regulations prohibiting the mailing of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, as well as nicotine e-liquids products. On February 19, 2021, the USPS published its proposed regulations (the “Proposed Regulations”). The Proposed Regulations would subject e-cigarettes, vaping devices products, and e-liquid products to all existing restrictions on and exceptions for the mailing of cigarettes, except that the existing exceptions permitting the mailing of cigarettes (i) for consumer testing purposes and (ii) by federal agencies for public health purposes would not be available for the mailing of e-cigarettes, vaping devices products, and e-liquid products. If the Proposed Regulations were enacted as proposed by the USPS, subject to limited exceptions in applicable USPS regulations (including between legally operating businesses pursuant to applications approved by the USPS), shipment of these products via the USPS, including shipments to consumers, would be prohibited on and after the date on which the USPS promulgates the final regulations.
Provisions of the 2021 Appropriations Act subject e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, as well as e-liquids products, to the provisions of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009 (the “PACT Act”), which imposes stringent rules on online sellers. Under the PACT Act, online retailers are required to (i) register with the U.S. Attorney General, (ii) verify the age of customers using a commercially available database, (iii) use private shipping services that collect an adult signature at the point of delivery, (iv) if selling in states that tax vaping products, register with the federal government and with the tobacco tax administrators of the states, (v) collect all applicable local and state taxes, and affix any required tax stamps to the products 
9 


sold, (vi) send each taxing state’s tax administrator a list of all transactions with customers in their state, including the names and addresses of each customer sold to, and the quantities and type of each product sold and (vii) maintain records for five years of any delivery interrupted because the carrier or delivery service determines or has reason to believe that the person ordering the delivery is in violation of the PACT Act. Sellers who do not register or do not comply with the shipping and reporting rules of the PACT Act are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including up to three years in prison.
State and local governments also currently regulate tobacco products, including nicotine-containing vaping products. Certain states and municipalities have enacted local ordinances that prohibit the use of e-liquid, e-cigarette and other vaping products where traditional tobacco-burning cigarettes cannot be used, and certain state and local jurisdictions have enacted total or partial bans on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including e-liquid, e-cigarette and other vaping products. A growing number of states have imposed excise taxes on e-liquids, e-cigarettes, and other vaping products. Other states and local jurisdictions imposed restrictions or prohibitions on internet sales of such products, and have challenged the marketing of such products under consumer protection statutes (e.g., on the basis that certain marketers unlawfully target underage consumers or make unsubstantiated or misleading claims about their products). See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of applicable government regulation of e-liquids.

In response to COVID-19, we focused on business continuity, health and safety of our employees, and adapting our ways of working to a new environment. We quickly implemented additional safety measures to protect essential employees in our offices and facilities, including social distancing protocols, face covering requirements, temperature checks, and additional cleaning and sanitation practices. We also enhanced remote-work arrangements and digital collaboration and related risk management. 
Supply Chain Human Rights Matters
We support efforts to address human rights concerns in the tobacco supply chain. For example, in our tobacco supply chain, we use on-farm good agricultural practices assessments to assess growers’ compliance with labor practices. Our subsidiaries establish contract terms and conditions with tobacco suppliers related to issues such as forced and child labor, and they conduct social compliance due diligence throughout our tobacco-growing regions.
Environmental Compliance
Currently, there are no material estimated capital expenditures related to environmental control facilities. In addition, there is no material effect on capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position anticipated as a result of compliance with current or pending federal or state laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment.

Forward-looking Statements
10 


We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor calls and webcasts, which are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as “strategy,” “expects,” “continues,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “will,” “estimates,” “intends,” “projects,” “goals,” “targets” and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in the Company’s securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, this Annual Report includes disclosure of risks and uncertainties, including in "Item 1A. Risk Factors", that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. Any such statement is qualified by reference to these cautionary statements. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, the risks and uncertainties identified in this Annual Report should not be considered a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as may be required by law.
