Item 1.Business
Overview
Halozyme Therapeutics Inc. is a biopharma technology platform company that provides innovative and disruptive solutions with the goal of improving patient experience and outcomes. Our proprietary enzyme, rHuPH20, is used to facilitate the delivery of injected drugs and fluids. We license our technology to biopharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop products that combine our ENHANZE® drug delivery technology with the collaborators’ proprietary compounds. 
Our approved product and our collaborators’ approved products and product candidates are based on rHuPH20, our patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme. rHuPH20 is the active ingredient in our first commercially approved product, Hylenex® recombinant (Hylenex), and it works by breaking down hyaluronan (or HA), a naturally occurring carbohydrate that is a major component of the extracellular matrix in tissues throughout the body such as skin and cartilage. This temporarily increases dispersion and absorption allowing for improved subcutaneous delivery of injectable biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies and other large therapeutic molecules, as well as small molecules and fluids. We refer to the application of rHuPH20 to facilitate the delivery of other drugs or fluids as our ENHANZE® drug delivery technology (ENHANZE). We license the ENHANZE technology to form collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies that develop or market drugs requiring or benefiting from injection via the subcutaneous route of administration. In the development of proprietary intravenous (IV) drugs combined with our ENHANZE technology, data have been generated supporting the potential for ENHANZE to reduce treatment burden, as a result of shorter duration of subcutaneous (SC) administration. ENHANZE may enable fixed-dose SC dosing compared to weight-based dosing required for IV administration, and potentially allow for lower rates of infusion related reactions. ENHANZE may enable more flexible treatment options such as home administration by a healthcare professional or potentially the patient. Lastly, certain proprietary drugs co-formulated with ENHANZE have been granted additional exclusivity, extending the patent life of the product beyond the one of the proprietary IV drug.
We currently have ENHANZE collaborations with F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (Roche), Baxalta US Inc. and Baxalta GmbH (now members of the Takeda group of companies, following the acquisition of Shire plc by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited in January 2019) (Baxalta), Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), AbbVie, Inc. (AbbVie), Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), Alexion Pharma Holding (Alexion), ARGENX BVBA (argenx) and Horizon Therapeutics plc. (Horizon). We receive royalties from three of these collaborations, including royalties from sales of one product from the Baxalta collaboration, three products from the Roche collaboration and one product from the Janssen collaboration. Future potential revenues from royalties and fees from ENHANZE collaborations and the sales and/or royalties of our approved products will depend on the ability of Halozyme and our collaborators to develop, manufacture, secure and maintain regulatory approvals for approved products and product candidates and commercialize product candidates.
Our principal offices and research facilities are located at 11388 Sorrento Valley Road, San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is (858) 794-8889 and our e-mail address is info@halozyme.com. Our website address is www.halozyme.com. Information found on, or accessible through, our website is not a part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our periodic and current reports that we filed with the SEC are available on our website at www.halozyme.com, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we have electronically filed such material with, or furnished them to, the SEC, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports.
Technology
rHuPH20 can be applied as a drug delivery platform to increase dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and fluids potentially reducing treatment burden. For example, rHuPH20 has been used to convert drugs that must be delivered intravenously into subcutaneous injections or to reduce the number of subcutaneous injections needed for effective therapy. When ENHANZE technology is applied subcutaneously, the rHuPH20 acts locally and transiently, with a tissue half-life of less than 15 minutes. HA at the local site reconstitutes its normal density within a few days and, therefore, the effect of rHuPH20 on the architecture of the subcutaneous space is temporary. 
Strategy
We are a leader in converting IV biologics to subcutaneous delivery using our commercially-validated ENHANZE technology. We collaborate with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to help them develop products that combine our ENHANZE technology with their proprietary compounds. We target large, attractive markets, where ENHANZE-enabled subcutaneous delivery has the potential to deliver competitive differentiation and other important benefits to our partners, such as larger injection volumes administered rapidly, extended dosing intervals, and reduced treatment burden and healthcare costs. In addition, ENHANZE has been demonstrated to enable the combination of two therapeutic antibodies in a single injection, as well as the development of new co-formulation intellectual property. We leverage our strategic, technical, regulatory and alliance management skills in support of our partners' efforts to develop new subcutaneously delivered products. We currently have ten collaborations with five current product approvals and additional product candidates in development using our ENHANZE technology. We intend to work with our existing collaborators to expand our collaborations to add new targets and develop targets and product candidates under the terms of the operative collaboration agreements. We will also continue our efforts to enter into new collaborations to further derive additional value from our proprietary technology. 
Product and Product Candidates
We currently have one marketed proprietary product and five marketed partnered products. The following table summarizes our proprietary product, marketed partnered products and product candidates under development with our collaborators:
Proprietary Product
Hylenex Recombinant (hyaluronidase human injection)
Hylenex recombinant is a formulation of rHuPH20 that facilitates subcutaneous fluid administration for achieving hydration, to increase the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and, in subcutaneous urography, to improve resorption of radiopaque agents. Hylenex recombinant is currently the number one prescribed branded hyaluronidase. 
ENHANZE Collaborations
Roche Collaboration
In December 2006, we and Roche entered into a collaboration and license agreement under which Roche obtained a worldwide license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rHuPH20 and up to thirteen Roche target compounds (the Roche Collaboration). Under this agreement, Roche elected a total of eight targets, two of which are exclusive. 
In September 2013, Roche launched a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of Herceptin (trastuzumab) (Herceptin SC) in Europe for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer followed by launches in additional countries. This formulation utilizes our ENHANZE technology and is administered in two to five minutes, compared to 30 to 90 minutes with the standard intravenous form. In September 2018, we announced that Roche received approval from Health Canada for Herceptin SC for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. In February 2019, we announced that Roche received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Herceptin SC under the brand name Herceptin Hylecta™ (trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk). In April 2019, Roche made Herceptin Hylecta available in the U.S.
Directed at the same target, Roche initiated a Phase 1 study of Perjeta® (pertuzumab) and Herceptin (trastuzumab) using ENHANZE technology in patients with early breast cancer in March 2016. In June 2018, Roche initiated a global Phase 3 study of a fixed-dose combination of Perjeta and Herceptin using ENHANZE technology in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. In August 2019, the global phase 3 study met its primary endpoint. The study results demonstrated non-inferior levels of Perjeta in the blood (pharmacokinetics) compared to standard intravenous (IV) infusion of Perjeta plus Herceptin and chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The study also demonstrated that the safety profile of the fixed dose subcutaneous combination of Perjeta and Herceptin was consistent with the safety profile of Perjeta and Herceptin administered intravenously. In June 2020, the FDA approved the fixed-dose combination of Perjeta and Herceptin for subcutaneous injection utilizing ENHANZE technology (Phesgo®) for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. In December 2020, the European Commission (EC) also approved Phesgo for the treatment of patients with early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.
In June 2014, Roche launched MabThera SC in Europe for the treatment of patients with common forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) followed by launches in additional countries. This formulation utilizes our ENHANZE technology and is administered in approximately five minutes compared to the approximately 1.5 to 4 hour intravenous infusion. In May 2016, Roche announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Mabthera SC to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In June 2017, the FDA approved Genentech’s RITUXAN HYCELA™, a combination of rituximab using ENHANZE technology (approved and marketed under the MabThera SC brand in countries outside the U.S. and Canada), for CLL and two types of NHL, follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In March 2018, Health Canada approved a combination of rituximab and rHuPH20 (approved and marketed under the brand name RITUXAN® SC) for patients with CLL.
In September 2017, we and Roche entered into an agreement providing Roche the right to develop and commercialize one additional exclusive target using ENHANZE technology. The upfront license payment may be followed by event-based payments subject to Roche’s achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, Roche will pay royalties to us if products under the collaboration are commercialized.
In October 2018, we entered into an agreement with Roche for the right to develop and commercialize one additional exclusive target and an option to select two additional targets within four years using ENHANZE technology. The upfront license payment may be followed by event-based payments subject to Roche’s achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, Roche will pay royalties to us if products under the collaboration are commercialized.
In December 2018, Roche initiated a Phase 1b/2 study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer for Tecentriq (atezolizumab) using ENHANZE technology. In September 2020, Roche presented a poster with data from Part 1 of its Phase 1b study (IMscin001) evaluating atezolizumab (Tecentriq) for subcutaneous administration utilizing ENHANZE technology in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer at the ESMO Virtual Congress 2020. The poster concluded that atezolizumab utilizing ENHANZE technology provided similar exposure as atezolizumab IV and that results support further development of subcutaneous atezolizumab in IMscin001 Part 2, a confirmatory Phase 3 study. In December 2020, Roche initiated a Phase 3 study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer for Tecentriq using ENHANZE technology.
 In August 2019, Roche initiated a Phase 1 study evaluating OCREVUS (ocrelizumab) with ENHANZE technology in subjects with multiple sclerosis. 
In October 2019, Roche nominated a new undisclosed target to be studied using ENHANZE technology, triggering a $10 million milestone payment.
Baxalta Collaboration
In September 2007, we and Baxalta entered into a collaboration and license agreement under which Baxalta obtained a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rHuPH20 with GAMMAGARD LIQUID (HYQVIA) (the Baxalta Collaboration). HYQVIA is indicated for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders associated with defects in the immune system.
In May 2013, the European Commission granted Baxalta marketing authorization in all EU Member States for the use of HYQVIA (solution for subcutaneous use) as replacement therapy for adult patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. Baxalta launched HYQVIA in the first EU country in July 2013 and has continued to launch in additional countries.
In September 2014, HYQVIA was approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with primary immunodeficiency in the U.S. HYQVIA is the first subcutaneous immune globulin (IG) treatment approved for adult primary immunodeficiency patients with a dosing regimen requiring only one infusion up to once per month (every three to four weeks) and one injection site per infusion in most patients, to deliver a full therapeutic dose of IG. The FDA’s approval of HYQVIA was a significant milestone for us as it represented the first U.S. approved BLA which utilizes our rHuPH20 platform. 
In May 2016, Baxalta announced that HYQVIA received a marketing authorization from the European Commission for a pediatric indication, which was launched in Europe to treat primary and certain secondary immunodeficiencies. In September 2020, Takeda announced that the EMA approved a label update for HYQVIA broadening its use and making it the first and only facilitated subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy in adults, adolescents and children with an expanded range of secondary immunodeficiencies (SID).
Pfizer Collaboration
In December 2012, we and Pfizer entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Pfizer has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Pfizer proprietary biologics in primary care and specialty care indications. Pfizer has elected five targets and has returned two targets. 
Janssen Collaboration
In December 2014, we and Janssen entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Janssen has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Janssen proprietary biologics directed to up to five targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. Janssen has elected CD38 as the first target on an exclusive basis. Janssen has initiated seven Phase 3 studies, two Phase 2 study and one Phase 1 study of DARZALEX® (daratumumab), directed at CD38, using ENHANZE technology in patients with amyloidosis, smoldering myeloma and multiple myeloma. 
In February 2019, Janssen’s development partner, Genmab, announced positive Phase 3 trial results from the COLUMBA study evaluating subcutaneous DARZALEX in comparison to DARZALEX IV in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. DARZALEX SC (utilizing ENHANZE technology) was found to be non-inferior to Darzalex IV with regard the co-primary endpoints of Overall Response Rate and Maximum Trough concentration. In May 2020, we announced that Janssen received US FDA approval and launched the commercial sale of DARZALEX FASPRO in four regimens across five indications in multiple myeloma patients, including newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible patients as well as relapsed or refractory patients. As a fixed-dose formulation, DARZALEX FASPRO can be administered over three to five minutes, significantly less time than IV DARZALEX which requires multi-hour infusions. In June 2020, we announced that Janssen received European marketing authorization and launched the commercial sale of DARZALEX SC utilizing ENHANZE in the European Union. In April 2020, we announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) by Janssen seeking approval of DARZALEX SC. In November 2020, Janssen announced it submitted a Type II variation application to the EMA seeking European approval of DARZALEX SC to be used in the 
treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis, a rare and potentially fatal disease for which there are no currently approved therapies. In August 2020, Janssen announced that Health Canada approved DARZALEX SC in four regimens across five indications in patients with multiple myeloma, most notably newly diagnosed, trans-plant-ineligible patients as well as relapsed or refractory patients. In November 2020, Janssen filed for approval of DARZALEX FASPRO/Darzalex SC with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the U.S. and EU. In January 2021, Janssen received FDA approval for DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. In January 2021, Janssen received accelerated approval from the FDA for DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (D-VCd) for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis (not recommended for the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis who have NYHA Class IIIB or Class IV cardiac disease or Mayo Stage IIIB outside of controlled clinical trials). 
In December 2019, Janssen elected targets EGFR and cMET on an exclusive basis as part of the bispecific antibody (amivantamab), which is being studied in solid tumors. In November 2020, Janssen initiated a Phase 1 study of amivantamab and ENHANZE. 
AbbVie Collaboration
In June 2015, we and AbbVie entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which AbbVie has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with AbbVie proprietary biologics directed to up to nine targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. AbbVie elected one target on an exclusive basis, TNF alpha, for which it has discontinued development and returned the target.
Lilly Collaboration
In December 2015, we and Lilly entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Lilly has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Lilly proprietary biologics directed to up to five targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. Lilly has elected two targets on an exclusive basis and one target on a semi-exclusive basis. In August 2017, Lilly initiated a Phase 1 study of an investigational therapy in combination with rHuPH20.
BMS Collaboration
In September 2017, we and BMS entered into a collaboration and license agreement, which became effective in November 2017, under which BMS has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with BMS products directed at up to eleven targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. BMS has designated multiple immuno-oncology targets including programmed death 1 (PD-1) and has an option to select additional targets within five years from the effective date. In October 2018, BMS dosed the first patient in a Phase 1/2a study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BMS-986179, an investigational anti-CD-73 antibody alone and in combination with nivolumab, using ENHANZE technology. BMS is also conducting a Phase 1/2 study of nivolumab using ENHANZE technology in patients with solid tumors. In October 2019, BMS initiated a Phase 1 study for relatlimab in combination with nivolumab using ENHANZE technology. In June 2020, BMS initiated a Phase 1/2 study of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab using ENHANZE technology, but has recently made a portfolio prioritization decision to not continue the study. In June 2020, BMS selected 3 targets on an exclusive basis and exercised their option to convert a co-exclusive license to an exclusive license. BMS has selected eight targets on an exclusive basis to-date.
Alexion Collaboration
In December 2017, we and Alexion entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Alexion has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Alexion’s portfolio of products directed at up to four targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. Alexion elected two targets on an exclusive basis, including a C5 complement inhibitor and has an option to select two additional targets within five years from the effective date. In August 2018, Alexion announced that it initiated a Phase 1 trial to study a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 using ENHANZE technology (ALXN1810). In April 2020 Alexion announced it would no longer proceed with a study of ALXN1810 in renal disease. Following a portfolio prioritization, Alexion has made the decision to not proceed with further development of ALXN1810, subcutaneous ULTOMIRIS co-administered with ENHANZE technology. Alexion is evaluating additional development options for ENHANZE.
argenx Collaboration 
In February 2019, we and argenx entered into an agreement for the right to develop and commercialize one exclusive target, the human neonatal Fc receptor FcRn, which includes argenx's lead asset efgartigimod (ARGX-113), and an option to select two additional targets using ENHANZE technology. In May 2019, argenx nominated a second target to be studied using ENHANZE technology, a human complement factor C2 associated with the product candidate ARGX-117, which is being developed to treat severe autoimmune diseases. 
In July 2019, argenx dosed the first subject in a phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of efgartigimod (ARGX-113), using ENHANZE technology. In December 2019, argenx reported that based on data from the phase 1 study and internal company analysis, a one minute injection administered every 2 weeks may be possible. In December 2020, argenx initiated a Phase 3 study of ARGX-113 using ENHANZE technology for patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an immune disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. In January 2021, argenx initiated a Phase 3 study of ARGX-113 using ENHANZE technology in pemphigus vulgaris and foliaceus (PV), a rare autoimmune disease that causes painful blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. In February 2021, argenx initiated a Phase 3 study of ARGX-113 using ENHANZE technology for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and initiated a Phase 3 study of ARGX-113 using ENHANZE technology in myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder of the musculoskeletal system caused by IgG autoantibodies.
In October 2020, we and argenx entered into agreement to expand the collaboration relationship. Under the newly announced expansion, argenx gained the ability to exclusively access our ENHANZE technology for three additional targets upon nomination for a total of up to six targets under the existing and newly expanded collaboration.
Horizon Collaboration
In November 2020, we and Horizon entered into a global collaboration and license agreement that gives Horizon exclusive access to Halozyme's ENHANZE technology for subcutaneous formulation of medicines targeting IGF-1R. Horizon intends to use ENHANZE to develop a SC formulation of TEPEZZA (teprotumumab-trbw), indicated for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune disease, potentially shortening drug administration time, reducing healthcare practitioner time and offering additional flexibility and convenience for patients.
NIH CRADA
In June 2019, we announced a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Vaccine Research Center (VRC), part of National Institute of Health (NIH), enabling the VRC’s use of ENHANZE technology to develop subcutaneous formulations of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV for HIV treatment. The initiation of this study has been impacted by COVID-19 and is delayed.
CAPRISA
In September 2020, we entered into a collaboration with the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), a non-profit company, to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a human monoclonal antibody (CAP256V2LS) in HIV-negative and HIV-positive women in South Africa. In October 2020, we were notified that the first patient was dosed with PH20 in a Phase I Dose-Escalation Study for CAP256V2LS.
For a further discussion of the collaboration agreements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues under Collaborative Agreements.
Impact of COVID-19 to our Business
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a disease caused by a strain of novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and in compliance with state regulations, we instituted working from home, limited the number of people that work on site at any one time, and suspended employee travel. We anticipate that the global health crisis caused by COVID-19 will continue to have an impact across the globe. As an organization we continue to effectively operate with the majority of our employees working from home and not traveling, which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future. Importantly, our suppliers continue to operate without interruption related to COVID-19. However, the duration of the pandemic and its continued impact on the global economy as a whole is unknown at this time. We are not clear the extent to which near term and long term operational and economic impacts of COVID-19, if any, will have on our business, including the effects on our suppliers, collaborators, customers, employees, and prospects. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our inventions, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Our strategy is to actively pursue patent protection in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary to us and that offers us a potential competitive advantage. Our patent portfolio includes 43 issued patents in the U.S., more than 460 issued patents in Europe and other countries in the world and more than 50 pending patent applications. In general, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date. Our issued patents will expire between 2023 and 2035. While we recently abandoned a number of patents related to PEGPH20 as a result of its failed Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, we continue to file and prosecute patent applications to strengthen and grow our patent portfolio pertaining to our recombinant human hyaluronidase. We have multiple patents and patent applications throughout the world pertaining to our recombinant human hyaluronidase and methods of use and manufacture, including an issued U.S. patent which expires in 2027 and an issued European patent which expires in 2024, which we believe cover the products and product candidates under our existing collaborations and Hylenex recombinant. In addition, we have, under prosecution throughout the world, multiple patent applications that relate specifically to individual product candidates under development, the expiration of which can only be definitely determined upon maturation into our issued patents. We believe our patent filings represent a barrier to entry for potential competitors looking to utilize these hyaluronidases.
In addition to patents, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. Our policy is to require our employees, directors, consultants, advisors, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, other advisors and other individuals and entities to execute confidentiality agreements upon the start of employment, consulting or other contractual relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some other parties, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual will be our exclusive property. Despite the use of these agreements and our efforts to protect our intellectual property, there will always be a risk of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.
We also file trademark applications to protect the names of our products and product candidates. These applications may not mature to registration and may be challenged by third parties. We are pursuing trademark protection in a number of different countries around the world. There can be no assurances that our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names will not infringe on rights of third parties or will be acceptable to regulatory agencies.
Research and Development Activities
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the product development, quality and regulatory work required to maintain the ENHANZE platform, development and manufacturing of product candidates performed on behalf of our partners, compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel, supplies and materials, facility costs and amortization and depreciation. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred. Prior to our November 2019 restructuring, our research and development activities were primarily focused on the development of PEGPH20.
Manufacturing
We do not have our own manufacturing facility for our product and our partners’ products and product candidates, or the capability to package our products. We have engaged third parties to manufacture bulk rHuPH20 and Hylenex.
We have existing supply agreements with contract manufacturing organizations Avid Bioservices, Inc. (Avid) and Catalent Indiana LLC (Catalent) to produce supplies of bulk rHuPH20. These manufacturers each produce bulk rHuPH20 under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) for clinical and commercial uses. Catalent currently produces bulk rHuPH20 for use in Hylenex and collaboration product candidates. Avid currently produces bulk rHuPH20 for use in collaboration products. We rely on their ability to successfully manufacture these batches according to product specifications. It is important for our business for Catalent and Avid to (i) retain their status as cGMP-approved manufacturing facilities; (ii) successfully scale up bulk rHuPH20 production; and/or (iii) manufacture the bulk rHuPH20 required by us and our collaborators for use in our proprietary and collaboration products and product candidates. In addition to supply obligations, Avid and Catalent will also provide support for data and information used in the chemistry, manufacturing and controls sections for FDA and other regulatory filings.
We have a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon Manufacturing Services, LLC (Patheon) under which Patheon will provide the final fill and finishing steps in the production process of Hylenex recombinant. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Hylenex Recombinant
Our commercial activities currently focus on Hylenex recombinant. We have a team of sales specialists that provide hospital and surgery center customers with the information about Hylenex recombinant and information needed to obtain formulary approval for, and support utilization of, Hylenex recombinant. Our commercial activities also include marketing and related services and commercial support services such as commercial operations, managed markets and commercial analytics. We also employ third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support related services to assist with our commercial activities.
We sell Hylenex recombinant in the U.S. to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who sell the product to hospitals and other end-user customers. We engage Integrated Commercialization Solutions (ICS), a division of AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen, to act as our exclusive distributor for commercial shipment and distribution of Hylenex recombinant to our customers in the United States. In addition to distribution services, ICS provides us with other key services related to logistics, warehousing, returns and inventory management, contract administration and chargebacks processing and accounts receivable management. In addition, we utilize third parties to perform various other services for us relating to regulatory monitoring, including call center management, adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our product or product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, drug development experience, sales and marketing capabilities, including larger, well established sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than us. We face competition not only in the commercialization of Hylenex but also for the out-licensing of our ENHANZE technology. Our ENHANZE technology may face increasing competition from alternate approaches and/or emerging technologies to deliver medicines SC. In addition, our collaborators face competition in the commercialization of the product candidates for which the collaborators seek marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities.
Hylenex Recombinant
Hylenex recombinant is currently the only FDA approved recombinant human hyaluronidase on the market. The competitors for Hylenex recombinant include, but are not limited to, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.’s product, Vitrase®, an ovine (ram) hyaluronidase, and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s product, Amphadase®, a bovine (bull) hyaluronidase.
Government Regulations
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries regulate the manufacture and sale of the pharmaceutical products that we or our partners have developed or that our partners currently are developing. The FDA has established guidelines and safety standards that are applicable to the laboratory and preclinical evaluation and clinical investigation of therapeutic products and stringent regulations that govern the manufacture and sale of these products. The process of obtaining regulatory approval for a new therapeutic product usually requires a significant amount of time and substantial resources. 
Regulatory obligations continue post-approval and include the reporting of adverse events when a drug is utilized in the broader patient population. Promotion and marketing of drugs is also strictly regulated, with penalties imposed for violations of FDA regulations, the Lanham Act and other federal and state laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute.
We currently intend to continue to seek, through our collaborators, approval to market products and product candidates in foreign countries, which may have regulatory processes that differ materially from those of the FDA. Our partners may rely upon independent consultants to seek and gain approvals to market our proposed products in foreign countries or may rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to license our proposed products. We cannot guarantee that approvals to market any of our partners’ products can be obtained in any country. Approval to market a product in any one foreign country does not necessarily indicate that approval can be obtained in other countries.
From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drug products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or reviewing courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and development of our partners’ product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. It is impossible to predict

Human Capital Management
The experience, expertise and dedication of our employees drive the progress and accomplishments of Halozyme. 
As of February 17, 2021, we had 136 full-time employees. None of our employees are unionized and we believe our employee relations to be good. 
Recognizing the value of our employees and the contributions they make in achieving our business objectives and overall success, we focus on creating and providing an inclusive and safe work environment where employees are respected and rewarded for their contributions, work together as one team, have opportunities to grow and develop their careers, and support the communities in which we work. We also believe this approach to human capital management is essential to attracting and retaining employees in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical labor market. To achieve this supportive working environment, our human capital management efforts focus on:
Corporate Values and Ethics:
The foundation of our human capital management strategy is contained in our corporate values statement and our Code of Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”), both of which provide uniform guidance to all our employees regarding expectations for proper workplace behavior. Our corporate values emphasize respecting and valuing fellow team members and acting with integrity and honesty to uphold the highest ethical standards. We believe these values provide an environment in which all employees can feel proud and motivated to contribute their valued talents to achieving corporate goals and objectives. Our values also emphasize empowering employees and personal accountability as a means to fulfill our commitments to patients, partners, shareholders and each other.
Our Board of Directors adopted and regularly reviews the Code of Conduct, which applies to all of our employees, officers and directors. Adherence to the Code of Conduct helps ensure that all employees can feel a part of an organization that emphasizes adherence to laws and policies covering the industry in which we work. Our Code of Conduct also emphasizes each employee’s accountability for making decisions and taking actions in a highly ethical manner with a focus on honesty, fairness and integrity and treating all fellow employees in a respectful and inclusive manner. We have established a reporting hotline that enables employees to file anonymous reports of any suspected violations of the Code of Conduct. We believe that providing an ethical environment in which to work is vital to our efforts to attract, retain and develop our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion:
We seek to build and maintain a diverse team of employees that is passionate about and committed to having a positive impact on the lives of patients and their families. We value and celebrate the unique talents, backgrounds and perspectives each employee contributes to achieving our mission and corporate objectives. In support of this philosophy, we adopted the Biotechnology Innovation Organization’s principles on workforce development, diversity and inclusion. Our diverse and inclusive culture is key to attract, develop and retain our talent pool within the globally competitive biotechnology industry. Our dedication to these principles has resulted in a diverse and inclusive employee base consisting of 51% female and 40% non-white/Caucasian employees as of February 17, 2021.
As an equal opportunity employer, we strive to attract and connect with diverse talent who best match our core values and who will be successful and thrive at Halozyme. Our recruiting team partners with hiring managers and with our diverse interview panels to provide support at every stage of the process. We strive to ensure we evaluate a diverse group of candidates for every role with the goal of identifying the best possible candidate – whether internal or external – to fill open roles in the company. We are also committed to providing a positive candidate experience and endeavor to be transparent and respect the time each candidate gives us throughout the process. We evaluate our recruitment and retention efforts based on a variety of metrics, including offer acceptance rate, time-to-hire, turnover and diversity of our employees.
Professional Development for Employees at All Levels:
We are firmly committed to employee development because it is essential to the future growth and overall success of Halozyme. We understand that high performing employees are always searching for ways to broaden and develop their skills. To support our employees, we conduct an individual development plan process to give employees the opportunity and accountability to document their career goals and the actions necessary to achieve those goals. Our senior leader development program is focused on advancing business acumen and leadership skills. Our talent development curriculum for the entire organization is focused on professional, team and leadership development opportunities and grounded in our established leadership attributes which identify the knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors that contribute to individual and organizational performance. In addition, we provide an online learning platform where employees can access training or 
programs on a variety of topics whenever they choose. We offer education assistance for college and university courses, training seminars and educational conferences to all employees. 
To monitor progress, we review our succession plan for key senior management positions as part of our annual talent review and identify development opportunities to help ensure potential successor readiness. 
Employee Engagement:
In order to ensure we are delivering on our human capital initiatives and better understand our employees’ experience, we regularly conduct employee engagement surveys. In 2019, we achieved a 97% response rate with our survey with more than 90% of our employees indicating: 
•They are aware of the company mission and vision and have a clear understanding of the goals and objectives of the company; 
•Their team is committed to doing high quality work; and
•Their manager treats them with respect and cares about them. 
With the goal of continuous performance improvement we are focused on further strengthening cross-functional team work including how team members communicate and hold each other accountable. Examples of specific actions we have taken in response to employee survey feedback include institution of all-employee training on cross-functional teamwork and how to have crucial conversations.
We hold frequent all-employee meetings that serve as a forum to share progress on strategy and corporate goals, celebrate achievements, and share best practices and learnings. In 2020 and continuing in 2021 we have increased the frequency of our all-employee meetings from monthly to every other week while implementing our work-from-home strategy in response to COVID-19, in order to keep employees well-informed and connected and to addresses their questions.
Management tracks and assesses retention and attrition and interviews departing employees in order to identify any addressable trends.
Compensation & Benefits:
Our compensation and benefits programs, with oversight from the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, are designed to attract, retain and reward employees through competitive salaries, annual bonus eligibility, stock awards grants to all employees, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs. Each year we conduct surveys to benchmark our salaries and benefits and confirm we are satisfied with the competitiveness of our total compensation offering. We also provide a variety of peer-to-peer and corporate recognition programs to celebrate and recognize our employees for their hard work and contributions.
Employee Health and Safety:
We are dedicated to promoting the health and safety of our employees because we believe it fosters employee productivity and job performance. We have developed and implemented annual workplace safety training which is intended to remind our employees of workplace safety procedures that may be useful in the event of emergency situations and to assist our employees in helping to prevent workplace accidents. We have established a Safety Committee which meets on a quarterly basis to review workplace safety and adherence to safety policies. Further, our Code of Conduct emphasizes our commitment to preventing unlawful employment discrimination and workplace harassment including mandatory, on going sexual harassment training and provides a mechanism for reporting any violations of this policy. 
Our response to COVID-19:
Because we take the health and safety of our employees, their families and our local communities very seriously, we have implemented the following actions to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 in our office and in the local community, while ensuring that critical work continues:

Corporate Citizenship:

•STEM education;
