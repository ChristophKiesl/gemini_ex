ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 
Overview
Hexion Inc. (“Hexion” or the “Company”), a New Jersey corporation with predecessors dating from 1899, is one of the world’s largest producers of thermosetting resins, or thermosets, and a leading producer of adhesive and structural resins and coatings. Thermosetting resins include materials such as phenolic resins, epoxy resins and urethane resins. Our products include a broad range of critical components and formulations used to impart valuable performance characteristics such as durability, gloss, heat resistance, adhesion, and strength to our customers and their customers’ final products. We serve highly diversified growing end-markets such as residential and non-residential construction, wind energy, industrial, automotive, consumer goods, and electronics. 
 Our business is organized based on the products we offer and the markets we serve. At December 31, 2019, we had three reportable segments: Forest Products Resins; Epoxy, Phenolic and Coating Resins; and Corporate and Other. Effective January 1, 2020, we have changed our segment reporting structure and aligned the reporting structure around two growth platforms: Adhesives; and Coatings and Composites. Corporate and Other will continue to be a reportable segment. See Note 18 in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 
Emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
On April 1, 2019, the Company, Hexion Holdings LLC, Hexion LLC and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) for reorganization under Chapter 11 (“Chapter 11”) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Chapter 11 proceedings were jointly administered under the caption In re Hexion TopCo, LLC, No. 19-10684 (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). The Debtors continued to operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
On June 25, 2019, the Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Hexion Holdings LLC and its Debtor Affiliates under Chapter 11 (the “Plan”). On the morning of July 1, 2019, in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Confirmation Order, the Plan became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy (the “Emergence”).
As a result of our reorganization and emergence from Chapter 11 on the morning of July 1, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), our direct parent is Hexion Intermediate Holding 2, Inc. (“Hexion Intermediate”), a holding company and wholly owned subsidiary of Hexion Intermediate Holding 1, Inc., a holding company and wholly owned subsidiary of Hexion Holdings Corporation, the ultimate parent of Hexion (“Hexion Holdings”). Prior to its reorganization, the Company’s parent was Hexion LLC, a holding company and wholly owned subsidiary of Hexion Holdings LLC (now known as Hexion TopCo, LLC or “TopCo”), the previous ultimate parent entity of Hexion, which was controlled by investment funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Management Holdings, L.P. (together with Apollo Global Management, Inc. and its subsidiaries, “Apollo”).

Fresh Start Accounting
On the Effective Date, in accordance with ASC 852, the Company applied fresh start accounting to its financial statements as (i) the holders of existing voting shares of the Company prior to its emergence received less than 50% of the voting shares of the Company outstanding following its emergence from bankruptcy and (ii) the reorganization value of the Company’s assets immediately prior to confirmation of the plan of reorganization was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims. Fresh start accounting was applied to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of July 1, 2019, the date it emerged from bankruptcy, which resulted in a new basis of accounting and the Company became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result, the Company allocated the reorganization value of the Company to its individual assets based on their estimated fair values. Reorganization value represents the fair value of the Company’s assets before considering liabilities. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets was reported as goodwill. Refer to Note 4 in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Financial Results Summary
Our financial results for the period from January 1, 2019 through July 1, 2019 and for fiscal years ended 2018 and 2017 are referred to as those of the “Predecessor” period. Our financial results for the period from July 2, 2019 through December 31, 2019 are referred to as those of the “Successor” period. Our results of operations as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements for these periods are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which requires that we report on our results for the period from January 1, 2019 through July 1, 2019 and the period from July 2, 2019 through December 31, 2019 separately. 
We do not believe that reviewing the results of these periods in isolation would be useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding our overall operating performance. We believe that the key performance metrics such as Net sales, Operating income and Segment EBITDA for the Successor period when combined with the 2019 Predecessor period provides more meaningful comparisons to other periods and are useful in identifying current business trends. Accordingly, in addition to presenting our results of operations as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the tables and discussions below also present the combined results for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
The combined results (referenced as “Non-GAAP Combined” or “Combined”) for the year ended December 31, 2019, which we refer to herein as results for the “Year Ended December 31, 2019” represent the sum of the reported amounts for the Predecessor period January 1, 2019 through July 1, 2019 combined with the Successor period from July 2, 2019 through December 31, 2019. These Combined results are not considered to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and have not been prepared as pro forma results under applicable regulations. The Non-GAAP Combined operating results are presented for supplemental purposes only, may not reflect the actual results we would have achieved absent our emergence from bankruptcy, may not be indicative of future results and should not be viewed as a substitute for the financial results of the Predecessor period and Successor period presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

In 2019, our revenue base included sales in the following end markets: 
Industry & Competitors
We are a large participant in the specialty chemicals industry. Thermosetting resins are generally considered specialty chemical products because they are sold primarily on the basis of performance, technical support, product innovation and customer service. However, as a result of the impact of the ongoing global economic uncertainty and overcapacity in certain markets, certain of our competitors have focused more on price to retain business and market share, which we have selectively followed in certain markets to maintain market share and remain a market leader.
We compete with many companies in most of our product lines, including large global chemical companies and small specialty chemical companies. No single company competes with us across all of our segments and existing product lines. The principal competitive factors in our industry include technical service, breadth of product offerings, product innovation, product quality and price. Some of our competitors are larger, have greater financial resources and may be able to better withstand adverse changes in industry conditions, including pricing, and the economy as a whole. Further, our competitors may have more resources to support continued expansion than we do. Some of our competitors also have a greater range of products and may be more vertically integrated than we are within specific product lines or geographies.
We believe that the principal factors that contribute to success in the specialty chemicals market, and our ability to maintain our position in the markets we serve, are (i) consistent delivery of high-quality products; (ii) favorable process economics; (iii) the ability to provide value to customers through both product attributes and strong technical service and (iv) an international footprint and presence in growing and developing markets.

Our Corporate and Other segment primarily includes corporate general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the other segments, such as shared service and administrative functions, foreign exchange gains and losses and legacy company costs.
For additional information about our segments, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Marketing, Customers and Seasonality
Our products are sold to industrial users worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force that services our larger customers and third-party distributors that more cost-effectively serve our smaller customers. Our customer service and support network is made up of key regional customer service centers. We have global account teams that serve the major needs of our global customers for technical service and supply and commercial term requirements. Where operating and regulatory factors vary from country to country, these functions are managed locally.

In 2019, our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales, and our top ten customers accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales. Neither our overall business nor any of our reporting segments depends on any single customer or a particular group of customers; therefore, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on either of our two reporting segments or the Company as a whole. Our primary customers are manufacturers, and the demand for our products is seasonal in certain of our businesses, with the highest demand in the summer months and lowest in the winter months. Therefore, the dollar amount of our backlog orders as of December 31, 2019 is not significant. Demand for our products can also be cyclical, as general economic health and industrial and commercial production levels are key drivers for our business. 
International Operations
Our non-U.S. operations accounted for 56%, 56% and 58% of our sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. While our international operations may be subject to a number of additional risks, such as exposure to foreign currency exchange risk, we do not believe that our foreign operations, on the whole, carry significantly greater risk than our operations in the United States. Information about sales by geographic region for the past three years and long-lived assets by geographic region for the past two years can be found in Note 18 in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. More information about our methods and actions to manage exchange risk and interest rate risk can be found in Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In 2019, our revenue base included sales in the following regions:
Raw Materials
In 2019, we purchased approximately $2.0 billion of raw materials, representing approximately 75% of our cost of sales (excluding depreciation expense). The three largest raw materials that we use are phenol, methanol and urea, which collectively represented approximately 50% of our total raw material expenditures in 2019. The majority of raw materials that we use to manufacture our products are available from more than one source, and are readily available in the open market. We have long-term purchase agreements for certain raw materials that ensure the availability of adequate supply. These agreements generally have periodic price adjustment mechanisms and do not have minimum annual purchase requirements. Smaller quantity materials that are single sourced generally have long-term supply contracts to maximize supply reliability. Prices for our main feedstocks are generally driven by underlying petrochemical benchmark prices and energy costs, which are subject to price fluctuations. Although we seek to offset increases in raw material prices with increases in our product prices, we may not always be able to do so, and there are periods when price increases lag behind raw material price increases.

 Research and Development
Our research and development activities are geared towards developing and enhancing products, processes and application technologies so that we can maintain our position as the world’s largest producer of thermosetting resins. We focus on:

• | developing new or improved applications based on our existing product lines and identified market trends;


• | developing new resin products and applications for customers to improve their competitive advantage and profitability;


• | providing premier technical service for customers of specialty products;


• | providing technical support for manufacturing locations and assisting in optimizing our manufacturing processes;


• | ensuring that our products are manufactured consistent with our global environmental, health and safety policies and objectives;


• | developing lower cost manufacturing processes globally; and


• | expanding our production capacity.

We have over 360 scientists and technicians worldwide. Our research and development facilities include a broad range of synthesis, testing and formulating equipment and small-scale versions of customer manufacturing processes for applications development and demonstration.
More recently, we have focused research and development resources on the incorporation of green chemistry principles into technology innovations to remain competitive and to address our customers’ demands for more environmentally preferred solutions. Our efforts have focused on developing resin technologies that reduce emissions, maximize efficiency and increase the use of bio-based raw materials. Some examples of meaningful results of our investment in the development of green products include:


• | EPIKOTE™ / EPIKURE™ epoxy systems for wind energy applications, which provide superior mechanical and process properties, reducing air emissions when hours of energy are created;


• | EPIKOTE™ and Bakelite® resin systems for automotive applications, which produce lightweight automotive composite components and other automotive parts that allow customers to build cars with better mileage, reducing air emissions without sacrificing performance;


• | EcoBind™ Resin Technology, an ultra low-emitting binder resin used to produce engineered wood products,


• | Epi-Rez™ Epoxy Waterborne Resins, which provide for lower volatile organic compounds, reducing air emissions; and 


• | VeoVa™ vinyl ester, a Versatics acid and derivatives product, which is an isocyanate-free resin. 

 In 2019, 2018 and 2017, our research and development and technical services expense was $50, $53 and $58, respectively. We take a customer-driven approach to discovering new applications and processes and providing customer service through our technical staff. Through regular direct contact with our key customers, our research and development associates can become aware of evolving customer needs in advance, and can anticipate their requirements to more effectively plan customer programs. We also focus on continuous improvement of plant yields and production capacity and reduction of fixed costs.
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2019, we own, license or have rights to over 750 patents and over 1,100 registered trademarks, as well as various patent and trademark applications and technology licenses around the world, which we currently use or hold for use in our operations. A majority of our patents relate to developing new products and processes for manufacturing and will expire between 2020 and 2037. We renew our trademarks on a regular basis. While we view our patents and trademarks to be valuable, because of the broad scope of our products and services, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any single patent or trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or the continuation of our business.
Industry Regulatory Matters
Domestic and international laws regulate the production and marketing of chemical substances. Almost every country has its own legal procedures for registration and import. Of these, the laws and regulations in the European Union, the United States (Toxic Substances Control Act) and China are the most significant to our business. Additionally, other laws and regulations may also limit our expansion into other countries. Chemicals that are not included on one or more of these, or any other country’s chemical inventory lists, can usually be registered and imported, but may first require additional testing or submission of additional administrative information.
The European Commission enacted a regulatory system in 2006, known as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances (“REACH”), which requires manufacturers, importers and consumers of certain chemicals to register these chemicals and evaluate their potential impact on human health and the environment. As REACH matures, significant market restrictions could be imposed on the current and future uses of chemical products that we use as raw materials or that we sell as finished products in the European Union. Other countries may also enact similar regulations. 
 10

Environmental Regulations
Our policy is to operate our plants in a manner that protects the environment, health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. We have implemented company-wide environmental, health and safety policies managed by our Environmental, Health and Safety (“EH&S”) department and overseen by the EH&S Committee of Hexion Holdings’ Board of Directors. Our EH&S department provides support and oversight to our operations worldwide to ensure compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. This responsibility is executed via training, communication of EH&S policies, formulation of relevant policies and standards, EH&S audits and incident response planning and implementation. Our EH&S policies include systems and procedures that govern environmental emissions, waste generation, process safety management, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, worker health and safety requirements, site security, emergency planning and response and product stewardship.
Our operations involve the use, handling, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and we are subject to extensive environmental regulation at the federal, state and international levels. We are also exposed to the risk of claims for environmental remediation or restoration. Our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal or modification. Violations of environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on operating activities, substantial fines, penalties, damages or other costs. In addition, statutes such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state and foreign laws impose strict, joint and several liability for investigating and remediating the consequences of spills and other releases of hazardous materials, substances and wastes at current and former facilities, as well as third-party disposal sites. Other laws permit individuals to seek recovery of damages for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances and conditions at our facilities or to hazardous substances otherwise owned, sold or controlled by us. Therefore, notwithstanding our commitment to environmental management and environmental health and safety, we may incur liabilities in the future, and these liabilities may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Although our environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with international, federal and state laws and environmental regulations, future developments and increasingly stringent regulation could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, our former operations, including our ink, wallcoverings, film, phosphate mining and processing, thermoplastics and food and dairy operations, may give rise to claims relating to our period of ownership.
We expect to incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under environmental, health and safety laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and repair pollution control equipment. In 2019, we incurred related capital expenditures of $20. We estimate that capital expenditures in 2020 for environmental controls at our facilities will be between $25 and $30. This estimate is based on current regulations and other requirements, but it is possible that a material amount of capital expenditures, in addition to those we currently anticipate, could be necessary if these regulations or other requirements or other facts change.
Employees
At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 4,000 employees. Approximately 40% of our employees are members of a labor union or are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements, including most of our European employees. We believe that we have good relations with our union and non-union employees.
Our Board of Directors expects honest and ethical conduct from every employee. We strive to adhere to the highest ethical standards in the conduct of our business and to comply with all laws and regulations that are applicable to the business. Each employee has a responsibility to maintain and advance the ethical values of the Company. In support of this, our employees receive training to emphasize the importance of compliance with our Code of Conduct.
