Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “our,” “us,” “ZIVO,” “the Registrant” or “the Company” refer to Zivo Bioscience, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
We are a research and development (“R&D”) company operating in both the biotech and agtech sectors, with an intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio comprised of proprietary algal and bacterial strains, biologically active molecules and complexes, production techniques, cultivation techniques and patented or patent-pending inventions for applications in human and animal health.
Biotech – ZIVO Product Candidates
 
ZIVO has developed bioactive compounds derived from its proprietary algal culture, targeting human and animal diseases, such as poultry coccidiosis, bovine mastitis, human cholesterol, and rheumatoid arthritis. As part of its strategy, ZIVO will continue to seek strategic partners for late-stage development, regulatory preparation and commercialization of its products in key global markets.
Agtech – ZIVO’s Algal Biomass
 
ZIVO’s algal biomass is currently produced in Arizona, India and Peru. ZIVO’s algal biomass contains Vitamin A, protein, iron, important fatty acids, non-starch polysaccharides and other micronutrients that position the product as a viable functional food ingredient and nutritional enhancement for human and animal use. The Company currently has contracts with NutriQuest, Grekin Laboratories, and others for the sale of its algal biomass. 
Wellmetrix
 
In August 2013, we acquired the assets, consisting primarily of IP rights, of Wellness Indicators, Inc. (“Wellness”), a Michigan corporation based in Illinois. Concurrently, we formed WellMetris, LLC as a 100% owned entity of ZIVO. In 2018, we changed the name of WellMetris, LLC to Wellmetrix, LLC (“Wellmetrix”). We acquired four patent applications as part of the transaction, in addition to engineering drawings, prototypes, chemical formulae, validation data, laboratory equipment and IT equipment. We assigned all of the IP acquired to Wellmetrix with a stated value of $1,391,281. 
 
For Wellmetrix, the Board and management agreed to halt active product development and instead focus on prospective out-licensing of the existing IP, consisting of a patent and several patents pending. An ongoing commitment to patent prosecution and maintenance of the existing patent has been approved by the Board.

Aquaculture: A third party aquafeed laboratory has indicated to ZIVO that early research yielded positive results regarding the suitability of ZIVO’s algal biomass for the aquafeed market. 
Our Market Opportunity
 
Biotech
 
Poultry Gut Health
 
Coccidiosis, or the inflammation of the intestinal tract, is one of the largest health and animal welfare problems facing the poultry flocks. Roughly $3.0 billion was spent in 2006 to control this condition, of which antibiotics and antimicrobials comprise a significant percentage. Consumer and regulatory pressure have created what we believe to be an opportunity to develop and market an alternative to various antimicrobials routinely mixed into chicken feed. The Company is developing a product candidate designed to boost immune response, thereby combatting a broad range of infective pathogens, with the goal of simultaneously improving feed conversion and productivity.
Bovine Mastitis
 
Bovine mastitis, or inflammation of the udder, can halt milk production and may result in unsaleable milk. The U.S. cow herd averaged 9.399 million cows in 2018 and U.S. milk production hit 217.6 billion pounds in 2018. Bovine mastitis affects approximately 1.5 million out of the 9 million dairy cows in the U.S. on an annual basis, and the average loss per cow per year in milk output is 846 pounds. Current treatments are primarily antibiotic, which requires a holding period and disposal of milk during that holding period. 
Canine Joint Health
 
Osteoarthritis (“OA”) is one of the most common ailments among pet dogs, with prevalence believed to be greater than 20%. The U.S. is expected to hold the largest share of the global market for veterinary pain management due to the vast pet population in the region, increasing animal healthcare expenditure, large number of hospitals and clinics, growing pool of veterinarians, and high prevalence of diseases causing pain. According to IBISWorld, the U.S. veterinary services market showed a solid, steady increase in consumer spending over the past few years.
 
Human Immune Modification
 
Beyond arthritis, there are more than 80 types of clinically different autoimmune diseases. Many major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies have extensive licensing and development programs focused on autoimmune/anti-inflammatory R&D. The rise in strategic alliances by discovery stage R&D companies like ZIVO is one of the latest trends that may gain traction in the autoimmune and anti-inflammatory therapeutics market in the coming years.
Agtech 
 
Human Functional Food Ingredients
 
The market for healthy foods, health foods, vegan and vegetarian food products continues to gain traction in the U.S. and worldwide, especially as consumers look for healthful and nutritional ingredients to improve overall health and immune response. The drive toward plant-based proteins and microbiome-enhancing natural foods and food/beverage ingredients and dietary supplements continues to expand.

6



Joint/Exertion Recovery
 
The market for protein bars, energy drinks, and dietary supplements has been increasing among fitness mavens, bodybuilders and athletes. An increasing number of health & fitness centers has been positively influencing the growth of this market as these centers are involved in the endorsement of sports and fitness nutrition products among their respective consumers. Products may take the form of typical capsules or as mixable powders, beverages, snacks and crisps, many of them vegan or vegetarian. 
 
Poultry Feed Ingredient 
 
Poultry producers combat infectious disease, environmental stressors, feed issues and economic pressures to meet yield, quality and food safety targets not just in the U.S. and EU, but worldwide. In North America, over 66 million metric tons of poultry feed is produced and consumed each year. Medicated feeds with antibiotics, antimicrobials, ionophores, sulfa and copper-based chemicals are under scrutiny, facing consumer pushback. Market and regulatory pressures are encouraging producers to consider non-drug alternatives to keep birds healthy and growing which has created a market for premium “natural” feed ingredients. 
Aquaculture
 
The ingredients used for providing balanced nutrition for aquaculture species are available in the form of pellets, granules, and powders, among others. The aquafeed is primarily sourced from vegetables, grains, oilseeds and the like. The aquafeed industry is fragmented, with the top 5-6 companies accounting for almost 40% of the market share. These companies are targeting countries in most parts of the world for business expansion, either by investing in new production units or acquiring established small players in specific regions. Investment in R&D activities to introduce new and efficient products is another strategy adopted by manufacturers to stay ahead of their competition in the matured markets of North America and Europe.
Clinical Development and Regulatory Pathway
 
Clinical Experience, Future Development and Clinical Trial Plans
 
Our algal biomass product is at different stages of development for different applications. Accordingly, the various regulatory processes required for the various applications are at different stages of completion. With respect to human food and beverage applications, we have completed the Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) self-affirmed GRAS process for our dried algal biomass which allows for product commercialization with a consumption limit of up to nine grams per day. Studies are planned, however, to support a significantly higher allowable daily intake that, if supported, will be justified via the notified GRAS process. For animal feed applications in the European Union, our dried algal biomass product may be now commercialized as a feed material under an existing category for dried algal biomass as listed in the EU Feed Materials Catalogue. 
 
Beyond use of the dried algal biomass for use in human food and beverage in the US, and as an animal feed material in the EU, ZIVO has not received the required approvals for commercialization in the U.S. or any other country for any product form or application beyond nutritional claims. To date, however, the Company has performed a number of bench top and pre-clinical tests (which include animal testing, performance, and other tests required by regulatory bodies) for various product forms and applications pertinent to qualified health claims and structure/function claims. As described below, the Company intends to perform additional testing of its product in connection with obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals.
 
Below we have summarized, for each component of our products under development, the current stage of development, our plans for further testing or clinical trials and our expectations regarding the requirements for regulatory approval and timing of developmental milestones:
 

Product | Stage of Development and/or Regulatory Status to Date | Next Steps 
---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Poultry Gut Health (coccidiosis) | The Company has conducted 16 clinical trials to date. The early studies focused on determining the general effects, while the more recent studies examined dosage levels, interactions with vaccines and different feed mixes. Discovery Stage, pre-good manufacturing practice (GMP), pre-good laboratory practice (GLP) | The Company expects to conduct several more studies on behalf of prospective licensees as part of licensing negotiations, which we estimate will require approximately $1.2 million to complete.


7



Bovine Mastitis | The Company has conducted multiple in vitro and ex vivo experiments to determine general effects, and four clinical trials to focus on product modalities and methods of administration. Discovery Stage, pre-GMP, pre-GLP | The Company expects to conduct three or more small studies to validate a product candidate previously validated in poultry studies, among other similar candidates and to make refinements to same before offering to potential licensees, which we estimate will require approximately $2.0 million to complete over the next two years. This will require future financing, in addition to any proceeds raised in this Offering. 
------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Canine Joint Health | The Company has conducted multiple in vitro inflammatory experiments, followed by two in vivo trials with mice, and two ex vivo experiments using canine hip joint tissue. Discovery Stage, pre-GMP, pre-GLP | Two additional ex vivo experiments are necessary to gauge effectiveness of product candidate, to be followed by two in vivo studies to determine dosage and tolerance, likely followed by one or more validation studies on behalf of prospective licensees. We estimate this will require approximately $1.7 million to complete over the next two years. This will require future financing, in addition to any proceeds raised in this Offering.
Human Immune Modulation | The Company has conducted six in vitro experiments using human immune cells attenuated by proprietary TLR4 inhibitor. | The Company has additional testing planned, beginning with repeated in vitro testing of different dosages and purities. 
Algal biomass for human consumption | The Company has established self-affirmed GRAS status (12 November 2018). No clinical testing is required for commercialization. | Commercial launch is in process. Product can be marketed immediately. Additional studies are planned to be conducted to expand the allowable daily intake (ADI) and obtain an FDA No Objection letter. We estimate that the additional studies will require approximately $600,000, and an additional $530,000 for inoculum production and cell banking. 
Algal biomass for animal feed | The product is covered as a feed material under an existing category for dried algal biomass listed in the EU Feed Materials Catalogue No clinical testing is required for commercialization in the EU. | Commercial launch pending regulatory approval in the EU. We estimate this will require approximately $400,000, which includes EU compliance costs. 
Biomass for supporting skin health / anti-aging | The Company is researching and designing several investigations to establish definitive support for the mechanism of action associated with skin health / anti-aging. Support for the indication is a prerequisite to the human new dietary ingredient (NDI) application. The Company has evaluated algal biomass and algal supernatant samples for the presence of TLR4 inhibitor. | The Company is planning additional studies to support skin health/anti-aging. This will require future financing, in addition to any proceeds raised in this Offering. Pending the outcome of these tests, we expect to notify the Food and Drug Administration about these ingredients and our intent to market according to Section 413(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 350b(d). 
Animal functional feed ingredient | Multiple product configurations are being evaluated in studies designed to validate efficacy. The regulatory pathway required will be dictated by the product configuration(s) selected for commercial development and the associated claims to be made. Potential regulatory pathways include GRAS per FDA guidance, INAD/NADA through the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), or approval as an immune modulating product through the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB). | Species-specific in vivo safety studies will be performed for each product configuration to be commercialized. Formal product stability studies under ambient and accelerated conditions will also be performed. The GRAS compliance effort is budgeted at $450,000.

Material Agreements
 
Zoetis Collaboration/Option Agreement 
 
On December 20, 2013, the Company entered into a collaboration, confidentiality and option agreement with Zoetis (as amended from time to time, the “Zoetis Agreement”), formerly Pfizer Animal Health, and the world’s largest animal health company, pursuant to which the Company is conducting bovine mastitis research. Pursuant to the Zoetis Agreement, the Company is conducting a validation under the supervision of Zoetis principals, the results of which will form the basis for an evaluation by Zoetis of ZIVO’s product candidates. 

9



Under the Zoetis Agreement, the Company granted Zoetis an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive license with the Company for Company proprietary technology, including its identified and characterized natural molecule and its synthetic fatty acid/polysaccharide complex, and derivatives/homologs/isomers thereof, and production of the same (the “Technology”). The Company is required to execute a study under the supervision of Zoetis, the results of which will be used by Zoetis to evaluate whether or not to exercise its option. Within 90 days of its receipt of results, Zoetis must notify the Company whether or not it wishes to secure an exclusive license, and the negotiation of such license and payment terms will be made at that time.
 
The Zoetis Agreement has been extended through six amendments, with the current term set to expire on September 26, 2021. As of September 30, 2020, the Company is in the last phase of its bovine mastitis research program, including identification and structural analysis of bioactive compounds. Upon delivery of program results, Zoetis has ninety days to either offer an option payment, enter into a licensing agreement, acquire the IP or, if Zoetis does none of the foregoing, ZIVO has the right to approach other pharmaceutical companies.
 
NutriQuest Collaborative Marketing Agreement
 
In April 2017, the Company entered into a limited license agreement with animal nutrition innovator NutriQuest (the “NutriQuest Agreement”), which holds feed formulation contracts with Tyson, Purdue, Smithfield and other large poultry and pork processors around the world. Poultry feed testing has shown that the Company’s proprietary algal strain may be a natural immune modulator that may enter the market as a natural product or phytogenic feed ingredient, providing the No Antibiotics Ever (“NAE”) producers with a non-medicated feed alternative. 
 
Under the NutriQuest Agreement, ZIVO granted to NutriQuest a limited, exclusive license to market, distribute sell and collect the sales proceeds in all ZIVO's nutrition, feed additive and supplementation applications naturally-derived algal biomass and extraction products (collectively the "Products") for oral administration in poultry and swine. The Products will be sold under the NutriQuest brand, with logos and packaging chosen by NutriQuest, with NutriQuest marketing, distributing and collecting revenues from sales of the Products. The parties will equally share the gross profit.
 
Additionally, if ZIVO licenses its intellectual property to another party in the animal nutrition market (a “Competitive Product”), NutriQuest has the right to exercise either of the following two options: 
 
·
Market Adjustment Option: ZIVO shall pay NutriQuest a market adjustment that is equal to 15% of the gross profit earned by ZIVO on the Competitive Product; and 
 
·
Put Option: NutriQuest has an option to terminate the NutriQuest Agreement and require ZIVO to pay NutriQuest a termination fee equal to three times NutriQuest’s 50% portion of the highest annualized gross profit achieved by NutriQuest in any 12 consecutive month period since inception of sales pursuant to the NutriQuest Agreement. 
NutriChipz Supply Agreement
 
In June 2018, ZIVO entered into an exclusive US-only supply agreement with NutriChipz (the “NutriChipz Agreement”), which provides an exclusive license to NutriChipz to supply our algae as an ingredient in chips and crisps. Under the NutriChipz Agreement, Nutrichipz will pay ZIVO an amount equal to 130% of the direct cost of ZIVO algal biomass at a U.S. port of entry; provided, however, that such cost shall not exceed $15,000 per metric ton. 
 
The NutriChipz Agreement has a term of five years, subject to up to two additional two-year terms at the election of NutriChipz. However, if at any point after the date that is 12 months following the first delivery by ZIVO of two tons of its product to Nutrichipz at an average price per ton of no more than $8,000, Nutrichipz fails to purchase at monthly cumulative average of at least 10 tons of product, then ZIVO will be released from the exclusivity obligations. Additionally, either party may terminate the NutriChipz Agreement if the other party breaches the Nutrichipz Agreement, and does not cure such breach within 90 days, or upon certain insolvency, bankruptcy events of the other party.

Protection of our IP is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets as well as nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, material transfer agreements, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our IP and other proprietary rights.
 
Patents
 
The term of individual patents and patent applications will depend upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application (or parent application, if applicable). For example, if an international Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application is filed, any patent issuing from the PCT application in a specific country expires 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application. In the United States, using the Paris Convention route, if a patent was in force on June 8, 1995, or issued on an application that was filed before June 8, 1995, that patent will have a term that is the greater of 20 years from the filing date, or 17 years from the date of issue.
 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug, biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension (“PTE”). PTE permits restoration of a portion of the patent term of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process if approval of the application for the product is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug or biological product containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug (IND) and the submission date of a biological license application (“BLA”) plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE for only one patent applicable to an approved drug, and the maximum period of restoration is five years beyond the expiration of the patent. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and a patent can only be extended once, and thus, even if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions may be available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for PTEs for patents covering our therapeutic candidates and products and their methods of use.
 
Trade Secrets
 
We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect such IP and proprietary information by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement as the case may be. Our agreements with our employees prohibit them from providing us with any IP or proprietary information of third parties. We also generally require confidentiality agreements or material transfer agreements with third parties that receive or have access to our confidential information, data or other materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our employees and third parties that have access to our confidential proprietary information will abide by the terms of their agreements. Despite the measures that we take to protect our IP and confidential information, unauthorized third parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information.
Government Regulation
 
Overview
 
Biotech
 
As a discovery-stage licensor, we do not intend to fund and oversee the final regulatory approvals and commercialization processes of our product candidates, as we expect these to be borne by the licensee in all cases. 
Agtech
 
As the licensor of food technology, and producer of culture inoculum for cultivation, ZIVO and its licensed growers must furnish to customers algal biomass that is compliant with all food and feed standards and regulations of the FDA, CVM, USDA, and the Association of American Feed Control Officials (“AAFCO”) regulations.
 
In all cases, the compliance efforts involve GRAS affirmation and an FDA “No Objection” letter for each target specie. ZIVO has already obtained GRAS affirmation for human use.
 
The Company intends to monetize IP via licensing and biomass sales to feed and food marketers, dietary supplement makers and pharmaceutical companies. In so doing, each individual application requires testing and validation of safety and efficacy, per established regulation. Market verticals and compliance standards are closely associated. It stands to reason that entering a particular vertical is based on the economic opportunity, tempered by the cost and complexity of complying with all relevant standards.

15



Feed Ingredients – Livestock and Poultry
 
Feed ingredients in the U.S. are nominally controlled by the AAFCO, under a working memorandum with the FDA, which provides enforcement and litigation on behalf of AAFCO. Recent actions by the FDA and CVM have complicated the compliance process, and in February 2018, Company principals engaged Tox Strategies, Inc. as compliance consultants for poultry GRAS self-affirmation. 
 
Because animal products make up a critical part of the food supply, anything that goes into dairy cows, beef cattle, pork or poultry is heavily regulated. In this instance, the Company intends to sell its dried algal biomass or extracts as a feed ingredient. It is incumbent upon the Company to prove that its algal culture is safe to consume by humans and provides nutritional value to the animal. No claims can be made regarding any of its beneficial properties beyond digestibility, nutrition and productivity.
 
In March 2019, ZIVO retained Pen & Tec Consulting Group, an animal feed compliance consultancy based in Portugal to assist in EU product registration. ZIVO dried algal biomass has since been classified as a feed material in the EU, requiring no new research or study, but a rather time-consuming process of product registration and importation protocols which is still in process as of December 31, 2020.
 
Feed Ingredients & Supplements – Companion Animals
 
Although state AAFCO officials still regulate companion animal feeds, treats and supplements, the supervision and standards are largely handled by the FDA and the CVM on a national level. However, the standards are not as restrictive as livestock feed. We currently do not have approval to sell companion animal feeds and are in the process of developing the specie-specific safety and health data required to do so. Companion animal products are aimed primarily at dogs and horses. We believe that a single safety/tox study and a separate dose/benefit study per animal applications will be sufficient. As with humans, we would seek to obtain a GRAS affirmation. 
 
To clarify, an “application” is a single ingredient in a single formulation and a single claim for a single animal species. Therefore, a dietary supplement with the Company’s active compound, intended as a joint health supplement for adult dogs, constitutes a single application. That single application requires its own studies before any dog treat manufacturer would consider licensing or purchasing the Company’s active compounds. Any change to the claims (more energy, shinier coat, etc.) or the target specie requires a new study. This is the current state of regulation, and it holds true for all human and animal applications.
 
Food Ingredient – Human
 
The food ingredient industry is regulated by several federal agencies. Anything that is introduced into food or beverages, whether to prevent spoilage, optimize processing or to enhance its nutritive value, must meet standards set and enforced rigorously by the FDA and USDA.
GRAS
 
The FDA requires that ingredients introduced into human foods and beverages are safe and are manufactured in a consistent manner that guarantees consumer safety. The standard that the Company must meet for food ingredient safety is GRAS. The Company opted to conduct a self-certification of its algal biomass and extracts, to be followed by an FDA “No Objection” letter and formal product registration.
 
In 2016, ZIVO contracted Burdock Group Consultants to assist the Company in the compliance process, and to help with the process with the FDA. Further, the Company retained the New York law firm of Ullman Shapiro Ullman LLP, now part of Rivkin-Radler LLP, to advise in the compliance process.
 
ZIVO obtained GRAS affirmed status for its dried algal biomass in November 2018, which allowed for immediate sale of biomass in the U.S. market as a food or beverage agreement at an ADI of 10 grams. However, ZIVO principals are aiming for a much higher threshold, approximately 50 times the average ADI for all other microalgae. 
 
This will require a human tolerance study of 45 days’ duration and result in a new GRAS self-affirmation at the higher ADI. At that point, ZIVO principals will apply for an FDA “No Objection” letter, product registration as a food/beverage ingredient and immediately begin the NDI application process.

16



Current Good Manufacturing Process
 
The other standard that must be met is current Good Manufacturing Process (“cGMP”) before any ingredient can be introduced into foods and beverages. This requires a formal notification to the FDA in parallel with GRAS or NDI applications and usually invites a visit from the FDA to review the manufacturing/production process. The Company must present process statements and documentation that follow cGMP standards to ensure the consistency of its product. 
 
Further, the FDA also requires federal licensing of all food and supplement processing facilities, in addition to any state and local licensing and inspections, should the product be produced in the U.S. If produced overseas, the FDA, USDA and U.S. Customs require that each grower is enrolled in the Foreign Supplier Verification Program, a cost to be borne by the grower and ZIVO.
 
Dietary Supplements
 
Dietary supplements, which include vitamins, minerals, nutritive substances and natural products that are standalone products (“nutraceuticals”) fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA and must comply with the Dietary Supplement Health Education Act (“DSHEA”) legislation passed in 1994 and updated several times since, along with the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011.
 
NDI Application
 
As human dietary supplement applications are being readied for market launch, the Company is required to file an NDI application. As part of the application process, ZIVO must conduct at least one human study, and possibly two. These studies can run concurrently but should not be conducted by the same clinical research organization. To date, ZIVO has not run these studies. One such study is the dose tolerance study used to amend the GRAS filing, and can be repurposed for this application. Therefore, Company principals expect that once acceptable algal biomass is available from its contract growers, the NDI approvals should not exceed 120 days’ duration after the completed studies and application are filed. 
 
Structure/Function Claims
 
The Company can go to market (once a single study has been completed and Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) protocols are in evidence) with simple structure/function claims regarding the ability to maintain a healthy immune response or a beneficial anti-inflammatory response. This is the most basic of FDA standards and essentially means that as long as GMP standards are met, a study has been conducted and that in-process toxicology reports are available, the Company is able to market its product.
 
The market reality is that nutraceutical and supplement makers won’t take on the product unless its chemical makeup is generally described, the plant or animal is properly classified (in this case, algae) and the manufacturing process is free of health hazards and that GMP protocols are observed, all of which the Company intends to meet or exceed.
 
USP Certification
 
The DSHEA regulations also require that a safe dosage is established for any vitamin, mineral or dietary supplement, whether it is natural or synthetic in composition. The United States Pharmacopeia (“USP”) is the official pharmacopeia of the United States. USP establishes written (documentary) and physical (reference) standards for medicines, food ingredients, dietary supplement products and ingredients. 
 
These standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help to ensure that these products are of the appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity, and consistency. The Company will endeavor to adhere to the most basic USP standard in order to maintain speed to market. It or its licensees will then consider the USP Verified products designation.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
The Company may be subject to various claims, complaints, and legal actions that arise from time to time in the normal course of business. Management does not believe that the Company is party to any currently pending material legal proceedings as of February 25, 2021. There can be no assurance that existing or future legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We believe that we are, in all material respects, in compliance with local, state, and federal environmental laws applicable to our production and waste disposal. The cost of this compliance activity to date has not been material and has been absorbed within our general operations overhead.
