 Item 1. Business
 Organization
 Sotherly Hotels Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-managed and self-administered lodging real estate investment trust, or REIT, that was formed in August 2004 to own, acquire, renovate and reposition full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in primary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. On December 21, 2004, the Company successfully completed its initial public offering and elected to be treated as a self-advised REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Company conducts its business through Sotherly Hotels LP, its operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), of which the Company is the general partner. As of the filing date, the Company owns approximately 92.8% of the partnership units in the Operating Partnership. Limited partners own the remaining Operating Partnership units.
 As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of twelve full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels located in eight states with an aggregate total of 3,156 rooms, as well as interests in two condominium hotels and their associated rental programs.  All of our hotels are wholly-owned by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, and all are managed on a day-to-day basis by Our Town Hospitality, LLC (“Our Town”). 
 In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, it cannot directly manage or operate our wholly-owned hotels. Therefore, we lease our wholly-owned hotel properties to entities that we refer to as our “TRS Lessees”, which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. (“MHI Holding”, and collectively with the TRS Lessees, the “MHI TRS Entities”).  The MHI TRS Entities, in turn, have engaged Our Town, which is an eligible independent management company, to manage the day-to-day operations at our hotels.  MHI Holding is a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) for federal income tax purposes.
 Our corporate office is located at 306 South Henry Street, Suite 100, Williamsburg, Virginia 23185. Our telephone number is (757) 229-5648.
 COVID-19, Management’s Plans and Liquidity
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) to be a global pandemic and the virus has continued to spread throughout the United States and the world. As a result of this pandemic and subsequent government mandates and official health recommendations to the public, hotel demand has been significantly reduced. Following the government mandates and official health recommendations, we significantly reduced operations at all our hotels, temporarily suspended operations of our hotel condominium rental programs and dramatically reduced staffing and expenses. All our hotels other than the rental programs at our condominium hotels, which were temporarily closed during April and May, have remained open on a limited basis in order to serve the needs of the community. We expect that maintaining limited operations will allow us to increase capacity at individual hotels as demand returns and the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) and state guidelines allow for an easing and eventual elimination of travel and other business restrictions, provided we can be confident that occupancy levels and reduced social distancing will not unduly jeopardize the health and safety of our guests, employees and communities.
 COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results, including a substantial decline in our revenues, profitability and cash flows from operations on a year-over-year basis.  While the duration and full extent of the reduction in hotel demand caused by the pandemic, the contraction of operations at our hotels and other effects are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, we expect significant negative impacts on our operations and financial results to continue until travel and business restrictions are eased, travel orders are lifted, consumer confidence is restored and there is a substantial recovery in the economy. At a minimum, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow through 2021.
 In response to those negative impacts, we immediately took a number of actions to reduce costs and preserve liquidity.  The Company’s board of directors suspended quarterly cash dividends on shares of the Company’s common stock and deferred payment of dividends on its 8.0% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), 7.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), and 8.25% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series D Preferred Stock”). We also suspended most planned capital expenditure projects, and reduced the compensation of our executive officers, board of directors and employees.  Working closely with our hotel managers, we significantly reduced our hotels’ operating expenses.
 The COVID-19 pandemic also significantly increased economic uncertainty and led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which has limited our access to capital and could increase our cost of capital. As a result of the negative impacts of the pandemic and the ongoing market uncertainty, in April and May 2020, three of our wholly-owned subsidiaries sought and received funding under the federal Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) provided in Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act of 1953, as 
 6


amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, as amended (the “CARES Act”).  Pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements and promissory notes entered into with lenders under the PPP, we borrowed an aggregate amount of approximately $10.7 million (the “PPP Loans”).
 
We also sought and obtained forbearance and loan modification agreements with lenders under the mortgages for certain of our hotel properties. As of December 31, 2020, we failed to make nine consecutive monthly payments of principal and interest under the mortgage secured by our DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach hotel, which constituted an Event of Default, and which, pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan agreement, may cause an increase in the interest rate on the outstanding loan balance for the period during which such Event of Default persists.  Following an Event of Default, our lenders (including the lender under our DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach mortgage) can generally elect to accelerate all principal and accrued interest payments that remain outstanding under the applicable mortgage loan and foreclose on the applicable hotel properties that are security for such loans.  If the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach mortgage lender were to accelerate the payment of principal and interest on the applicable mortgage, we would likely not have or be able to raise sufficient funds to pay that mortgage debt. In addition, we failed to meet the financial covenants under the mortgage agreement which triggered a “cash trap” requiring substantially all the revenue generated by our hotel to be deposited directly into a lockbox account and swept into cash management accounts for the benefit of the lender.  We are currently negotiating an amendment to that loan agreement and have not received a Notice of Default.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we failed to meet the financial covenants under the mortgages secured by each of the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport, the Hotel Alba, the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel, and The Whitehall.  We have received waivers of the financial covenants under the applicable mortgages from (i) the lender on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport through March 31, 2021; (ii) the lender on the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel as of December 31, 2020; (iii) the lender on the Hotel Alba mortgage through December 31, 2020, provided that we maintain the cash collateral on deposit with the lender; and (iv) the lender on The Whitehall mortgage through September 30, 2021. Cash collateral on deposit with the Hotel Alba lender was approximately $1.9 million as of December 31, 2020.  
 
As of December 31, 2020, we failed to meet the financial covenants under the mortgage secured by the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront and the Georgian Terrace, which triggered a “cash trap” under the loan documents relating to each of these properties requiring substantially all the profit generated by those hotels to be deposited directly into lockbox accounts and swept into cash management accounts for the benefit of the respective lenders until each property meets the criteria in the relevant loan agreement for exiting the “cash trap”.  In addition, in order to receive forbearance from the lenders on the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone – University and the Hyatt Centric Arlington, we agreed to “cash traps” until the properties meet the criteria in the forbearance agreements for exiting the “cash traps”.
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $25.3 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $10.0 million in restricted cash.  In addition, we have the option to obtain $10.0 million in additional proceeds from the sale of additional Secured Notes to the Investors as described below.
 
While the duration and extent of the reduction in hotel demand caused by the pandemic creates corresponding uncertainty regarding our future cash flows, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations for operating expenses, planned capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest – including scheduled repayments of deferred principal and interest on our mortgage debt.  However, the Company believes it is probable that over the course of the next four to six quarters it may fail to satisfy financial covenants in the above-described loans.  If the Company fails to obtain the requisite waivers, our lenders could declare it in default and require repayment of the outstanding balances on the relevant loans.  If that were to occur, the Company may not have sufficient funds to pay the applicable debt.  While the Company believes we will be successful in obtaining waivers, forbearance arrangements and loan modifications, it cannot provide assurance that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel matures in August 2021.  Given the underperformance of the hotel due to the pandemic, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to modify, extend, renew or refinance the existing indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.  
 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires that when preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, management has the responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.  Due to the uncertainties described above related to the financial covenants and maturities under our mortgage loans, and the Company’s ability to meet its contractual obligation to repay those loans, if accelerated or when due, the Company determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Secured Note Financing
 On December 31, 2020, we closed a transaction with KWHP SOHO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“KW”), as collateral agent and an investor, and MIG SOHO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MIG”, and together with KW, the “Investors”), as an investor, whereby the Investors purchased $20.0 million in Secured Notes from the Operating Partnership with an option to require the Investors to purchase an additional $10.0 million in Secured Notes.  We entered into the following agreements: (i) a Note Purchase Agreement; (ii) a Senior Secured Note with KW in the amount of $10.0 million and a Senior Secured Note with MIG in the amount of $10.0 million (collectively, the “Secured Notes”); (iii) a Pledge and Security Agreement; (iv) a Board Observer Agreement; and (v) other related ancillary agreements.  The Secured Notes mature in 3 years and will be payable on or before the maturity date at the rate of 1.47x the principal amount borrowed during the initial 3-year term, with a 1-year extension at Company’s option.  The Secured Notes also carry a 6.0% current interest rate, payable quarterly during the initial 3-year term.  Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership entered into the Pledge Agreement with KW, pursuant to which we agreed to pledge and grant to KW a first priority security interest in the equity interests, including certain voting rights, of our affiliates that own The DeSoto hotel, Hotel Ballast Wilmington, and the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport hotel (collectively, the “Pledged Collateral”).  Upon an uncured monetary event of default under the Secured Notes, KW, as collateral agent, has a right to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of or realize upon the Pledged Collateral in order to satisfy any amounts outstanding under the Secured Notes.  Pursuant to the Board Observer Agreement, the Company granted KW the option and the right, while the Secured Notes remain outstanding, to appoint a single representative to attend meetings of the Company’s board of directors and its committees in a non-voting, observer capacity only.
Our Properties
 As of December 31, 2020, our hotels were located in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.  Nine of these hotels operate under franchise agreements with major hotel brands, and three are independent hotels.  We also own the hotel commercial condominium units of the Hyde Resort & Residences and Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences condominium hotels.  See Items 2 and 7 of this Form 10-K for additional detail on our properties.
Our Strategy and Investment Criteria
 Our strategy is to grow through acquisitions of full-service, upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in the primary markets of the southern United States. We intend to grow our portfolio through disciplined acquisitions of hotel properties and believe that we will be able to source significant external growth opportunities through our management team’s extensive network of industry, corporate and institutional relationships.  Current market conditions and the terms of our loan agreements limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy, but as economic conditions improve and demand and consumer confidence increase, we intend to position the Company to execute on our growth strategy.
 Our investment criteria are further detailed below:
  
• | Geographic Growth Markets: Our growth strategy focuses on the major markets in the Southern region of the United States. Our management team remains confident in the long-term growth potential associated with this part of the United States. We believe these markets have, during the Company’s and our predecessors’ existence, been characterized by population growth, economic expansion, growth in new businesses and growth in the resort, recreation and leisure segments. We will continue to focus on these markets, including coastal locations, and will investigate other markets for acquisitions only if we believe these new markets will provide similar long-term growth prospects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Full-Service Hotels: Our acquisition strategy focuses on the full-service hotel segment. Our full-service hotels fall primarily under the upscale to upper-upscale categories and include such brands as Hilton, Doubletree by Hilton, Sheraton and Hyatt, as well as independent hotels affiliated with Preferred Hotels & Resorts. We may also acquire commercial unit(s) within upscale to upper-upscale condominium hotel projects, allowing us to establish and operate unit rental programs. We do not own economy hotels. We believe that full-service hotels, in the upscale to upper-upscale categories, will outperform the broader U.S. hotel industry, and thus offer the highest returns on invested capital. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant Barriers to Entry: We intend to execute a strategy that entails the acquisition of hotels in prime locations with significant barriers to entry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proximity to Demand Generators: We seek to acquire hotel properties located in central business districts for both leisure and business travelers within the respective markets, including large state universities, airports, convention centers, corporate headquarters, sports venues and office buildings. We seek to be in walking locations that are proximate to the markets’ major demand generators.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We generally have a bias toward acquiring underperforming hotels, which we typically define as those that are poorly managed, suffer from significant deferred maintenance and capital investment and that are not properly positioned in their respective markets. In 
 8


pursuing these opportunities, we hope to improve revenue and cash flow and increase the long-term value of the underperforming hotels we acquire. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a total investment that is substantially less than replacement cost of a hotel or the acquisition cost of a market performing hotel. In analyzing a potential investment in an underperforming hotel property, we typically characterize the investment opportunity as one of the following:
  
• | Branding Opportunity: The acquisition of properties that includes a repositioning of the property through a change in brand affiliation, which may include positioning the property as an independent hotel. Branding opportunities typically include physical upgrades and enhanced efficiencies brought about by changes in operations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shallow-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of an underperforming but structurally sound hotel that requires moderate renovation to re-establish the hotel in its market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deep-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of a hotel that is closed or functionally obsolete and requires a restructuring of both the business components of the operations as well as the physical plant of the hotel, including extensive renovation of the building, furniture, fixtures and equipment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Typically, in our experience, a deep turn opportunity takes a total of approximately four years from the initial acquisition of a property to achieving full post-renovation stabilization. Therefore, when evaluating future opportunities in underperforming hotels, we intend to focus on up-branding and shallow-turn opportunities, and to pursue deep-turn opportunities on a more limited basis and in joint venture partnerships, if possible.
 Investment Vehicles. In pursuit of our investment strategy, we may employ various traditional and non-traditional investment vehicles:
  
• | Direct Purchase Opportunity: Our traditional investment strategy is to acquire direct ownership interests via our Operating Partnership in properties that meet our investment criteria, including opportunities that involve full-service, upscale and upper-upscale properties in identified geographic growth markets that have significant barriers to entry for new product delivery. Such properties, or portfolio of properties, may or may not be acquired subject to a mortgage, or other financing or lending instruments, by the seller or third-party.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Joint Venture/Mezzanine Lending Opportunities: We may, from time to time, undertake a significant renovation and rehabilitation project that we characterize as a deep-turn opportunity. In such cases, we may acquire a functionally obsolete hotel whose renovation may be very lengthy and require significant capital. In these projects, we may choose to structure such acquisitions as a joint venture, or mezzanine lending program, in order to avoid severe short-term dilution and loss of current income commonly referred to as the “negative carry” associated with such extensive renovation programs. We will not pursue joint venture or mezzanine programs in which we would become a “de facto” lender to the real estate community.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portfolio and Asset Management Strategy
 We intend to ensure that the management of our hotel properties maximizes market share, as evidenced by revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) penetration indices, and that our market share yields the optimum level of revenues for our hotels in their respective markets. Our strategy is designed to actively monitor our hotels’ operating expenses in an effort to maximize hotel earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Hotel EBITDA”).
 Over our long history in the lodging industry, we have refined many portfolio and asset management techniques that we believe provide for exceptional cash returns at our hotels. We undertake extensive budgeting due diligence wherein we examine market trends, one-time or exceptional revenue opportunities, and/or changes in the regulatory climate that may impact costs. We review daily revenue results and revenue management strategies at the hotels, and we focus on our managers’ ability to produce high quality revenues that translate to higher profit margins. We look for ancillary forms of revenues, such as leasing roof-top space for cellular towers and other communication devices and also look to lease space to third parties in our hotels, which may include, but are not limited to, gift shops or restaurants. We have and will continue to engage parking management companies to maximize parking revenue. Our efforts further include periodic review of property insurance costs and coverage, and the cost of real and personal property taxes. We generally appeal tax increases in an effort to secure lower tax payments and routinely pursue strategies that allow for lower overall insurance costs, such as purchasing re-insurance.
 We also require detailed and refined reporting data from our hotel managers, which includes detailed accounts of revenues, revenue segments, expenses and forecasts based on current and historic booking patterns. We also believe we optimize and successfully manage capital costs at our hotels while ensuring that adequate product standards are maintained to provide a positive guest experience.

None of our hotels are managed by a major national or global hotel franchise company.  Through our long history in the lodging industry, we have found that management of our hotels by management companies other than franchisors is preferable to and more profitable than management services provided by the major franchise companies, specifically with respect to optimization of operating expenses and the delivery of guest service.
 Our portfolio management strategy includes efforts to optimize labor costs. Our third-party hotel managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our hotels, we monitor our hotel managers and make recommendations regarding the operation of our hotels.  The labor force in our hotels is predominately non-unionized, with only one property, the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, having approximately 31 employees electing to participate under a collective bargaining arrangement. Further, the employees at our hotels that are managed by Our Town are eligible to receive health and other insurance coverage through Our Town, which self-insures. Self-insuring has, in our opinion and experience, provided significant savings over traditional insurance company sponsored plans.
 Asset Disposition Strategy. When a property no longer fits with our investment objectives, we will pursue a direct sale of the property for cash so that our investment capital can be redeployed according to the investment strategies outlined above. Where possible, we will seek to subsequently purchase a hotel in connection with the requirements of a tax-free exchange. Such a strategy may be deployed in order to mitigate the tax consequence that a direct sale may cause.

 Agreements with Our Town.  Our Town is the management company for each of our twelve wholly-owned hotels, as well as the manager for our two condominium rental programs.  Our Town is a majority-owned subsidiary of Newport Hospitality Group, Inc (“Newport”).  As of December 31, 2020, Andrew M. Sims, our Chairman, and David R. Folsom, our President and Chief Executive Officer beneficially owned approximately 19.5% and 2.5%, respectively, of the total outstanding ownership interests of Our Town.  Both Mr. Sims and Mr. Folsom serve as directors of Our Town.
 On September 6, 2019, we entered into a master agreement with Newport and Our Town related to the management of certain of our hotels.  On December 13, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the master agreement (as amended, the “OTH Master Agreement”), as well as a series of individual hotel management agreements for the management of those ten hotels.  On April 1, 2020, Our Town became the manager for our DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach hotel, as well as the manager of our rental programs at the Hyde Resort & Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences.  On November 15, 2020, Our Town became the manager of our Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel.  The hotel management agreements for our 12 wholly-owned hotels 
 10


and the two rental programs are referred to as an “OTH Hotel Management Agreement” and, together, the “OTH Hotel Management Agreements”.
 The OTH Master Agreement:
  
• | expires on March 31, 2025, or earlier if all of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements expire or are terminated prior to that date. The OTH Master Agreement shall be extended beyond 2025 for such additional periods as an OTH Hotel Management Agreement remains in effect; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requires Our Town to provide dedicated executive level support for our managed hotels pursuant to certain criteria;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sets an incentive management fee for each of the hotels managed by Our Town equal to 10% of the amount by which gross operating profit, as defined in the OTH Hotel Management Agreements, for a given year exceeds the budgeted gross operating profit for such year; provided, however, that the incentive management fee payable in respect of any such year shall not exceed 0.25% of the gross revenues of the hotel included in such calculation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provides for an adjustment to the fees payable by us under the OTH Hotel Management Agreements in the event the net operating income of Our Town falls below $250,000 for any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2021;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provides a mechanism and establishes conditions on which the Company will offer Our Town the opportunity to manage hotels acquired by the Company in the future, pursuant to a negotiated form of single facility management agreement, with the caveat that the Company is not required to offer the management of future hotels to Our Town; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sets a base management fee for future hotels of 2.00% for the first year of the term, 2.25% for the second year of the term, and 2.50% for the third and any additional years of the term.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements has an initial term ending March 31, 2025.  Each of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements may be extended for up to two additional periods of five years subject to the approval of both parties with respect to any such extension.  The agreements provide that Our Town will be the sole and exclusive manager of the hotels as the agent of the respective TRS Lessee, at the sole cost and expense of the TRS Lessee (except for the initial advances and amounts borrowed by Our Town under the Credit Agreement as described below), and subject to certain operating standards.  Each agreement may be terminated in connection with a sale of the related hotel.  In connection with a termination upon the sale of the hotel, Our Town will be entitled to receive a termination fee equal to the lesser of the management fee paid with respect to the prior twelve months or the management fees paid for that number of months prior to the closing date of the hotel sale equal to the number of months remaining on the current term of the OTH Hotel Management Agreement.  Upon the sale of a hotel, no termination fee will be due in the event the Company elects to provide Our Town with the opportunity to manage another comparable hotel and Our Town is not precluded from accepting such opportunity.  Our Town is required to qualify as an eligible independent contractor in order to permit the Company to continue to operate as a real estate investment trust.
 Pursuant to the management agreements for the Hyde Resort & Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences, Our Town manages the rental of individually owned condominium units pursuant to rental agreements entered into with individual condominium unit owners.  We have also entered into an Association Sub Management and Assignment Agreement with Our Town for the management and operation of the condominium association responsible for the operation of the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences, and a Rental Sales Management Agreement pursuant to which Our Town agreed to manage the marketing and negotiation of rental agreements with individual condominium unit owners.
 Terminated Agreements with Chesapeake Hospitality.  Prior to April 1, 2020, MHI Hotels Services, LLC, which does business as Chesapeake Hospitality (“Chesapeake Hospitality”), was the manager for our DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach hotel, as well as the manager for our rental programs at the Hyde Resort & Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences.  Prior to January 1, 2020, Chesapeake Hospitality was the manager for eleven of our twelve wholly-owned hotels, as well as the manager of the two condominium rental programs.  Effective April 1, 2020, Chesapeake no longer serves as the manager for any of our properties and management of the remaining properties that had been managed by Chesapeake was transitioned to Our Town as described above.
 Terminated Management Agreement with Highgate Hotels.  Prior to November 15, 2020, Highgate Hotels, L.P. (“Highgate Hotels”) was the manager for our Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel.  Effective November 15, 2020, the Hyatt Centric Arlington Hotel is managed by Our Town as described above.
Franchise Agreements
 As of December 31, 2020, all but three of our wholly-owned hotels operate under franchise licenses from national hotel companies.  As our franchise agreements expire, we will continue to evaluate each hotel on a case-by-case basis and decide whether to 
 11


renew or terminate the agreement.  We also periodically review our independent hotels to determine whether they would be better served by operating under a franchise license.
 Our TRS Lessees hold the franchise licenses for our wholly-owned hotels. Our hotel managers must operate each of our hotels they manage in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement for the hotel.
 The franchise licenses generally specify certain management, operational, record keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchisee must comply. Under the franchise licenses, the franchisee must comply with the franchisors’ standards and requirements with respect to:
  
• | training of operational personnel;
--+-----------------------------------


• | safety;
--+--------


• | maintaining specified insurance;
--+---------------------------------


• | the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | display of signage;
--+--------------------


• | marketing standards including print media, billboards, and promotions standards; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As the franchisee, our TRS Lessees are required to pay franchise/royalty fees, as well as certain other fees for marketing and reservations services in amounts that range from approximately 3.0% to 4.0% of gross revenues.  The following table sets forth certain information for the franchise licenses of our wholly-owned hotel properties as of December 31, 2020:

 Lease Agreements
 TRS Leases
 In order for the Company to maintain qualification as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries can operate our hotels directly. Our wholly-owned hotels are leased to our TRS Lessees, which have engaged a third-party management company to manage the hotels. Each lease has a non-cancelable term of four to thirty years, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain contingencies described in the lease.
 During the term of each lease, our TRS Lessees are obligated to pay a fixed annual base rent plus a percentage rent and certain other additional charges. Base rent accrues and is paid monthly. Percentage rent is calculated by multiplying fixed percentages by gross room revenues, in excess of certain threshold amounts and is paid monthly or quarterly, according to the terms of the agreement.
 Other Leases
 We lease the land underlying the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel pursuant to a ground lease.  The ground lease requires us to make rental payments of $50,000 per year in base rent and percentage rent equal to 3.5% of gross room revenue in excess of certain thresholds, as defined in the ground lease agreement.  The ground lease contains a rent reset provision that will reset the rent in June 2025 to a fixed amount per annum equal to 8.0% of the land value, subject to an appraisal process.  The initial term of the ground lease expires in 2035 and may be extended by us for four additional renewal periods of 10 years each.  The ground lease requires us to

obtain the consent of the third-party lessor in order to sell the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel or to assign our leasehold interest in the ground lease.
 In connection with the acquisition of the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences hotel commercial condominium unit, we entered into a 20-year parking and cabana management agreement for the parking garage and poolside cabanas associated with the resort.  In exchange for rights to the parking and cabana revenue, we pay the condominium association an annual payment of $271,000 per annum for the initial five-year term, with 5.0% increases on every fifth year of the term.
 We lease approximately 8,500 square feet of commercial office space in Williamsburg, Virginia for our corporate offices, under an agreement with a ten-year term beginning January 1, 2020.  The initial annual rent under the agreement is $218,875, with the rent for each successive annual period increasing by 3.0% over the prior annual period’s rent.  The annual rent is offset by a tenant improvement allowance of $200,000, applied against one-half of each monthly rent payment until such time as the tenant improvement allowance is exhausted.
 Tax Status
 The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004. In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute, as “qualifying distributions,” at least 90.0% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding its net capital gains and reduced by certain non-cash items) to its stockholders. The Company has adhered to these requirements each taxable year since its formation in 2004 and intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of its taxable income (including its net capital gain) that is distributed to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and no relief provision applies, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and it would be disqualified from re-electing treatment as a REIT until the fifth taxable year after the year in which it failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.
 While the Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes, the unit holders of the Operating Partnership, including the Company, are subject to tax on their respective allocable shares of the Operating Partnership’s taxable income.
 The Company has one TRS, MHI Holding, in which it owns an interest through the Operating Partnership. MHI Holding is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. MHI Holding has operated at a cumulative taxable loss, through December 31, 2020, of approximately $56.0 million and deferred timing differences of approximately $1.1 million attributable to accrued, but not deductible, vacation and sick pay amounts and other depreciation and amortizable timing differences. The Company has not incurred federal income taxes since its formation. During the first quarter of this year, we reduced our deferred tax assets through the establishment of a 100% valuation allowance of approximately $5.4 million, during the year ending December 31, 2020, we increased the valuation allowance to approximately $14.7 million.
 Environmental Matters
 In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to borrow using such property as collateral. Furthermore, a person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance at a property owned by another, or who transports such substance to or from such property, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substance released into the environment at the disposal or treatment facility. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we may be potentially liable for such costs.
 We believe that our hotels are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which would have a material adverse effect on us. We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our present hotel properties.
