BUSINESS OF BURGERFI
 Opes Acquisition Corp. (“Opes”) was formed as a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on July 24, 2017 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). BurgerFi International, LLC was formed in Delaware on April 15, 2011. On December 16, 2020, to effectuate the Business Combination, Opes purchased 100% of the membership interests of BurgerFi International, LLC from the members of BurgerFi  International, LLC (“Members”), resulting in BurgerFi International, LLC  becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Opes. Subsequently, in connection with this Business Combination, Opes changed its name to “BurgerFi International, Inc.” References to the “Post-Combination Company” refer to BurgerFi International, Inc. after the consummation of the Business Combination. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” and other similar references refer to the Post-Combination Company and, unless otherwise stated, all of its subsidiaries. The term “BurgerFi” refers to the system-wide fast-casual “better burger” concept with 119 franchised and corporate-owned restaurants as of December 31,2020.  
OVERVIEW
 BurgerFi is a fast-casual “better burger” concept with approximately 119 franchised and corporate-owned restaurants, renowned for delivering an exceptional, all-natural premium burger experience in a refined, contemporary environment. BurgerFi offers a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, frozen custard, hand-cut fries, shakes, beer, wine and more. Originally founded in February 2011 by John Rosatti in sunny Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida, the purpose was simple – redeFining the way the world eats burgers by providing an upscale burger offering, at a fast-casual price point. We’ve become the go-to burger restaurant for good times, and high-quality food across the United States and beyond. Known for delivering the all-natural burger experience in a fast-casual environment, BurgerFi is committed to an uncompromising and rewarding dining experience that promises fresh food of transparent quality. 
 Today, BurgerFi is among the nation’s fastest-growing better burger concepts and was ranked as one of the Top 10 Fastest and Smartest-Growing Brands in Franchising and named a leader in its category by Franchise Times in their Fast and Serious list for both 2017 and 2018. BurgerFi was also featured in the fourth annual Chain Reaction antibiotic scorecard by National Resources Defense Council and Consumer Reports with an “A” rating – one of only two brands serving passing grade beef.

Since its inception, BurgerFi has grown steadily—with approximately 119 BurgerFi restaurants, as of December 3, 2020, comprised of 17 company-operated restaurants and 102 franchise-operated restaurants in  countries and 23 states, as well as Puerto Rico—and we continue to expand bringing the BurgerFi experience to new guests around the world. 
 Company owned restaurants
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, average sales for our Company owned restaurants were approximately $1.6 million. The typical per unit contribution at this sales level is about $250,000 annually or about 11.4%. Typically, we operate in a 2,200 to 2,400 square foot leased endcap and, to a lesser extent, free-standing or in-line space. BurgerFi does not own any real estate. We lease all our Company-owned restaurant locations. Our lease term is generally 10 to 20 years, plus two to four five-year options. We lease first- or second-generation space. Our build-out costs range from $600,000 to $1,100,000 but typically total $750,000. Our build-out costs consist of leasehold improvements, kitchen equipment, furniture, point of sale and computer equipment, security equipment and signage.
 Franchise restaurants
 We use a franchising strategy to augment new restaurant growth in new and established markets, allowing for brand expansion without significant capital investment. As of December 31, 2020, there were a total of 102 franchise restaurants. Franchisees range in size from single restaurant operators to multi-unit operators, the largest of which owns ten locations. 
 Franchise revenue is comprised of certain initial franchise fees and ongoing sales-based royalty fees from a franchised BurgerFi restaurant. Generally, the licenses granted to develop, open and operate each BurgerFi franchise in a specified territory are the predominant performance obligations transferred to the licensee in our contracts, and represent symbolic intellectual property. Ancillary promised services, such as training and assistance during the initial opening of a BurgerFi restaurant are typically combined with the licenses and considered as one performance obligation per BurgerFi franchise. Certain initial services such as site selection and lease review are considered distinct services that are recognized at a point in time when the performance obligations have been provided, generally when the BurgerFi restaurant has been opened. We determine the transaction price for each contract and allocate it to the distinct services based on their standalone selling price based on the costs to provide the service and a profit margin. The remainder of the transaction price is recognized over the remaining term of the franchise agreement once the BurgerFi restaurant has been opened. Because we are transferring licenses to access our intellectual property during a contractual term, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the license term. Generally, payment for the initial franchise fee is received upon execution of the licensing agreement. These payments are initially deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. Any related expenses are recognized in general and administrative expenses.
 We believe that franchise revenue provides stable and recurring cash flows to us and, as such, we plan to continue expanding the base of franchise-operated restaurants. In established markets, we will encourage continued growth from current franchisees and assist them in identifying and securing new locations. In emerging and new markets, we will source highly qualified and experienced new franchisees for multi-unit development opportunities. We generally seek franchisees from successful, non-competitive brands operating within the expansion markets. We market franchise opportunities through strategic networking, participation in select industry conferences, our existing website and printed materials.
 We have a Franchise Advisory Council (“FAC”) to enhance participation and engagement with the franchise community. The FAC provides input and feedback on operating and marketing strategy and initiatives.
 We have structured our corporate staff, training programs, operational systems, and communication systems to ensure we are delivering strong support to franchisees. We assist franchisees with the site selection process, and every new franchise location is scrutinized by our corporate real estate committee. We provide template plans franchisees may use for new restaurant construction and work with franchisees and their design and construction vendors to ensure compliance with brand specifications. A training program is required for all franchisees, operating partners, and restaurant management staff. Training materials introduce new franchisees to our operational performance standards and the metrics that help maintain these high standards.

BurgerFi and its franchisees are subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state, and local government levels. These include, but are not limited to, regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, zoning and building codes, franchising, land use and employee, health, sanitation, and safety matters. BurgerFi and its franchisees are required to obtain and maintain a wide variety of governmental licenses, permits and approvals. Difficulty or failure in obtaining them in the future could result in delaying or canceling the opening of new restaurants. Local authorities may suspend or deny renewal of our governmental licenses if they determine that BurgerFi’s operations do not meet the standards for initial grant or renewal.
 BurgerFi is also subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and subject to state laws that govern the offer, sale, renewal and termination of franchises and its relationship with its franchisees. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on franchise sales, fines or the requirement that BurgerFi make a rescission offer to franchisees, any of which could affect our ability to open new restaurants in the future and thus could materially adversely affect its business and operating results. Any such failure could also subject BurgerFi to liability to its franchisees.
 PURPOSE + BELIEFS
 Purpose
 BurgerFication [Bur-ger-Fi-ca-tion]
 Def: RedeFining the way the world eats burgers.
 Beliefs
  
1. | Be All-Natural
---+---------------

 There are cheaper and easier ways to cook burgers and fries, but that’s not what we do. In our modern world, efficiency and expediency often take priority over quality and savoring experiences. BurgerFi is redefining the better burger space by sticking to the tried and tested practices that make the classic American meal, well… classic. We use only the best ingredients: our beef comes from farms where cattle are humanely raised, vegetarian fed, and never exposed to steroids, antibiotics, or growth hormones – ever. We even hand-cut our potatoes, one at a time, because we know that’s how to serve crispy, crunchy fries that delight our guests every time. The truth is… All-Natural tastes better. It’s that simple.
 We also believe that the All-Natural philosophy can be lived out by every team member by letting their hospitality shine. We encourage our team members to be genuine when engaging with guests, fellow team members, franchisees, and vendors alike.
  
2. | Be Excellent
---+-------------

 At BurgerFi, we never settle. Every day we strive to be the best better burger company out there, and it shows. BurgerFi is the one of the fastest growing fast-casual brands with restaurant locations throughout the U.S. and internationally. BurgerFi consistently out-compete our peers because we are uncompromising when it comes to the quality of our food, hospitality, and people. RedeFining the way the world eats burgers requires that each and every one of us goes the extra mile in the pursuit of excellence. That means never settling for mediocrity and striving to put BurgerFi’s best foot forward every day. It’s not always going to be easy, but BurgerFi’s passion, determination, and perseverance sets BurgerFi apart.
  
3. | Be Thoughtful
---+--------------

 BurgerFi is in the people business. Sometimes in the hustle and bustle of the restaurant industry, it’s easy to forget that everything BurgerFi does is by, through, and with people. Without people there would be no BurgerFi. As such, it is our responsibility to take the necessary time to be thoughtful when we consider the impact of our actions and interactions on others. 
 3


 
4. | Be Family
---+----------

 At BurgerFi, to be family means “I’ve got your back, you’ve got mine.” It’s a dynamic that plays an important role in how our teams perform day-to-day in a fast-paced, high pressure environment. The support of a tight-knit team is what allows us to brush off the fear of failure. Our team works in concert with one another towards a shared purpose. We don’t view our work relationships as merely transactional. This manifests itself in the way we watch out for, care for, and go above and beyond for each other.
  
5. | Be You
---+-------

 Every day, BurgerFi restaurants around the world open to serve tens of thousands of people hot, juicy burgers and crispy, crunchy fries, in an exceptionally clean restaurant, by a highly energetic and motivated team. It happens like clockwork. And much like a clock, under the face, there are layers of complexity. Behind the scenes a lot of things must happen for us to deliver on our business plan. We teach our team that none of it is possible without “You”.
 BurgerFi teaches its team members that they are uniquely powerful. That they have a background and perspective that makes up who each individual is and the lens through which they view the world. These factors play a role in developing and cultivating a team member’s strengths, what they are naturally good at.
 We also actively encourage our team to take the time to learn about and appreciate other team member’s unique strengths. The most effective teams are made up of people with different abilities, who together, accomplish much more than they could alone. This focus on cultivating and enhancing our team member’s strengths has an important part in the success of the company.
  
6. | Be Courageous
---+--------------

 It takes courage to live out the BurgerFi purpose and beliefs every day. BurgerFi believes in the old axiom, that nothing worth having or doing ever comes easy. We are uncompromising when it comes to staying true to who we are.
 At the end of the day, we’re serving the classic American meal – burgers and fries. BurgerFi wants people to have some fun and find adventure in the every day. We have the courage to think originally and challenge the status quo. We are not averse to taking a calculated leap.
 We are committed to serving all-natural menu offerings, we take pride in being excellent. We are thoughtful, genuine, and courageous. This is the BurgerFi culture.
 PEOPLE
 People are at the heart of everything we do. BurgerFi acts in ways that improve people’s personal and professional lives. Every single BurgerFi team member – with their unique strengths, perspective, and role – has an important part in the success of the Company. That’s why at BurgerFi, we strive to create an environment that is inclusive and supportive of people’s aspirations and goals, so we can all continually learn and grow. Fostering this type of environment doesn’t happen by accident. It requires regular reflection, visioning, and collaboration between our team members and their managers.
 At BurgerFi, we never settle. Our shared Purpose of redeFining the way the world eats burgers requires that every day we strive to be the best better burger company out there, and it shows in our people. Our team members are trained to understand and live the BurgerFi Beliefs: Be All Natural, Be Courageous, Be Excellent, Be Family, Be Thoughtful, and Be You. We believe that our Purpose and Beliefs are the foundational components of our culture and that’s key to the way we run our business – these beliefs guide our behaviors in how we act and interact with one another, our vendors, and our communities.
 We know the most effective teams are made up of people with different abilities, who together, accomplish much more than they could alone. That is why we take the time to slow down, compassionately listen, and thoughtfully support every one of our team members and their journey towards realizing their potential. We hire for attitude and train for skill. Once we develop people’s skills, we follow a strengths philosophy and we put “aces in their places”, meaning the right person with the right skills is in the right position at the right time.

Lastly, at BurgerFi, we are family. To be family stems from a place of respect and appreciation for one another. The best team members know how important it is to cultivate a sense of family. They are the ones that always focus on helping others get better and succeed through ongoing training, learning, and development. To be family also extends beyond the four walls of our restaurants to include our loyal guests, vendors, and the communities within which we are embedded. We instill our family philosophy with all our team members from the moment they begin the recruitment process to BurgerFi all the way through their employee life cycle.
 As of December 31, 2020, our team members consisted of 629 employees, including 92 full-time employees.
 BurgerFi Pathway
 At BurgerFi, we want our team members to recognize that the opportunity in front of them is more than a job; it is a career. A key element of that is our BurgerFi Pathway. The Pathway defines the steps each team member can take to advance their career and achieve happiness and success at BurgerFi. Beginning with a team member position and working up through the General Manager or New Restaurant Opening Specialist position, the Pathway clearly lays out the requirements, responsibilities, and training associated with each step along the way. Our “next person up” philosophy conditions our leaders to constantly train, develop, and mentor the future leaders of our company. We like to call that “building our bench”.
 We first orient all new team members on the foundational components of our culture: our Purpose, Beliefs, the BurgerFi Business Plan, BurgerFi’s differentiating DNA, and our Non-Negotiables. From there, team members will learn our menu and become specialized in all aspects of our operations, one station at a time. It is all about mastering the fundamentals and we give our team members the tools and resources necessary to do that.
 We rely on the Tell, Show, Do, Review method when it comes to our training. We recognize that our team members learn differently, so our training, learning, and development uses a variety of methods: interactive online courses, videos, gamified content through our cutting-edge learning management system, paper-based, and hands-on, real-life experiences. It is important that we offer training, learning, and development tailored to the preferred learning styles of our individual team members. Our BurgerFi Development Online learning management system (“FIDO”) offers our team members all of our training content right at their fingertips. Our FIDO platform has a social newsfeed that allows team members to share exciting news and updates from their restaurant, challenge other restaurant teams to a dance video contest, and to send recognition messages, comments, and thanks to their fellow team members across the Company. That is what it means to be family. And, at the end of the day, we’re serving the classic American meal – burgers and fries. We want people to have some fun and we embed that into our training.
 For hands-on training, we gather teams in our premier training restaurants in South Florida, where our brand got started. Team members from both the restaurants and our Restaurant Support Center (“RSC”) become immersed in our BurgerFi restaurant culture through these training restaurants. All new RSC and restaurant managers begin with an Orientation at our RSC, headquartered in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. We also use the RSC to host our multi-day Developing Impactful Leaders Program for our seasoned restaurant managers and for our month-long, interactive online Field Certification Program for new managers.
 We care deeply about our people and are committed to setting them up for success, both at BurgerFi and in their future careers. We believe in a promote from within culture at BurgerFi and nothing makes us happier than when we see our team members develop into Team Leads, Assistant Managers, and General Managers. We are especially proud that we have current General Managers in the system that began their BurgerFi careers as hourly team members when we opened our first BurgerFi in Lauderdale-By-The-Sea in 2011.
 The importance of retaining top talent cannot be understated. We are deeply committed to recognizing and developing our leaders through enhanced recognition, training, compensation, and benefits to do so. We are constantly looking at ways to support our restaurant leaders by giving them the opportunity to feel like owners, rewarding them for their performance, providing them with access to world-class coaching and leadership development opportunities, and always being there for them when they need anything. Again, that is what being family is all about.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 BurgerFi is committed to creating an inclusive and equitable environment that supports the growth and success of our team members from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, genders,  races, experiences, and more.

• | Equal Opportunity – Rooted in our BurgerFi Purpose and Beliefs, we strive to become an employer of choice by providing equal opportunities for, and removing obstacles to, success, while also fostering a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The purpose of the BurgerFi Beliefs is to establish a shared language and set of behaviors that each BurgerFi team member must live by. These beliefs are an integral part of sharing and promoting a culture of inclusion within the organization and beyond.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are continually looking to enhance our culture of inclusion and in 2020 we have stepped up our efforts, highlighted by:
  
• | Mentorship Program – BurgerFi believes in a promote from within culture. Launching a new mentorship program will allow us to enhance that philosophy through partnering seasoned BurgerFi team members with new team members looking to build their career through the BurgerFi Pathway.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | B2B Program – BurgerFi has experts in their fields throughout the Company and we want to shine a light on their talents through our B2B (BurgerFi to BurgerFi) Program. The B2B Program will allow our team members to share their talents and experiences with other BurgerFi team members.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Learning and Development – We are rolling out training for all our team members, in particular those in leadership positions, on topics including: overcoming biases, conflict resolution, de-escalation, difficult conversations, and professionalism. The intention behind these trainings, which will be available through FIDO, is to enhance our inclusive culture and allow our team members to fulfill their potential. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GUEST EXPERIENCE
 At BurgerFi we strive to provide our guests with an unparalleled better burger experience.
 Positioning and Brand Voice
 Our unique positioning is seated within the high-growth, better-burger space. Our chef-driven menu offerings and eco-friendly restaurant design drive our brand communication. Our brand voice, derived from our commitment to better-for-you, indulgent food, is playful and emphasizes the BurgerFi Purpose and Beliefs to team members, guests and stakeholders alike. BurgerFi remains committed to redeFining the way the world eats burgers, and we believe our guests understand our dedication to the values and causes that are important to them. 
 Technology-Enhanced Brand
 Integral to our purpose, BurgerFi harnesses innovation and technology to offer our guests opportunities to enjoy our food when and where they want. In addition to ordering in-restaurant at the counter, guests can enjoy BurgerFi by ordering through 1) the BurgerFi App 2) the BurgerFi website 3) their preferred third-party delivery service provider and 4) on-site kiosks (available at 20% of our restaurants).
 The BurgerFi App allows us to connect with guests in a meaningful way through a custom loyalty program tailored to reward users with offers based on their preferences, frequency, and order history. In addition, guests can order through the app for on-demand delivery, which results in lower delivery fees and transit times for the guest. The app can also be used for mobile payments and sharing the BurgerFi experience through gift cards.
 Mobile and desktop web-based ordering is available to guests for all domestic BurgerFi restaurants through the BurgerFi website. Guests can order ahead for pick-up and delivery the same as they would using the BurgerFi app and are treated to an intuitive and highly customizable experience, appealing to a variety of food preferences.

In addition to online ordering options, BurgerFi routes all inbound phone orders to a centralized call center (instead of directly to a BurgerFi restaurant), to provide guests with an attentive operator to take their order, and so as to not distract team members from focusing on in-restaurant guest services.
 As an early adopter of off-premises dining channels, BurgerFi has also invested in partnerships with third-party delivery service providers (“DSPs”). 99% of BurgerFi restaurants are available on at least one third-party delivery provider and 90% are available on the top four U.S. DSPs – DoorDash, GrubHub, UberEats, and Postmates.
 BurgerFi plans to expand its delivery presence nationwide through a strategic partnership with REEF Technology, which has created delivery-only neighborhood kitchens, otherwise known as “ghost kitchens.” With a distributed real estate network of more than 5,000 locations and 10,000 logistics and real estate professionals across 50 cities, REEF is the largest operator of logistics hubs and neighborhood kitchens in the United States. REEF develops ecosystems that connect people to the goods, services, and experiences that neighborhoods need to thrive.
 Commissary and Test Kitchen
 Our commissary is located in North Palm Beach, FL and is connected to our RSC. The FDA approved kitchen is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment that allows us to create unique and differentiating products for the system. The goal of the commissary is to provide BurgerFi an international supply chain advantage of proven, industry superior products with added control over ingredients and product quality and consistency.
Our Menu
 BurgerFi’s highly customizable menu appeals to guests seeking both quality and transparency and features a broad selection of burgers including plant-based and veggie burgers, chicken, and fresh-made sides. BurgerFi offers only 100% natural angus beef with zero steroids, antibiotics, growth hormones, chemicals, or additives (~1% of U.S. beef meets this criteria).
 In addition, BurgerFi serves a variety of craft beers and wines. Selections are locally sourced and tailored to each community that we serve. We constantly look to enhance our wine program with the addition of 350ml splits, wines on tap, and canned rosé at participating locations.
 All-Natural American Angus Beef
 Angus is known for being a tender, flavorful, and juicy meat. We source from a coop of like-minded ranchers that follow strict practices to ensure their beef is raised entirely without antibiotics.
Why Use All-Natural Angus?
  
• | No Antibiotics, No Hormones – Never, Ever!
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Source and Age Verified – All of our beef is 100% sourced in the United States of America.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vegetarian Fed – No animal byproducts are used. The cattle’s diet consists of a vegetarian feed fortified with natural vitamins and minerals for health.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Humane Handling Standards – BurgerFi believes all cattle sourced into our beef program should be handled in a humane manner. We only do business with suppliers who are willing to sign off on an agreement to care for their animals with our humane handling standards and accepted credible humane handling programs. When cattle are raised in a calm and healthy environment, tender and flavorful meat is the outcome.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wagyu Beef Burgers and Hot Dogs
 Not only do we serve the highest quality Angus beef burgers, we also serve even higher quality Wagyu beef burgers and hot dogs. Wagyu beef contains a high level of marbling, flavor, and tenderness. We utilize Wagyu beef from Snake River Farms in our most premium burger, The CEO, and our premium Wagyu beef hot dogs.
 7


All-Natural Cage-Free Chicken
 At BurgerFi, we’re committed to providing our guests with the highest quality Angus, but we also hold the same standards when it comes to serving the highest quality, 100% all-natural chicken breast.
 We source our chicken breasts and our Fi’ed Chicken Tenders from Springer Mountain Farms because of their commitment to quality and humane practices. Springer Mountain Farms is a family-owned business nestled in the hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Baldwin, Georgia. Their chickens are all-natural with no steroids or hormones, but also are produced with no antibiotics, are never fed animal by-products, and are American Humane Association certified.
 Beyond Meat
 At BurgerFi we want to satisfy as many burger cravings as we can, even for those who do not eat beef. In 2017 BurgerFi was the very first national restaurant brand to introduce the Beyond Burger, from Beyond Meat. The Beyond Burger is the world’s first plant-based burger that looks, cooks, and satisfies like beef without GMOs, soy, or gluten. We offer this burger in two ways – vegan and non-vegan.
Potatoes
 At BurgerFi, we hand cut our fries every day. The potatoes we use are Idaho Burbank potatoes, prized for being the highest quality potato in the restaurant industry. We fry them in a high oleic canola oil, which has a high smoking point and a better flavor for frying. The fries are cooked when the customer orders them, not sitting under a heat lamp waiting for the customer.
Onion Rings
 At BurgerFi, we use jumbo or colossal Spanish onions. The onions are cut in-house, breaded with our secret seasoned flour recipe, then dipped in our homemade beer batter before they are fried to a crispy golden brown. Our onion rings are cooked to order, ensuring the crispiest onion ring possible.
Premium Custard
 Guests can satisfy their sweet tooth with a wide selection of rich, creamy custard cups, concretes, and shakes. Our custard is made with high-quality ingredients, using dairy supply that is free from steroids and bovine growth hormones.
Coca-Cola Freestyle Machine
 All traditional BurgerFi restaurants are equipped with the Coca-Cola Freestyle soda machine which features over 160 flavors for our guests to choose from. Included in BurgerFi restaurants only is the FI LIME FUSION, our signature soda co-created with our friends at Coca-Cola. The signature green soda is a tart lime flavor with juicy citrus notes.
System-Wide Limited Time Offerings 
 Our Limited Time Offerings (“LTOs”) program features unique sandwiches and custard shakes throughout the year. LTOs allow us to grow our following, increase guest frequency, and test new products that can potentially become permanent menu additions. We have historically rolled out LTOs on a consistent basis, with fan favorites, such as the CEO Burger, which has become a staple to the core menu. As a collaborative effort between the culinary, operations and marketing teams, the Company carefully tests new products at corporate locations to obtain customer feedback and analyze the key performance indicators before rolling them out to the entire system. Some of our notable LTOs throughout 2019 and 2020 were:
 Street Stack (Q2 2019): This sandwich was BurgerFi’s take on classic street food. The Street Stack featured griddle corn cakes (arepas), an all-natural Angus beef, melted white cheddar and mozzarella cheese, smoky bacon, and house-made charred jalapeño pico de gallo.

Fi’ed Chicken Tenders (Q3 2019): We launched the third of our Springer Mountain Farms Chicken offerings to further leverage BurgerFi’s responsible procurement positioning. Fi’ed Chicken Tenders were available in quantities of 3, 5, 10 and a 2-piece kids’ meal. This product has since been seated as a permanent menu item.
 Wagyu Bacon Cheddar Melt + Milk & Cookies Shake (Q4 2019): This burger featured two ultra-high-quality Wagyu beef burgers, thick-cut crispy bacon, white cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and a steak sauce aioli – served on thick-cut Texas-style toast. The shake was made with our creamy vanilla custard and loaded with chunky chocolate chip cookies and sprinkles in honor of the holiday season.
 Conflicted Burger + Frozen Hot Chocolate Shake (Q1 2020): As a fun way for our guests to ditch their well-intentioned New Year’s resolutions, we promoted our Conflicted Burger and Conflicted Shake. Our Conflicted Burger features 100% Natural Angus Beef topped with American cheese stacked on top of our award-winning VegeFi Burger® topped with white cheddar and served on a potato bun with lettuce, tomato, and signature Fi Sauce. Our Frozen Hot Chocolate shake featured creamy chocolate custard made with real hot chocolate and toasted marshmallows.
 The Baconian Burger + Bacon Jam Fries (Q1 2020): Bacon-lovers across the nation enjoyed our chef-inspired bacon burger featuring bacon prepared in four different ways. The Baconian incorporated 100% natural double angus beef and pork belly blend burgers, topped with smoked bacon cheddar cheese, thick-cut bacon, sautéed onions and bacon aioli. Bacon Jam Fries highlighted our fresh-cut, Idaho potatoes topped with melted cheese, pieces of bacon and bacon jam.

COVID-19 Delivery and Take-out Initiative
 In mid-March 2020, BurgerFi redirected significant efforts to support delivery and pre-paid pick-up orders through the BurgerFi App, DSPs (UberEats, GrubHub, Postmates, and others), and website. 
 Marquee Events
 BurgerFi is a brand committed to giving back to the communities we are part of. In addition to our continuous charitable efforts, we participate in events to raise money for social good, while building brand awareness, including:

• | Ditka & Jaws Cigars with the Stars (Miami, FL, January 30, 2020): Every year, Mike Ditka (Hall of Famer, Chicago Bears) and Ron Jaworski (Hall of Famer, Philadelphia Eagles) host a Super Bowl Party for NFL Alumni and Hall of Famers in order to raise funds and awareness for two charitable causes – Gridiron Greats and Youth Playbook. Youth Playbook focuses on its mission to improve the overall health and wellness of at-risk youth, while Gridiron Greats assists former NFL players financially, socially, and medically. In order to accommodate the 1200 guests in attendance at this ultra-VIP event, BurgerFi built a fully operational kitchen in order to provide catering on the pool deck of the Paramount Miami World Center. BurgerFi has already been asked to return to the 2021 Super Bowl in Tampa, Florida.

• | BurgerFi’s Chow Down for Charity (Miami, Florida September 19, 2019): In honor of Hunger Action Month and National Cheeseburger Day, BurgerFi hosted our first annual Chow Down for Charity to help ‘end hunger one bite at a time’. BurgerFi invited Guinness Book of World Record Competitive Eating Champion, Takeru Kobayashi to help raise funds and awareness for Feeding South Florida. BurgerFi also invited Miami Heat superstar, Bam Adebayo, retired NFL Super Bowl champion and University of Miami NCAA Champion, Russell Maryland, and retired NBA Utah Jazz and Motivational Speaker, Walter Bond. The 2-day event included an autograph-signing, a meet and greet with celebrity guests, and the contribution of funds to provide 47,600 meals to food insecure individuals in the South Florida area.

 BurgerFi’s digital strategy is to leverage social media and CRM platforms to continuously engage with guests – specifically Millennials who are highly active on social media, rely on technology to make informed purchasing decisions, and generally gravitate towards authentic brands that lack a “chain” feel. This tactical customer engagement approach has resulted in double digit-increases in web, search, and social media metrics, and has contributed store sales increases that have outperformed its industry segment.
 BurgerFi’s Sprinklr software tracks guest sentiment through social channels and the Company’s own customer care website. Operating teams and franchisees are trained to quickly react to notifications that are integrated within BurgerFi’s system architecture, giving teams the ability to quickly affect operational corrections and “recapture” guests. Aspiring to win the hearts of its customers, BurgerFi engages with 100% of reviews (both positive and negative) across all channels. The Company is on pace to receive 50,000 reviews in 2020.
 System-Wide Promotions (Rewards, Single Day Events, Other)
 System-wide promotions are shared on social media, email, and other digital platforms to incentivize new guests to visit our restaurants and build frequency of existing guests. The following are some examples of our system-wide promotions:

DEVELOPMENT
 Not only is BurgerFi committed to delivering an all-natural premium burger, we also strive to provide an elevated and contemporary dining experience. We put the same thoughtfulness and attention into site selection, construction, and design as we do with our food and hospitality.
Site Selection 
 BurgerFi’s Real Estate department functions in a manner consistent with the overall BurgerFi purpose and beliefs. This is evidenced by the holistic, perfectionist approach of our site selection criteria. We actively search specific, strategically selected markets for potential new BurgerFi locations. In each selected market, we evaluate these initial sites using the following criteria:

• | Visibility and signage
--+-----------------------


• | Ingress and egress
--+-------------------


• | Ample parking
--+--------------


• | Anchor tenants (Publix, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Kroger, Lifetime fitness, etc.)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Co-tenants (Starbucks, Chipotle, Panera, Blaze Pizza, etc.)
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trade area (lunch/dinner)
--+--------------------------


• | Flexible sites: Endcaps, premium in-line, non-traditional (i.e., airports).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Footprints – 2,000-2,400 square feet with exterior patio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 Our strategy is to cluster multiple BurgerFi’s in a Demographic Market Area (“DMA”). We believe this clustering allows efficiencies in labor, including knowledge base, “pro-teams”, cross-training and developing and training new managers. Additionally, we believe this clustering allows better leverage in media buying, brand awareness, and culture. We target demographics with high concentrations of well-educated consumers, with above average income levels, who care about what they eat. Beyond our great food, we offer our target consumers a contemporary restaurant design with eco-friendly fixtures and upcycled furniture. Our wholesome atmosphere is thoughtfully designed to enhance the guest experience and to complement shopping centers and communities as well.
 Our ideal footprint is 2,200 to 2,400 square feet, usually an endcap in a shopping center. In selecting a site, we closely study key physical attributes, as well as trade area and other comparative data, to assess the quality and viability of a location. Each potential site is carefully analyzed and reviewed by our Real Estate team using the newest AI software. The best locations are analyzed for their internal rate of return (“IRR”) using multiple projected sales scenarios. Once a site has met our IRR criteria it is then brought to a Real Estate Committee for further consideration and scrutiny. We believe that aggressive and ongoing market review, coupled with detailed analysis, should provide a consistent stream of great locations for ongoing future development.
 Construction
 Once a site is successfully permitted, a BurgerFi restaurant can be built in approximately a 70- day period. During these 70 working days, all construction is completed, and the space is then turned over to the Operational team approximately 85 days from construction start. We partner with a number of general contractors regionally throughout the country, and strive to effectively manage the bidding process of each project to ensure quality standards are kept up to par.

Typically, a BurgerFi buildout ranges from $600,000 to $1,100,000 which includes the initial franchise fee of $37,500. The cost of leasehold improvements varies with the restaurant footprint and square footage, but on average the leasehold improvement costs for a 2,400 square foot space ranges from $110 to $140 per square foot.
 Design 
 BurgerFi restaurants feature an inviting, next-gen look and feel, appealing to consumers of all ages seeking an engaging, high-quality dining experience.
 There are many fixtures and furnishings inside that tell a story of sustainability like upcycled furniture items, such as our 111 Navy Coca-Cola chairs, or our energy efficient Macro Air fans and LED lighting that reduce our overall carbon footprint. These products and materials are sourced through our preferred vendors to meet the needs of the restaurants. The main design goal at BurgerFi is to provide an updated, sleek look that is practical for our consumers and provides them with a warm inviting feel. Over the years we have gone through small design evolutions within the four restaurant walls to not only better suit the needs of our guests but also the needs of our team members. We strive to please our guests and in doing so need to create an open space with great quality materials that can be easily cleaned and will withstand the wear and tear of time.
 Like most restaurants, we have learned that the delivery channel is an opportunity to innovate our kitchen design. We have worked to equip our kitchens with a layout that is both effective and efficient at increasing our output of products. We have vetted certain equipment pieces that allow us to keep up with desired cook times while providing the best possible end-product for the guest.
 Over the years BurgerFi has been very adaptive with our direction of growth. As we move forward, we are constantly reinventing the overall size of our design so we can better fit into non-traditional, spaces that give us greater visibility in the fast-casual burger scene.
 Intellectual Property
 We own, domestically and internationally, valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other. proprietary information related to our restaurant and corporate brands. This intellectual property includes logos and trademarks which are of material importance to our business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. We seek to actively protect and defend our intellectual property from infringement and misuse.
Franchise Program
 Overview
 We use a franchising strategy to augment new restaurant growth in new and established markets, allowing for brand expansion without significant internal capital investment. Our first franchise location was opened in 2012. As of December 31, 2020, there were a total of 102 franchise restaurants in the United States. Franchisees range in size from single restaurant operators to multi-unit operators, the largest of which owns 10 locations. 
 We believe that franchise revenue provides stable and recurring cash flows to us and, as such, we plan to continue expanding the base of franchise operated restaurants. In established markets, we will encourage continued growth from current franchisees and assist them in identifying and securing new locations. In emerging and new markets, we will source highly qualified and experienced new franchisees for multi-unit development opportunities. Although historically we’ve had a significant blend of one to two store franchise operators in our system, in expansion markets we will strive to seek franchisees from successful, non-competitive brands operating within those markets. We market franchise opportunities through strategic networking, participation in select industry conferences, our existing website and printed materials.
 We have several forums to enhance participation and engagement with our franchise community. FAC works with their group of franchise constituents to communicate and collaborate with our RSC providing input, feedback, and marketing strategy and system wide initiatives. Cross functional teams comprised of company operators, franchise operators and executive team members collaborate to enhance vendor relationships and negotiate favorable win-win scenarios for both the BurgerFi system and our vendor partners. 
 12


Franchise Owner Support
 We have structured our corporate staff, training programs, operational systems, and communication systems to ensure we are delivering strong, effective support to our franchisees. We assist franchisees with the site selection process, and every new franchise location is scrutinized by our corporate real estate team. We provide template plans franchisees may use for new restaurant construction and work with franchisees and their design and construction vendors to ensure compliance with brand specifications. A training program is required for all franchisees, operating partners, and management staff. Training materials introduce new franchisees to our operational performance standards and the metrics that help maintain these high standards.
 For the first two restaurant openings for a new franchisee, we typically provide significant on-site support, with more modest support for subsequent openings for that franchisee. On an ongoing basis, we collect and disseminate customer experience feedback on a real time basis through a third-party vendor. We also conduct regular on-site audits at each franchise location, although in the COVID-19 environment we perform our internal inspections through video collaboration and also use Steritech, a third-party vendor, to physically inspect each location and timely provide us with their full report. Our Regional Operations Leaders are dedicated to ongoing franchise support and oversight, regularly visiting each franchise territory. However, in the recent COVID-19 environment that we are experiencing, travel has been limited. Our marketing department assists franchisees with local marketing programs and guidance with our national marketing campaigns. We typically communicate with franchisees through our company newsletter, the “Bugle”, which is published monthly and hold weekly inter-active webinar meetings to update our franchisee teams and conduct additional training. We also hold an annual summit for franchisees, vendors, and company operations leaders to review overall performance, celebrate shared success, communicate best practices, and plan for the year ahead.
 Charitable Partners 
 From 2017-2019, BurgerFi raised $236,235 to help fund St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The funds were raised through our limited time offer (LTO) products such as the Very Berry Wafflewich and the Steakhouse Bleu Burger. The donation from each LTO product sale was $1, which went directly to St. Jude.
 In September of 2019, for Hunger Action Month and National Cheeseburger Day, BurgerFi partnered with Feeding South Florida to help “end hunger one bite at a time.” With the funds raised, we were able to provide 47,600 meals for food insecure individuals in the South Florida area. We are now in conversations with their parent organization, Feeding America, about a long-term partnership.
 In May of 2020, BurgerFi partnered with the Marcum Foundation to deliver 20,000 meals to healthcare heroes on the frontlines of COVID-19 in major cities throughout the United States.
 For new restaurant openings, we invite local ‘hometown heroes’ such as firefighters, police officers and EMT’s, to enjoy a complimentary meal in honor of the Grand Opening.
 Additionally, each BurgerFi regularly hosts Give Back Nights to help raise funds for charitable causes in the communities that they serve. Supporters who attend these events will have a minimum of 15% of their order totals donated to benefit the charitable organization.
 SUPPLY CHAIN
 Sourcing
 The Brand’s philosophy since day one is to work with best-in-class suppliers across our supply chain so that we can always provide top quality, better-for-you food for our guests. For our meat, we source from some of best ranches in the United States including Meyer Company Ranch, Snake River Farms, and Springer Mountain Farms, who share in our commitment to all-natural food, with no hormones or antibiotics, that is humanely raised and source verified. In 2018, we received an “A” grading from the Natural Resources Defense Council in their Chain Reaction Report for sourcing beef raised without any antibiotics (one of only two burger chains to have done so). In addition, our bread is free of synthetic chemicals, our ketchup is free of corn syrup, and we use cage-free eggs. For more information, our animal welfare policy can be found on our BurgerFi website.

At BurgerFi we ensure that our beef is always freshly ground and never frozen at all domestic locations. As we’ve grown, we have partnered with the largest and most respected grinding facility in the industry. With this partnership we have transparent auditable pricing, backup production facility plans, and have secured multiple vendor supply partnerships.
 We have carefully selected domestic suppliers based on quality, transparency, and reliability for our major ingredients, including beef, chicken, potato buns, custard, produce, and potatoes. We purchased all of our ground beef and chicken from two suppliers, potato buns from one supplier, and custard from two suppliers. Should we experience any interruptions or shortage, we have identified alternatives to substitute services and products which we believe will maintain our high standards of quality and transparency.
 Distribution
 We contract with one distributor to provide almost all of our food distribution services in the United States. This distributor processes approximately 90% of our core food and beverage ingredients and 100% of our paper goods and chemicals for distribution and delivery to each BurgerFi. We utilize 24 affiliated distribution centers to supply our domestic franchise and Company-operated restaurants. We regularly assess our broadline distributor to ensure our strict safety and quality standards are met and that the prices they offer are competitive.
Food Safety 
 At BurgerFi, food safety is of the utmost importance. Within our restaurants we have stringent food safety and quality protocols that help our teams ensure they are providing a safe place to eat for our guests and team members alike. Utilizing in-house temperature and quality audits throughout the day, we strive to verify that all products are safe and of highest quality.
 Additionally, we use a third-party auditing system, Steritech, designed to ensure we meet and exceed local health standards. These Steritech audits are completed periodically and without notice with the goal of ensuring that our restaurants maintain our high standards at all hours of the day. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have initiated an additional Steritech COVID-19 Protocol audit for each restaurant each quarter.
 Through FIDO, we provide our restaurants with tools and resources at the click of a button. These tools include COVID-19 reopening tactics, expectations for team members, disinfecting processes, and equipment cleaning protocols.
 Management Information Systems
 All of our traditional domestic and international Company and franchise-operated restaurants use computerized point-of-sale and back-office systems that are designed specifically for the restaurant industry and are operated by highly trained BurgerFi team members. In addition, some domestic locations also offer guest facing self-ordering kiosk technology. Both point-of-sales systems provide touch screen interfaces, order confirmation displays, kitchen displays and integrated, high-speed credit card, gift card and BurgerFi loyalty program processing. The information collected from the point-of-sale system includes daily transaction data, which generates information about sales, average transaction size as well as product mix information. This system allows our management teams to run various reports and access vital information to assist them in controlling food and labor costs on a daily basis.
 This information also provides the Regional Operations leaders and the RSC real-time, detailed information to assist our management teams with the day-to-day operations of each location so they can efficiently and confidently operate their restaurants.
 GROWTH STRATEGIES
 In 2019, BurgerFi opened 15 new restaurants, resulting in the creation of approximately 450 jobs. During the year December 31, 2020 we have opened three company-owned restaurants, eight franchise restaurants and seven delivery-only licensed ghost kitchens.

Traditional Company and Franchise Restaurant Development
 BurgerFi currently enjoys a larger geographic footprint than several of its “better burger” competitors, with significant growth headroom for new development in greenfield areas as well as clustering in existing markets.
 Our goal is to strategically position new units to either cluster within existing markets or to build-out important new DMAs through multi-unit development. We believe BurgerFi is powerfully positioned with a pipeline of new units projected to open through 2021 and 2022 resulting from a combination of franchise and new corporate restaurant development.
 A key indicator of the overall appeal and staying power of the BurgerFi model comes from existing multi-unit franchisees who continue to build on their initial successes by adding new BurgerFi units to their portfolio.
 Non-Traditional Partnerships
 In recent years BurgerFi has begun targeting “non-traditional” venues, like airports, transportation hubs, toll roads, higher education, military bases, and sporting venues, for restaurant locations. Initial promising licensing agreements with major food and beverage operators include Aramark, HMS Host, Delaware North, SSP America, and the US Air Force Services Activity. Expansion in these areas should produce significant additional growth through marquee, high-volume units.
 Delivery Only Expansion
 In April 2020, BurgerFi signed a license agreement with REEF Technology to open delivery-only kitchens, also known as “ghost kitchens,” in major markets throughout the United States. With a distributed real estate network of more than 5,000 locations and 10,000 logistics and real estate professionals across 50 cities, REEF is the largest operator of logistics hubs, and neighborhood kitchens, in the United States.
 The partnership with REEF Technology will allow for BurgerFi to expand into new major markets like Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Houston, Nashville, and Minneapolis. BurgerFi launched its first kitchen on June 15, 2020 in Miami and is targeting to having approximately 25 operating kitchens by the end of 2021.
 United States Air Force Services Activity Partnership
 BurgerFi signed a license agreement with the US Air Force Services Activity in October 2019 with plans to open restaurants on five Air Force bases in the U.S. The Air Force Services Activity chose BurgerFi as part of their global initiative to enhance food quality, variety and availability on Air Force bases throughout the U.S. and abroad. 
 Millennial and Gen-Z generations, who are largely represented in new recruits enlisting in military divisions, are more likely to demand high quality, natural food offerings. The military is turning to brands like BurgerFi to meet these preferences.
 Centralized Commissary Kitchen
 BurgerFi’s centralized commissary kitchen is located in North Palm Beach, FL and is equipped with high-speed, automated equipment for mass production of select products with greater efficiency and consistency under the supervision of a skilled food production team. The kitchen allows for BurgerFi to generate revenue by manufacturing and distributing proprietary products for the system that differentiate its brand among its competitors. It also gives BurgerFi added control over ingredients, quality, and product consistency.
 Phase 2 of the Commissary, set to launch in the second quarter of 2021, includes the production of BurgerFi’s proprietary sauces (Fi Sauce, Honey Mustard BBQ, Garlic Aioli, and others).

Expanding and Enhancing Guest Experience 
 Menu Innovation
 BurgerFi continues to evaluate and enhance our menu offerings to highlight quality and value for our guests. Our menu represents our commitment to responsible procurement and showcases our 100% all-natural American Angus beef. In addition, our menu offerings also feature the farms and ranches where we source our Wagyu beef (Snake River Farms) and NAE Chicken (Springer Mountain Farms).
Digital Expansion - Loyalty Program
 The BurgerFi App was rolled out in 2018. The BurgerFi App and our Loyalty Program are pillars for our rapid growth, and we are committed to continue our investment in and enhancement of the platform to provide the best experience for our guests, and in so doing, grow our user base exponentially.
 In 2020, BurgerFi made enhancements to our rewards program with the goal of garnering more loyalty and frequency amongst our guests while improving the ROI and profitability of the platform at the restaurant level. In the first phase we focused on making the rewards program simpler to understand for guests and our front-of-house team members alike. Looking forward, we intend to continue to streamline the loyalty features, while increasing brand storytelling, surprise and delight opportunities, and offers to engage our most loyal guests.
 Tapping into the Growing “Conscious Consumer” Market 
 We believe that many consumers and investors want to associate with brands that have a heightened commitment to environmental and social practices. As the Millennial and Gen Z generations continue to grow and exercise their spending powers towards higher quality, authentic brands, we believe BurgerFi will become the go-to destination for those consumers and investors whose beliefs align with ours.
 BurgerFi believes in clean, transparent, and sustainable restaurant ecosystems, which includes a full commitment to the humane treatment of animals. Since its inception, BurgerFi has taken the position of advocating for best practices in humane animal treatment. In 2018, BurgerFi was named as one of the top two national brands in the burger industry maintaining the highest standards for the sourcing of our beef. We received an “A” on the fourth annual Chain Reaction scorecard released by six major consumer and environmental organizations. In 2019, BurgerFi was named Best Burger Joint by the Chain Reaction Report. We have had this commitment to excellence and the highest standards since our doors opened in 2011.
 Environmental sustainability guides our decision-making when it comes to BurgerFi restaurant construction and design – we are all-natural and proud of it. From using number two southern pine lumber, some of the most renewable wood on the planet, to our energy efficient appliances, we constantly look at the ways in which we can minimize our environmental footprint.
 Aggressive Growth Plans Deserve Aggressive Marketing Initiatives
 BurgerFi has differentiated itself from other fast casual, better burger competitors through our product quality and transparency, continuous investment in a technology infrastructure, commitment to sustainability, and our industry-leading digital and social marketing strategy.
 Rarely has a nearly 119-unit restaurant brand received such extensive recognition by industry and consumers in such a short period of time. BurgerFi has been named in Fast Casual’s Top 100 Movers and Shakers for 7 years in a row (beginning in 2013), was on Nation’s Restaurant’s News’ 2019 Fast Casual Top Movers and Shakers and was even recognized as New York City’s Best Veggie Burger by the New Yorker. 
 Additional notable placements include in Franchise Times, Restaurant Business, New York Times, Bloomberg, USA Today, Fox Business, Mashed, Thrillist, Delish, Ad Age and more, as well as on shows such as CNBC Squawk Alley, Fox & Friends morning show, and Fox News.
