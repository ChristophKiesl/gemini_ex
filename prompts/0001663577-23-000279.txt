ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 
Global System Dynamics, Inc. (formerly known as Gladstone Acquisition Corporation, which we refer to as "we", "us" or the "Company") is a blank check company that was incorporated in January 2021 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our "Initial Business Combination” or “Business Combination."


While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we are focusing on industries that complement our management team’s background, and we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business, focusing on farming and national security sectors, including farming and national security related operations and businesses that support the those industries, where our management team has extensive experience.
 
We are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from our IPO, described below. To date, we have been involved in organizational activities, activities related to our initial public offering, activities related to finding a prospective business combination target, and activities related to our Initial Business Combination.
 
The Company's sponsor is DarkPulse, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Sponsor"). In addition to being the Sponsor, DarkPulse is also a party to the Merger Agreement as the target of Initial Business Combination.
 
Capitalization, Initial Public Offering and Initial Business Combination
 
As described further in the Notes to the Company's financial statements contained in this Annual Report, on January 25, 2021, Gladstone Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the original sponsor (the Original Sponsor”) paid $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share, to cover certain offering costs in consideration for 2,875,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 (the "Class B Common Stock" or "founder shares".) Up to 375,000 shares of Class B Common Stock were subject to forfeiture to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters. The forfeiture would be adjusted to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the Class B Common Stock would represent 20% of the Company's issued and outstanding stock after the Company's IPO.
 
A registration statement for the Company's IPO was declared effective on August 4, 2021 (the "Effective Date"). On August 9, 2021, the Company consummated its IPO of 10,000,000 units (each, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") at $10.00 per Unit and the sale of 4,200,000 warrants (the "Private Warrants") at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant in a private placement to the Original Sponsor that closed simultaneously with the IPO. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A Common Stock" or "public shares") and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the "Public Warrants"). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Only whole warrants are exercisable. On August 18, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an additional 492,480 Units, generating an aggregate of gross proceeds of $4,924,800.
 
Simultaneously with the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, the Original Sponsor purchased an additional 98,496 Private Warrants, generating aggregate gross proceeds of $98,496. On September 18, 2021, the underwriters' over-allotment option expired and as a result 251,880 shares of Class B Common Stock were forfeited, resulting in outstanding Class B Common Stock of 2,623,120 shares.

As payment for services, the underwriters received 209,850 shares of Class A Common Stock worth approximately $10.00 per share (the "Representative Shares"). Transaction costs related to the IPO and partial over-allotment exercise amounted to $6,265,859 consisting of $3,672,368 of deferred underwriting commissions, $2,098,500 of fair value of the Representative Shares and $494,990 of other cash offering costs, which were allocated among Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption, the Public Warrants and Private Warrants, and stockholders' deficit.
 
We have broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the Private Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating an Initial Business Combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete an Initial Business Combination successfully. We must complete one or more Initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions) at the time of the agreement to enter into the Initial Business Combination. However, we will only complete an Initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act").
 
Following the closing of the IPO on August 9, 2021 and the partial over-allotment exercise on August 18, 2021, $107,023,296 ($10.20 per Unit) from the net proceeds sold in the IPO and over-allotment, including a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Warrants, was deposited in a trust account (the "Trust Account") which is being invested only in U.S. government securities, with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its tax obligations, the proceeds from the IPO will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of the Company's Initial Business Combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) modify the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to provide for the redemption of its public stock in connection with an Initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its public stock if the Company does not complete its Initial Business Combination in the time period required by its charter or (ii) with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders' rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity, and (c) the redemption of the Company's public shares if the Company is unable to complete its Initial Business Combination in the timeframe required by its charter, subject to applicable law.
 
The Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (initially approximately $10.20 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations).
 
The Class A Common Stock subject to redemption was recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 480, "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity." In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company’s Class A Common Stock are not a “penny share” upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.

--


If, however, stockholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction, whether they participate in or abstain from voting or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of its Initial Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions in connection with its Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a "group" (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO, without the Company's prior consent. The Sponsor, officers and directors (the "Initial Stockholders") have agreed not to propose any amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (a) that would modify the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to provide for the redemption of its public shares in connection with an Initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the public shares if the Company does not complete its Initial Business Combination in the time period required by its charter or (b) with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders' rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A Common Stock shares in conjunction with any such amendment.
 
If the Company is unable to complete its Initial Business Combination in the time period required by its charter, the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company's remaining stockholders and the Company's board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company's obligations under the law of the state of Delaware to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
The Company's Initial Stockholders, as well as holders of Representative Shares, agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, respectively, held by them if the Company fails to complete its Initial Business Combination in the time period required by its charter. However, if the Initial Stockholders acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination in the time period required by its charter.

Change in Company Sponsor
 
DarkPulse became the Sponsor of GSD to take advantage of the popularity of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies to facilitate a listing on a major stock exchange like Nasdaq. By consummating the business combination with GSD, DarkPulse can also benefit from GSD’s existing public market listing and the investor base that comes with it. This can help DarkPulse access new sources of capital, increase liquidity for its shares, and gain greater visibility in the marketplace. Landing on a major stock exchange like Nasdaq, DarkPulse can gain access to a larger pool of institutional and retail investors who may be interested in investing in the company. This can help to increase the company's market capitalization, improve its credibility with investors, and ultimately drive long-term growth and value creation for its shareholders. Regardless of the number redemptions which will likely decrease the cash held in GSD’s Trust Account, these benefits significant and a reason for DarkPulse to help GSD facilitate a business combination, including entering into the Support Agreement.
Purchase Agreement
 
On October 12, 2022, we entered into and closed a Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with our Original Sponsor, and our Sponsor, pursuant to which the new Sponsor purchased from the Original Sponsor 2,623,120 shares of our Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 4,298,496 Private Placement Warrants, each of which is exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,500,000 (the “Purchase Price”).
 
In addition to the payment of the Purchase Price, the Sponsor also assumed the following obligations: (i) responsibility for all of our public company reporting obligations, (ii) the right to provide an extension payment and extend the deadline of to complete an initial business combination from 15 months from November 9, 2022 to 18 months at February 9, 2023, for an additional $1,150,000, and (iii) all other obligations and liabilities of the Original Sponsor related to our company.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor has replaced our current directors and officers with directors and an officer selected in its sole discretion. In connection with the closing of the Agreement, we have changed our name to “Global Systems Dynamics, Inc.”
 
In addition to the Agreement, our Sponsor also entered into the Assignment, Assumption, Release and Waiver of the Letter Agreement pursuant to which the Original Sponsor and each of the parties to the Letter Agreement (defined below) agreed that all rights, interests and obligations of the Original Sponsor under the Letter Agreement (as defined below) were hereby assigned to the Sponsor and that the Original Sponsor will have no further rights, interests or obligations under the Letter Agreement as of the Closing Date.
 
The letter agreement dated August 4, 2021 (the “Letter Agreement”), was by and among the Original Sponsor, et. al., and delivered to us in accordance with an Underwriting Agreement, dated August 4, 2021 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), entered into by and among our company and EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC, as representative of the underwriters, et. al.
 
Finally, in addition to the Agreement, the Sponsor entered into the Joinder to the Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to become a party to the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of August 4, 2021 by and among our company, the Original Sponsor, et. al.

Support Agreements
 
On October 12, 2022, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, we and the Original Sponsor terminated the administrative support agreement dated August 4, 2021.
 
On October 12, 2022, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Support Agreement”) with the Sponsor that commenced on the date the Original Sponsor sold all of its securities in our company in connection with the aforementioned Purchase Agreement. Under the Sponsor Agreement, the new Sponsor shall make available, or cause to be made available, to us, at 815 Walker Street, Suite 114, Houston, Texas 77002 (or any successor location of Darkpulse), certain office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support as may be reasonably required by us. In exchange, we shall pay the new Sponsor the sum of $10,000 per month.
 
Additionally, our Compensation Committee has agreed to compensate our sole executive officer and board members with $10,000 monthly for their services, commencing October 2022. 
 
Further under the Support Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to waive any and all claims to seek payment of any amounts due to it out of the trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders.
 
Indemnity Agreements
 
We have also entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We have directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.
 
These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.
 
We believe that these provisions, the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.
 
Funding for Extension and Working Capital
 
On November 2, 2022, February 7, 2023, March 9, 2023, April 7, 2023 and May 5, 2023, we issued notes to our Sponsor in connection with the extension of the termination date for our Business Combination from November 9, 2022 to February 9, 2023, from February 9, 2023 to March 9, 2023, from March 9, 2023 to April 9, 2023, from April 9, 2023 to May 9, 2023 and from May 9, 2023 to June 9, 2023, respectively.
 
Pursuant to the notes, the Sponsor has agreed to loan to us $1,049,248, and $83,947.13, $83,947.13, $83,947.13 and $83,947.13, respectively, and deposited the funds into our trust account. The notes bear no interest and are repayable in full upon the earlier of (i) the date on which we consummate a Business Combination, and (ii) the date that our winding up is effective. At the election of the Sponsor and subject to certain conditions, all of the unpaid principal amount of the $1,150,000 note may be converted into Conversion Units upon consummation of the Business Combination with the total Conversion Units so issued shall be equal to: (x) the portion of the principal amount of the Note being converted divided by (y) the conversion price of ten dollars ($10.00), rounded up to the nearest whole number of units. The four $83,947 Notes totaling $335,788 are not convertible. 
 
We have non-interest-bearing advances due to our New Sponsor in the principal amount of $998,677 as of April 30, 2023.

Entry into Business Combination Agreement with DarkPulse
 
On December 14, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “BCA”) by and among our company, Zilla Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and DarkPulse, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Sponsor” or “DarkPulse”). Pursuant to the terms of the BCA, a business combination between us and DarkPulse will be effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into DarkPulse, with DarkPulse surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). Our board of directors has (i) approved and declared advisable the BCA, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the BCA and related transactions by our stockholders.
 
Pursuant to the BCA, “Merger Consideration” includes DarkPulse Common Stock and DarkPulse Common Stock that results from the conversion of the DarkPulse Preferred Stock, a number of shares of GSD shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. “Exchange Ratio” is (a) the Equity Value Per Share (as defined below), divided by (b) the GSD Share Value (as defined in the BCA). “Equity Value Per Share” means (a) the Equity Value (as defined below), divided by (b) the Fully Diluted Company Capitalization (as defined in the BCA). “Equity Value” is $116,518,357.65. Based on the values of the inputs in the aforementioned formula as of April 28, 2023, some of which are variable up until the day the BCA closes, DarkPulse shareholders will receive 1 share of GSD Common Stock for every 722 shares of DarkPulse Common Stock. In sum, DarkPulse’s common stock has a market value of $0.0055 as of April 28, 2023, thus, DarkPulse shareholders will receive 1 share of GSD Common Stock, valued at $10.00 pursuant to the BCA, for every 722 of their DarkPulse common stock, valued at approximately $2.88.


 The transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, and the other transactions contemplated by the other transaction documents contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (collectively, the “Proposed Business Combination”) will constitute a “Business Combination” as contemplated by the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Business Combination and the transactions contemplated thereby were unanimously approved by the board of directors of the Company on December 14, 2022.
 
The Business Combination
 
The BCA provides, among other things, that Merger Sub will merge with and into DarkPulse, with DarkPulse as the surviving company in the merger and, after giving effect to such merger, the Company shall be a wholly-owned subsidiary of GSD. GSD will continue to be named “Global System Dynamics, Inc.” and the combined entity will trade under the symbol “DARK.”
 
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the BCA, at the Effective Time, among other things: (i) each GSD Class A Share and each GSD Class B Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger will become one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of GSD; (ii) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or any other Person, each DarkPulse Share (other than DarkPulse Shares cancelled and extinguished pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(viii) of the BCA) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive that number of GSD Class A Shares equal to the Merger Consideration; provided, however, that any DarkPulse shares that are Restricted Shares shall be converted into restricted GSD Class A Shares, subject to the same vesting, transfer and other restrictions as the applicable Restricted Shares; (iii) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or any other Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.0001, of DarkPulse; (vi) Dennis O’Leary, Joseph Catalino, George Pappas, Geoff Mullins, Wayne Bale and John Bartrum shall become the directors of GSD, Dennis O’Leary shall become the Chief Executive Officer of GSD and of the Surviving Company, and J. Richard Iler shall become the Chief Financial Officer of GSD, each to hold office in accordance with the Governing Documents of GSD until such director’s or officer’s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal; (v) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or any other Person, each DarkPulse share held immediately prior to the Effective Time by DarkPulse as treasury stock shall be automatically canceled and extinguished, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto.
 
The Business Combination is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2023 but in no event later than August 9, 2023, following the receipt of the required approval by the stockholders of DarkPulse and our company, approval by the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) of our initial listing application filed in connection with the Business Combination, the fulfillment of other customary closing conditions and the effectiveness of the Form S-4 registration statement the Company filed with the SEC.

The Company Stockholder Transaction Support Agreement
 
Concurrently with, or with respect to a certain stockholder holding all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock of DarkPulse, within a specified time after the signing of the BCA, the “DarkPulse Stockholder” listed on Schedule I attached to the BCA (collectively, the “Supporting Company Stockholder”) shall duly execute and deliver to GSD a transaction support agreement (the “The Company Stockholder Transaction Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, such Supporting DarkPulse Stockholder will agree to, support and vote in favor of the BCA, the Ancillary Documents to which DarkPulse is or will be a party and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Merger).
Extension of Date to Consummation a Business Combination
 
On January 31, 2023, at the Special Meeting, a total of 10,079,383 (or 75.64%) of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock held of record as of December 21, 2022, the record date for the Special Meeting, were present either in person or by proxy, which constituted a quorum. Our stockholders voted at the Special Meeting to approve an Extension Amendment to our charter to extend the time to complete a business combination, with more than 65% voting for approval.
 
On January 31, 2023, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which we must consummate a Business Combination up to six times, each by an additional month, for an aggregate of six additional months (i.e. from February 9, 2023 up to August 9, 2023) or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires that we provide our public stockholders an opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in connection with an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the time in which to consummate a Business Combination. The January 31, 2023 Special meeting requested shareholder approval of the Extension amendment, and thus triggered the requirement in our charter to provide its public shareholders an opportunity to redeem their Public Shares. In connection with the Special Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment, we afforded our stockholders an opportunity to redeem their Public Shares and stockholders holding 9,149,326 Public Shares (approximately 87% of the outstanding Public Shares) properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.39 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $95,061,497. Following such redemptions, approximately $14,038,481 was left in trust and 1,343,154 Public Shares remain outstanding.

Business Strategy
 
If the Proposed Business Combination with DarkPulse does not become effective, our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, to build a company in an industry or sector that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from our operational expertise. Our acquisition selection process will leverage our team’s network of potential transaction sources, ranging from owners and directors of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, lenders, attorneys, accountants and other trusted advisors across various sectors.
 
In addition, we intend to utilize the networks and industry experience of each of directors in seeking an initial business combination. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and board have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities.
 
This network has been developed through years of business experience, including in private equity and investment banking. We expect this network will provide our management team and board with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Members of our management team and board will communicate with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potentially interesting leads.


Acquisition Criteria
 
The Proposed Business Combination is not guaranteed to occur, and in such event, we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate an appropriate target business or that we will be able to engage in a business combination with target businesses on favorable terms. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use one or more of these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:
 1.       fitting the farming and national securities industries criteria we were targeting;
 2.       having a fair value in excess of the initial business combination minimum requirement of $82 million (80% of the IPO amount);
 3.       having a management team with the desire and ability to run a public company; and,
 4.       being ready (or able to get ready in short order) to meet the SEC’s merger prospectus requirements of such as having two years of audited financial statements.
 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Our initial business combination, whether effectuated through the Proposed Business Combination as set forth above or another business combination if the Proposed Business Combination does not occur, must comply with Nasdaq rules. Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any Initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

We have until June 9, 2023 (which is 22 months from the closing of the initial public offering) to consummate an Initial Business Combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our Initial Business Combination within 22 months, we will, by resolution of our board if requested by our Sponsor, extend the deadline to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional month for an aggregate of two months, or until August 9, 2023 (for a total of 24 months to complete a business combination), subject to the Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account as set out below. In connection with any such extension, public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our Initial Business Combination for an additional month and each month thereafter, our Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $0.0625 per public share remaining after redemptions on or prior to the date of the deadline. We will only be able to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination one month at a time and no more than two months total from June 9, 2023. We will issue a press release announcing any extension, at least three days prior to the deadline. In addition, we will issue a press release the day after the deadline, announcing whether the funds have been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are obligated to fund the Trust Account in order to extend the time for us to complete our Initial Business Combination, but our Sponsor will not be obligated to extend such time.


We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an Initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Initial Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test. If the Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the Initial Business Combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
To the extent we effect our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Our Business Combination Process
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that our Initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own shares of our common stock and/or Private Warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our Initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination.
 
Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity. We expect that if an opportunity is presented to one of our officers or directors in his or her capacity as an officer or director of one of those other entities, such opportunity would be presented to such other entity and not to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination.

Sourcing and Efforts with Potential Initial Business Combination Targets 
 Certain members of our prior management team have spent significant portions of their careers working with businesses in the farming and agricultural sectors, including farming related operations and businesses that support the farming industry, and have developed a wide network of professional services contacts and business relationships in that industry. The members of our prior board of directors also have significant executive management and public company experience with farming and agricultural related companies and brought additional relationships that further broadened our industry network.
 Our Original Sponsor (a subsidiary of The Gladstone Companies, Inc., or “TGCI”) drew upon the management expertise of employees of another of TGCI’s subsidiaries to identify potential targets. That subsidiary, Gladstone Management Corporation, had a team assigned to identify, acquire and manage farmland assets on behalf of a company that it advises, Gladstone Land Corporation (a publicly-traded farmland REIT) (“Land”). Since Land is restricted by REIT rules from owning operating assets, the investment hypothesis relating to the original formation of GSD was that the Sponsor could draw on the expertise of the Land team in identifying businesses in farming and agricultural sectors, including farming related operations and businesses that support the farming industry, that would be potential investment targets for GLEE which Land was not itself interested in owning.
 Over the period from the closing of the IPO in August 2021 until our Sponsor sold its interests in our Company to DarkPulse in October 2022, the team met at least weekly and evaluated over 50 potential target companies. The challenge was finding companies that fit the overall criteria including:
 1.       fitting the farm and farming-related asset criteria we were targeting;
 2.       having a fair value in excess of the initial business combination minimum requirement of $82 million (80% of the IPO amount);
 3.       having a management team with the desire and ability to run a public company; and,
 4.       being ready (or able to get ready in short order) to meet the SEC’s merger prospectus requirements of such as having two years of audited financial statements.
 The Company conducted due diligence to varying degrees on the potential targets, including review of the business’ management, balance sheet, valuation, business model, stockholders, and historical and projected financials, in each case to the extent made available, among other diligence reviews. Following such reviews, and at various points in time, the Company decided to discontinue discussions with the potential targets other than DarkPulse, for one or several reasons, including preparedness for the public markets, growth potential, total addressable market, end market focus, capital requirements, market position, defensibility of business strategy, valuation, and industry trends among other reasons.
 Discussion of Valuation and Reasons for the Approval of the Proposed Business Combination
 
Soon after the change in our Board of Directors in October of 2022, the new Board began holding regular Board meetings with key meetings, decision and events identified below. The focus of the Board meetings was due diligence on a potential target company, DarkPulse. The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation or meeting among the Board, but instead is meant to provide a synopsis of events to better understand why the Board approved the Proposed Business Combination.
 
A meeting was held November 29, 2022, at which our Board discussed the following:
 

· | The Board held a lengthy discussion concerning its fiduciary responsibilities in connection with a SPAC company and business combination with a deadline of February 9, 2023, including the due diligence involved in what the prior sponsor and management had already accomplished since inception, due diligence of the current target company under a letter of intent at the time with DarkPulse, Inc., and finally whether another company would provide a better opportunity for stockholders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board discussed the time available to complete a business combination and the legal process and logistics involved in conducting a special meeting of stockholders to consider whether to approve an extension of the deadline to complete a business combination. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the discussion on the points above, our Board resolved that management would prepare documents for a potential extension of the deadline to complete a business combination from February 9, 2023 to August 9, 2023 with appropriate considerations as to why an extension is necessary for the Board to consider at its next meeting.
 
Furthermore, our Board established procedures for conducting due diligence including:
 

· | The Board discussed procedurally how to engage in due diligence with respect to what the Original Sponsor and management of the Company had already accomplished along with completing a new due diligence checklist for DarkPulse to complete.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board resolved that our CFO shall take steps to obtain information on what the Original Sponsor and management had accomplished since inception of the Company to October 12, 2022, the date of the sponsor and management change.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board further resolved that outside counsel shall liaison with counsel for DarkPulse on outstanding due diligence items and to submit questions from the Board and management for follow up pertaining to the information received under the checklist.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board further resolved that the entire Board at the next meeting shall consider what additional professionals will be required, including a budget, to complete due diligence.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A meeting was held December 2, 2022, at which our Board discussed the following:
 

· | Approval of Board and Chief Financial Officer Compensation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Examination and approval of GSD expenses and creation of a budget for due diligence.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A review and discussion of due diligence exercised by the previous board and criteria used with regard to past candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Filing a Schedule 14A and holding a special meeting to extend the deadline for a business combination by two three month periods ending on August 9, 2023, with the Sponsor making deposits into the Trust Account at each three month extension.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A meeting was held December 6, 2022, at which our Board discussed the following:
 

· | The Board discussed company expenses and the restrictions on what the offering trust funds may be used for. Without trust funds, all due diligence, board and officer compensation will need to be paid from working capital loans from the target/sponsor. The Board discussed the limited availability of financing for DarkPulse, which had an equity line that may not be able to generate funds sufficient both for itself and to lend to our company, and how that may affect our company’s ability to pay vendors for services we would need performed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board discussed developing a set of criteria based on the current farming set of criteria but expanded to include national security industries. The current set of criteria is as follows:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1.       fitting the farm and farming-related asset criteria we were targeting;
 2.       having a fair value in excess of the initial business combination minimum requirement of $82 million (80% of the IPO amount);
 3.       having a management team with the desire and ability to run a public company; and,
 4.       being ready (or able to get ready in short order) to meet the SEC’s merger prospectus requirements of such as having two years of audited financial statements.
 

· | The Board approved developing a set of criteria based on the past farming set of criteria but expanded to include national security industries. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Discussion related to interfacing with DarkPulse on the company’s due diligence requests. Suggestion to invite DarkPulse to attend next meeting to have a presentation of due diligence on matters under the checklist. Also necessary is a timeline of events from counsel to meet the deadline that may be shared with DarkPulse.

A meeting was held December 13, 2022, at which our Board discussed the following:
 

· | The Board held discussion on the capital structure of DarkPulse, with emphasis on the classes of preferred stock designated and outstanding. The Board worked through questions on the reports for Series A Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, and was satisfied with the explanations provided by DarkPulse.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board held discussion on Dennis’ large conversion right under Series A Preferred stock at 25% of the outstanding on an as-diluted basis. The Board felt that the large amount could be a concern. The Board considered Dennis’ contributions to the company and was informed of the litigation involving the Series D Preferred Stock, all of which factors helped to alleviate the concern.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board held discussion on outstanding litigation and in particular the convertible note litigation. While these actions are a concern, the Board determined that these risks are existing and will be fully disclose as risk factors if the Board presents the deal for stockholder approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board held discussion on DarkPulse’s financials and projections.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board held discussion on Optilon and its cash drain to the company. GSD’s officer noted that the company is expected to make a turn next year.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board held a discussion on completing due diligence. A motion was made to conclude due diligence after receiving the various responses and submissions from DarkPulse,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board resolved to conclude due diligence of DarkPulse, to hold a meeting with Benchmark the following day to go over the financial analysis in connection with the fairness opinion, and to consider approving the BCA at the next Board meeting after the review of the financial analysis in connection with the fairness opinion and discussion with Benchmark.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A meeting was held December 14, 2022, at which the GSD Board discussed the following:
 

· | Representatives of Benchmark reviewed the financial analysis in connection with the fairness opinion and rendered an oral opinion to our Board, subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date by delivery of Benchmark’s written opinion addressed to our Board, to the effect that the consideration to be paid in the Business Combination pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, is fair from a financial point of view to the unaffiliated stockholders of the company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Additionally, as part of their review of the financial analysis in connection with the fairness opinion, representatives of Benchmark also reviewed with the Board an analysis of the recent market valuations of DarkPulse, which Benchmark merely reviewed but did not rely upon in reaching the conclusion expressed in its Opinion. This review examined DarkPulse’s market valuations based on its closing stock price and 30-day VWAP (volume weighted average price) as of December 13, 2022, and compared the premiums to these market valuations implied by the merger consideration to the average and median premiums paid in the acquisition of OTC-traded technology companies over the last three years. DarkPulse’s market valuation was not a primary consideration for the Board since the Board did not view the market valuation of an OTC-traded stock to be efficient and necessarily reflective of the underlying fundamental value of DarkPulse.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board asked questions of the representatives of Benchmark at the meeting about the financial analysis in connection with the fairness opinion. The Board then dismissed Benchmark from the remainder of the meeting.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board further discussed the issue of DarkPulse’s financials and projections. The Board held discussion on the IP for DarkPulse, the various agreements, as well as pending agreements and the commercialization of the IP in the market. The Board noted that there has not been challenges to the DarkPulse IP.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board held discussion on the projections used in the financial analysis in connection with the fairness opinion and discussed pending contracts of DarkPulse and other matters related to financial performance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Board resolved to accept the fairness opinion, with notes to Benchmark to update the current amount of cash in trust and anticipated transaction expenses in its final analysis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also at the December 14, 2022 board meeting, our Board noted that it is empowered with a wide mandate to not only consider the target for a Business Combination, but also whether the proposed terms of the merger are advisable or whether the terms need to be negotiated and/or revised or whether the needs of the stockholders of our Company would be better served by alternative transactions that are available to us.
 
The Board held discussion on past efforts of the Original Sponsor and management team to secure a business combination with a company in the farming industry, with many candidates interviewed and considered. The Board noted its change to the criteria used to locate a suitable merger candidate to include the farming industry and the national security industry, with DarkPulse engaged in business operations designed to serve both industries. The Board reviewed a timeline prepared by counsel to effectuate a Business Combination and considered proposed SEC rules on SPACS to complete within 24 months. The Board concluded that the plan should be to complete a Business Combination, if warranted, within 24 months from the IPO. The Board noted the time remaining to complete a business combination at February 9, 2023, and decided that it should focus on whether DarkPulse is a suitable candidate as a target that would be in the best interests of stockholders.
 
The Board and counsel went over the material terms of the Business Combination Agreement by, between, and among the Company, the Merger Sub and DarkPulse, pursuant to which DarkPulse will merge with and into the Merger Sub with DarkPulse as the surviving company and DarkPulse shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of GSD.
 
The Board had considered, among other things, the presentations and representations by the officers of the DarkPulse, the review by Benchmark of its financial analysis and fairness opinion, the due diligence conducted by us on DarkPulse, the legal memos prepared by counsel, and such other factors as our Board has deemed relevant in connection with making a decision on the matter.
 
After considering the foregoing and holding a discussion on the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, our Board deemed it to be advisable and in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders to enter into the Business Combination Agreement and to recommend it to stockholders.
 
Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following an Initial Business Combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A Common Stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A Common Stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.
 Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an Initial Business Combination with us.
 Furthermore, once a proposed Initial Business Combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an IPO is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the IPO, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the IPO from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an Initial Business Combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

--


While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed Initial Business Combination, negatively.
 
Financial Position
 
We had funds available for an Initial Business Combination initially in the amount of approximately $108.8 million that was in the Trust Account as of December 31, 2022. However, on January 31, 2023, we held a Special Meeting of the stockholders to vote upon an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the time in which to consummate an Initial Business Combination, which we refer to as the Extension Amendment.

In connection with the Extension Amendment, stockholders holding 9,149,326 Public Shares (approximately 87% of the outstanding Public Shares) properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.39 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $95,061,497. Following such redemptions, approximately $14,038,481 was left in trust and 1,343,154 Public Shares remain outstanding. As of May 5, 2023, there was $14,400,067 in the Trust Account with 1,343,154 Public Shares outstanding. 

Despite the redemptions, we believe that we still offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our Initial Business Combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds held in the Trust Account from our IPO and the sale of the Private Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Class A Common Stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we can acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the Private Warrants, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed Initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In the case of an Initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the Initial Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or stock exchange requirements, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our Initial Business Combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.

Sources of Target Businesses 
 We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals, as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. Our officers and directors, as well as our Sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our Sponsor and their affiliates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our Initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated Initial Business Combination except as set forth herein. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our Initial Business Combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an Initial Business Combination candidate.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. The fair market value of our Initial Business Combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our Initial Business Combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will virtually have unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our Initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an Initial Business Combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. There is no basis for investors in our IPO to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our Initial Business Combination.
 

24
--


To the extent we effect our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an Initial Business Combination in a single industry. By completing our Initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our Initial Business Combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Initial Business Combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Initial Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination.
 
Following an Initial Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or applicable stock exchange listing requirements, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of Initial Business Combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

Type of transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the Company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the Company | No 
Merger of the Company with a target | Yes 

 
Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our Initial Business Combination if, for example:
 

• | we issue shares of Class A Common Stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The format for the Proposed Business Combination is merger of target into a subsidiary of the Company, and we have chosen to obtain shareholder approval.
 
Permitted Purchases of our Securities
 
If we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Initial Stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Initial Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our Initial Stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or Public Warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our Initial Business Combination.
 

26
--


The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the Initial Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of Public Warrants could be to reduce the number of Public Warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our Initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A Common Stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our Initial Business Combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our Initial Business Combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our Initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates will only purchase Public Shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect that any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A Common Stock upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account was approximately $10.39 per public share as of January 31, 2023 and approximately $10.43 as of March 31, 2023. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock held by them in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
 
Our public stockholders will retain their public warrants even if they redeem their Public Shares. If any of our public stockholders redeem their public shares at closing in accordance with the our charter but continue to hold public warrants after the closing, the 5,239,244 retained outstanding public Warrants would have an aggregate market value of approximately $360,450, based on the closing price on the Nasdaq of $0.0688 per Warrant as of April 28, 2023, regardless of the number of shares redeemed by public stockholders. Following the Business Combination, we may redeem outstanding warrants prior to their expiration at a time that is disadvantageous to the holder thereof, or the warrants may never be in the money and may expire worthless. Please see “Risk Factors” — "Even if we consummate the Business Combination, the Public Warrants may never be in the money, and they may expire worthless” and “We may redeem the unexpired redeemable Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to Warrant holders, thereby making their Public Warrants worthless” for more information.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares of Class A Common Stock upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an Initial Business Combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed Initial Business Combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules.

27
--


If stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

· | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------



In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Initial Business Combination.

If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present and entitled to vote at the meeting to approve the Initial Business Combination when a quorum is present are voted in favor of the Initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Initial Stockholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter agreements, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any shares of Class B Common Stock held by them and any shares of Class A Common Stock acquired during or after our IPO (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our Initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our Initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, with the 2,623,120 shares of Class B Common stock held by our Initial Stockholders with their intention to vote in favor of the Business Combination , we would not need any of the 1,343,154 public shares outstanding to be voted in favor of an Initial Business Combination (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted) in order to have our Initial Business Combination approved (assuming that the Initial Stockholders do not purchase any Units or shares in the after-market after the date of this Annual Report). We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our Initial Business Combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our Initial Stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our Initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction, whether they participate in or abstain from voting or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

· | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our Initial Business Combination, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, we will not redeem any public shares unless our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we might withdraw the tender offer and not complete the Initial Business Combination.



28
--


Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may not redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. For example, the proposed Initial Business Combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we might not complete the Initial Business Combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A Common Stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.


Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Initial Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an Initial Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination.
 
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with Redemption Rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the Initial Business Combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have up to two days prior to the vote on the Initial Business Combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 

29
--


The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many special purpose acquisition companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an Initial Business Combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed Initial Business Combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the Initial Business Combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the Initial Business Combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the Initial Business Combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the Initial Business Combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date of the stockholder meeting. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
 
If our Initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed Initial Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an Initial Business Combination with a different target until 22 months from the closing of our IPO (or 24 months from the closing of our IPO, if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account and our approving the extensions).
 
Extension of Time to Complete Business Combination
 
We have until June 9, 2023, 22 months from the closing of our IPO to consummate an Initial Business Combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our Initial Business Combination within 22 months, we will, by resolution of our board if requested by our Sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional four times, each for a month for an aggregate of four months (for a total of 24 months to complete a business combination), subject to the Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account as set out below. In connection with any such extension, public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares. Pursuant to the terms of our certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our Initial Business Combination for an additional month, our Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $0.0625 per share of Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption on or prior to the date of the deadline. We will only be able to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination a month at a time, for an additional two months in the aggregate from June 9, 2023 to August 9, 2023. We will issue a press release announcing any extension, at least three days prior to the deadline. In addition, we will issue a press release the day after the deadline, announcing whether the funds have been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are obligated to fund the Trust Account in order to extend the time for us to complete our Initial Business Combination, but our Sponsor will not be obligated to extend such time.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have only 24 months from the closing of our IPO (subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account and our Board approving the extensions) to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within such period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income and franchise taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the 19-month time period (subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account).
 
Our Sponsor, Representative, officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any shares of Class B Common Stock held by them if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within 22 months from the closing of our IPO (or 24 months from the closing of our IPO, subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account). However, if our Sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after our IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within 22 months from the closing of our IPO (or 24 months from the closing of our IPO, if subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account).
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our Initial Business Combination or certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO (subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A Common Stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time.

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the Trust Account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay income and franchise taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.

Initially, if we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the Private Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.20. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.20. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our IPO, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account.
 
In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
 In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.20 per public share.

We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to the sale of the Private Warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our IPO expenses exceed our estimate of $550,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the Trust Account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the Trust Account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the IPO expenses are less than our estimate of $550,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the Trust Account would increase by a corresponding amount.


Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO (subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account) may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO (subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account), is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO (subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month (subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account and Board approval of the extensions) and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.20 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our Initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our Initial Business Combination or certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO (subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account and out board approving the extensions) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Initial Business Combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO (subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account), subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the Initial Business Combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote.
 
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our IPO that will apply to us until the completion of our Initial Business Combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of at least 65% of our common stock. Our Initial Stockholders (excluding holders of the representative shares), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

· | If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within 22 months from the closing of our IPO (or 24 months from the closing of our IPO, if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account and our Board approving the extension), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay income and franchise our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law;

· | Prior to our Initial Business Combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote on any Initial Business Combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We have entered into an Initial Business Combination with a target business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our directors or our officers. We, or a committee of independent directors, obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an Initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If a stockholder vote on our Initial Business Combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act; whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above;

· | So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination;

· | We will not effectuate our Initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions. This may not be waived.
 
Competition
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the Initial Business Combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants and rights, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination.

Employees
 We currently have one officer. This individual is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of his time as he deems necessary, in the exercise of his business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time our officer will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the Initial Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.
 We have arranged for compensation to our sole officer and each of our directors of $10,000 per month commencing October 2022.
 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our Units, Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statements requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an Initial Business Combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our Initial Business Combination.
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

--


We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time) or more during such fiscal year, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A Common Stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
Legal Proceedings 
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
