ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
Our Company 
We are one of the largest restaurant companies in the United States and have been operating restaurants for more than 60 years. We are the largest Burger King® franchisee in the United States, based on number of restaurants, and have operated Burger King restaurants since 1976. As of January 3, 2021, we operated 1,009 Burger King® restaurants located in 23 Northeastern, Midwestern, Southcentral and Southeastern states and 65 Popeyes® restaurants in seven Southeastern states. 
For a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, please refer to "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
Burger King. Burger King restaurants feature the popular flame-broiled Whopper® sandwich, as well as a variety of hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, salads, breakfast items, snacks, soft drinks and other offerings. We believe that our size, seasoned management team, extensive operating infrastructure, experience and proven operating disciplines differentiate us from many of our competitors as well as many other Burger King operators. 
According to RBI, as of December 31, 2020 there were a total of 18,625 Burger King restaurants, of which almost all were franchised and 7,081 were located in the United States. Burger King is the second largest quick service hamburger restaurant chain in the world (as measured by number of restaurants) and we believe that the Burger King brand is one of the world's most recognized consumer brands. Burger King restaurants have a distinctive image and are generally located in high-traffic areas throughout the United States. Burger King restaurants are designed to appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers, with multiple day-part meal segments targeted to different groups of consumers. We believe that the competitive attributes of Burger King restaurants include significant brand recognition, convenience of location, quality, speed of service and price.
We operate our restaurants under franchise agreements with BKC. Our Burger King restaurants are typically open seven days per week and generally have operating hours ranging from 6:00 am to midnight on Sunday to Wednesday and to 1:00AM on Thursday to Saturday. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, we reduced operating hours at many of our Burger King restaurants, primarily breakfast and late night. By the end of 2020, we had restored operating hours at our Burger King restaurants with the exception of late night, where we are closing a few hours earlier than pre-pandemic operations due to decreased local demand. 
Our existing restaurants consist of one of several building types with various seating capacities. Our typical freestanding restaurant contains approximately 2,600 square feet with seating capacity for 60 to 70 guests, has drive-thru service windows and adjacent parking areas. As of January 3, 2021, almost all of our restaurants were freestanding. 
Popeyes. Popeyes Restaurants are quick-service restaurants offering primarily a limited menu of lunch and dinner products, and in certain restaurants breakfast products. Popeyes distinguishes itself with a unique “Louisiana” style menu that features a fried chicken sandwich, spicy chicken, chicken tenders, biscuits, fried shrimp and other seafood, red beans and rice and other quick-service menu items. According to RBI, as of December 31, 2020, there were 3,451 Popeyes restaurants worldwide and 2,608 Popeyes restaurants in the United States. 
Our Popeyes restaurants are generally freestanding locations with approximately 2,500 to 3,200 square feet with seating capacity for 50 to 60 guests and a drive-thru. Our Popeyes restaurants are typically open seven days per week with operating hours of 10:00 am to 10:00 pm Sunday through Thursday and 10:00 am to 11:00 pm on Friday and Saturday. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, we reduced operating hours at many of our Popeyes restaurants, primarily late night. By the end of 2020, we had restored operating hours at our Popeyes restaurants with the exception of a few locations where we are still closing a few hours earlier than pre-pandemic operations due to decreased local demand. 
During 2019, we acquired 234 restaurants in three separate transactions. During 2018, we acquired a total of 44 restaurants from other franchisees in four separate transactions. During 2017, we acquired a total of 64 restaurants in three separate transactions.
For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, our restaurants generated total restaurant sales of $1,547.5 million, which included $28.4 million from the 53rd week in 2020 and was impacted by significant sales declines we experienced in March (-16.8%) and April (-21.7%) of 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2020, comparable restaurant sales at our Burger King restaurants decreased 2.8% and at our Popeyes restaurants decreased 0.1%. Our average annual restaurant sales for all restaurants were approximately $1.4 million per restaurant in fiscal 2020.
 2019 Cambridge Acquisition. On April 30, 2019, we completed a merger with New CFH, a former subsidiary of Cambridge Franchise Holdings, LLC ("Cambridge"), and acquired 165 Burger King® restaurants, 55 Popeyes® restaurants and six convenience stores (the "Cambridge Acquisition"). Cambridge received a total of approximately 14.9 million shares of our common stock, after the automatic conversion of 10,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock that Cambridge initially received in the Cambridge Acquisition. All shares of common stock issued to Cambridge are subject to a two year restriction on sale or transfer subject to certain limited exceptions. As part of the transaction, Cambridge designated two Cambridge executives who joined the Company's Board of Directors upon completion of the Cambridge Acquisition.
Area Development Agreements. The Company, Carrols, Carrols LLC and BKC entered into a new Area Development Agreement (the "ADA") which commenced on April 30, 2019 and was to end on September 30, 2024 and which superseded the Operating Agreement dated as of May 30, 2012, as amended, between Carrols LLC and BKC. The ADA was amended and restated by all parties on January 4, 2021 (the "Amended ADA"). 
Under the ADA, Carrols LLC had agreed to open, build and operate a total of 200 new Burger King restaurants including 32 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2020, 41 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2021, 41 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2022, 40 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2023 and 39 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2024, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the ADA. Carrols LLC had also agreed under the ADA to remodel or upgrade a total of 748 Burger King restaurants to BKC’s Burger King of Tomorrow restaurant image, including 130 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2020, 118 additional Burger King restaurants by September 
30, 2021, 131 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2022, 138 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2023 and 141 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2024, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the ADA. 
These development commitments were substantially reduced in the Amended ADA. Pursuant to the Amended ADA, Carrols LLC agreed to open, build and operate a total of 50 new Burger King restaurants, 80% of which must be in Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana. This includes four Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2021, 10 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2022, 12 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2023, 12 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2024 and 12 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2025. 
In addition, pursuant to the Amended ADA, BKC granted Carrols LLC franchise pre-approval to build new Burger King restaurants or acquire Burger King restaurants from Burger King franchisees with respect to 500 Burger King restaurants in the aggregate in (i) Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana (excluding certain geographic areas in Indiana) and (ii) (a) 16 states, which include Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia (subject to certain exceptions for certain limited geographic areas within certain states) and (b) any other geographic locations that Carrols LLC enters after the commencement date of the Amended ADA pursuant to BKC procedures subject to certain limitations.
Pursuant to the ADA and for a cost of $3.0 million, BKC had assigned to Carrols LLC the right of first refusal on the sale of franchisee-operated restaurants in 16 states and a limited number of counties in four additional states, and granted franchise pre-approval to acquire Burger King restaurants until the date that we have acquired more than an aggregate of an additional 500 Burger King restaurants excluding those restaurants we acquired in the Cambridge Acquisition ("ADA ROFR"). The ADA ROFR was terminated in connection with the Amended ADA and an impairment charge of $2.0 million for the unamortized value remaining from the payment for the ADA ROFR was recorded in 2020. 
BKC agreed to contribute $10 million to $12 million for upgrades of approximately 50 to 60 Burger King restaurants in 2019 and 2020 where BKC is the landlord on the lease for such Burger King restaurants operated by Carrols LLC or an affiliate. Most of these restaurants had already been remodeled to the 20/20 image. We received $10.0 million from BKC under this arrangement in 2019. 
On October 1 of each year following the commencement date of the ADA, Carrols LLC was required to pay BKC pre-paid franchise fees in the following amounts to be applied to new Burger King restaurants opened and operated by Carrols LLC: (a) $350,000 on the commencement date of the ADA, (b) $1,600,000 on October 1, 2019, (c) $2,050,000 on October 1, 2020, (d) $2,050,000 on October 1, 2021, (e) $2,000,000 on October 1, 2022 and (f) $1,950,000 on October 1, 2023. The Amended ADA eliminated the requirement for any prepayments due and payable on and after October 1, 2020, and the $0.6 million balance of prepaid franchise fees paid under the ADA that had not yet been applied to new restaurant development was forfeited. 
Through the Cambridge Acquisition, we have also assumed a development agreement for Popeyes, which includes an assignment by PLK of its right of first refusal under its franchise agreements with its franchisees for acquisitions in two southern states, as well as a development commitment to open, build and operate approximately 80 new Popeyes® restaurants over six years.
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
Largest Burger King Franchisee in the United States. We are the largest Burger King franchisee in the United States based on number of restaurants, and believe we are well positioned to leverage the scale and marketing of one of the most recognized brands in the restaurant industry. We believe the geographic dispersion of our restaurants provides us with stability and enhanced growth opportunities in many of the markets in which we operate. We also believe that our large number of restaurants increases our ability to effectively manage the awareness of the Burger King brand in certain markets through our ability to influence local advertising and promotional activities. 
Operational Expertise. We have been operating Burger King restaurants since 1976 and have developed sophisticated information and operating systems that enable us to measure and monitor key metrics for operational performance, sales and profitability that may not be available to other restaurant operators. Our focus on leveraging our operational expertise, infrastructure and systems allows us to optimize the performance of our restaurants and restaurants that we may acquire or open. Our size and history with the Burger King brand enable us to effectively track operating metrics and leverage best practices across our organization. We believe that our experienced management team, operating culture, effective operating systems and infrastructure enable us to operate more efficiently than many other Burger King operators. We also believe we will be able to leverage our operational expertise to the Popeyes restaurants acquired in 2019.
Consistent Operating History and Financial Strength. We believe that the quality and sophistication of our restaurant operations have helped drive our strong restaurant level performance. Comparable restaurant sales for our restaurants have generally outperformed the Burger King system. Our strong restaurant level operations coupled with our financial management capabilities have resulted in consistent and stable cash flows under most economic circumstances. We have demonstrated our ability to prudently manage our capital structure and financial leverage through a variety of economic cycles. We believe that our cash flow from operations, cash balances and the availability of revolving credit borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities are sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and capital expenditures. 
Two Distinct Brands with Global Recognition, Innovative Marketing and New Product Development. As a Burger King franchisee, we benefit from, and rely on, BKC's extensive marketing, advertising and product development capabilities to drive sales and generate increased restaurant traffic. Over the years, BKC has launched innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns and products that highlight the relevance of the Burger King brand. BKC has also introduced promotions that leverage both value and premium menu offerings as well as providing a platform for new premium sandwich offerings. We believe these campaigns continue to positively impact the brand today as BKC focuses on offering a well-balanced value menu and premium sandwich promotional mix and remains committed to new product launches, including a new hand-breaded crispy chicken sandwich and limited time offers, both of which continue to show positive trends. BKC is also working with franchisees throughout the system to encourage the renovation and remodeling of restaurants to BKC's current image, which we believe will continue to increase customer traffic and restaurant sales. In 2020, BKC assisted with the Company’s launch of delivery options for our guests. BKC negotiated distribution and operational agreements with major delivery platform providers and introduced its own white label mobile application that allowed us to quickly provide this option to our guests. In 2021, BKC is launching a loyalty program for use by its franchisees that we believe will reduce coupon clutter and provide incentives for guests to visit our restaurants with greater frequency and during lower traffic periods.
With regard to the Popeyes brand, which is owned by PLK, a subsidiary of RBI, the successful development and launch of a new chicken sandwich in 2019 has not only driven higher sales but we believe has also attracted a new demographic of guests to the existing customer base which will enhance restaurant sales and new restaurant development opportunities. 
Strategic Relationship with Burger King Corporation and RBI. We believe that the structure of the 2012 acquisition of 278 restaurants from BKC and the 2019 Cambridge Acquisition strengthened our well-established relationship with BKC and RBI and has further aligned our common interests to grow our business. In 2021, we intend to continue to expand our restaurant base over the long term by making selective acquisitions under our pre-approval rights. The consideration to BKC associated with the 2012 acquisition included a preferred stock equity interest in Carrols Restaurant Group, which is held by BKC Stockholders (as defined below) and convertible into approximately 15.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (after giving effect to such conversion). Since the 2012 acquisition, two of BKC's or RBI's senior executives have served on our Board of Directors. Christopher Finazzo, President of BKC, Americas and Matthew Dunnigan, Chief Financial Officer of Restaurant Brands International Inc., the indirect parent company of BKC, currently serve on our Board of Directors. Our restaurants represented approximately 14.2% of the Burger King locations in the United States as of January 3, 2021. We believe that the combination of our rights under the Amended ADA, RBI's equity interest and its board level 
representation will continue to reinforce the alignment of our common interests with BKC and Popeyes over the long term.
Experienced Burger King Management Team with a Proven Track Record. We believe that our senior management team's extensive experience in the restaurant industry and its long and successful history of developing, acquiring, integrating and operating quick-service restaurants provide us with a competitive advantage. Our management team has a successful history of integrating acquired restaurants, and over the past 20 years, we have significantly increased the number of Burger King restaurants we own and operate, largely through acquisitions. Our operations are overseen by our Chief Executive Officer, Dan Accordino, who has over 45 years of Burger King and quick-service restaurant experience, and our new Chief Operating Officer, Carl Hauch, who joined us in February of 2021 and has over 20 years of experience in restaurant and retail operations, most recently in the Wendy's system. Additionally, we have two Burger King Divisional Vice Presidents and 13 Regional Directors that collectively have an average of 22 years of Burger King restaurant experience. Our 148 Burger King district managers, who have an average tenure of over 16 years in the Burger King system, support the Regional Directors. Our operations management is further supported by our infrastructure of financial, information systems, real estate, human resources and legal professionals. 
Multiple Growth Levers. We believe our historical track record of acquiring and integrating restaurants and our long-term strategy to remodel, upgrade and open new restaurants provide multiple avenues to grow our business. With more than 60 years of restaurant operating experience, we have successfully grown our business through acquisitions and integrated the restaurants we acquired. We have experienced increases in comparable restaurant sales, increased restaurant-level profitability and improved operating metrics at the restaurants we have acquired in the last five years. 
Our Business Strategies 
Our primary business strategies are as follows: 
Selectively Acquire and Develop Additional Burger King and Popeyes Restaurants. After enduring the challenges 2020 brought to our industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have substantially improved our liquidity position, we have reduced our near-term capital expenditure requirements and we continue to deleverage. As a result, we believe we have the flexibility to grow our business organically and through acquisitions in a manner that will optimize our growth potential while generating consistent and enhanced free cash flow and keeping our leverage in check. 
As of January 3, 2021, we operated 1,009 Burger King restaurants, making us the largest Burger King franchisee in the United States, and 65 Popeyes® restaurants. Under our Amended ADA with BKC, we are pre-approved to acquire up to 500 Burger King restaurants in territories where we currently operate and have agreed to build 50 new restaurants over the next five years. Due to the number of restaurants and franchisees in the Burger King system and our historical success in acquiring and integrating restaurants, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for future growth through acquisitions. There are more than 2,000 Burger King restaurants we do not own in states in which we have pre-approval rights. Furthermore, we believe there are additional Burger King restaurants in states beyond our territories that could be attractive acquisition candidates, subject to BKC's approval. 
While we may evaluate and discuss potential acquisitions of additional restaurants from time to time, we currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions. We may be required to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on acceptable terms or at all. 
Improve Profitability of Restaurants We Acquire by Leveraging Our Existing Infrastructure and Best-Practices. For acquired restaurants, we believe we can realize benefits from economies of scale, including leveraging our existing infrastructure across a larger number of restaurants. Additionally, we believe that our skilled management team, sophisticated information technology, operating systems and training and development programs support our ability to enhance operating margins at these restaurants. We have demonstrated our ability to increase 
the profitability of acquired restaurants and we believe that, over time, we will improve profitability and operational efficiency at the restaurants we have acquired and may acquire in the future.
Increase Restaurant Sales and Customer Traffic. BKC has identified and implemented a number of strategies to increase brand awareness, increase market share, improve overall operations and drive sales. These strategies are central to our strategic objectives to deliver profitable growth. 
•Products. The strength of the BKC menu has been built on a distinct flame-grilled cooking platform to make better tasting hamburgers. We believe that BKC intends to continue to optimize the menu by focusing on core products, such as the flagship Whopper® sandwich, while maintaining a balance between value promotions and premium limited time offerings to drive sales and traffic. Recent product innovation has included the new hand-breaded Chicken Sandwich and the Impossible Whopper, a vegetable based product that has attracted new customers. The new hand-breaded Chicken Sandwich is one of the largest anticipated product introductions to our menu. In addition, BKC has implemented a multi-tier balanced marketing approach with value and premium offerings, pairing value promotions with premium sandwich offerings. Promotional initiatives in 2020 included the 2 for $6 Mix and Match, the 2 for $5 Mix and Match, and the 2 for $4 and 2 for $5 Biscuit/Croissan'wich. In 2021, we are looking forward to a new Value Menu featuring the $1.00 Bacon Cheeseburger as well as the Sourdough platform which includes the Sourdough KING and a new Sourdough Breakfast Sandwich. BKC intends to accelerate the breakfast daypart with a new French Toast Sandwich. In 2021, BKC also intends to introduce a new loyalty program entitled “Royal Perks” to entice guests to visit more often and receive personalized offers. These new platforms in addition to recent quality improvements support BKC's strategy to appeal to a broader consumer base and to increase restaurant sales. 
•Image. We believe that re-imaged restaurants increase curb appeal and result in increased restaurant sales. BKC's current restaurant image features a fresh, sleek, eye-catching design which incorporates easy-to-navigate digital menu boards in the dining room, streamlined merchandising at the drive-thru and flat screen televisions in the dining area. We believe that restaurant remodeling has improved our guests' dining experience and increased customer traffic. We believe the customer experience will be further enhanced from the upgrades to the Burger King of Tomorrow image that include a double drive-thru (where applicable), certain modifications to the exterior image and the installation of exterior digital menu boards. 
•Advertising and Promotion. We believe that we will benefit from BKC's advertising support of its menu items, product enhancement and re-imaging initiatives. BKC has established a data driven marketing process which has focused on driving restaurant sales and traffic, while targeting a broad consumer base with inclusive messaging. This strategy uses multiple touch points to advertise our products, including digital advertising, social media and mobile display, in addition to traditional television advertising and streaming audio. BKC has a food-centric marketing strategy which focuses consumers on the food offerings, the core asset, and balances value promotions and premium limited time offerings to drive profitable restaurant sales and traffic. 
•Operations. We believe that improving restaurant operations and enhancing the customer experience are key components to increasing the profitability of our restaurants. We believe we will benefit from BKC's ongoing initiatives to improve food quality, simplify restaurant level execution, reduce restaurant labor costs and monitor operational performance, all of which are designed to improve the customer experience and increase customer traffic. In 2020, BKC implemented delivery services with major delivery providers as well as through its own mobile app. By the end of 2020, we were providing fully integrated delivery services at approximately 890 of our Burger King restaurants, based on the geographic availability of delivery services. 
Restaurant Economics 
Selected restaurant operating data for our restaurants is as follows: 

 | Year Ended 
 | December 30, 2018 | | December 29, 2019 | | January 3, 2021
Average annual sales per restaurant (1) | $ | 1,449,047 | | | $ | 1,454,654 | | | $ | 1,435,531
Average sales transaction | $ | 7.37 | | | $ | 7.62 | | | $ | 8.63 
Drive-through sales as a percentage of total sales | 68.4 | % | | 68.2 | % | | 86.1 | %
Day-part sales percentages: | | | | | 
Breakfast | 13.5 | % | | 13.0 | % | | 11.5 | %
Lunch | 31.9 | % | | 31.7 | % | | 32.6 | %
Dinner | 20.9 | % | | 21.5 | % | | 22.6 | %
Afternoon | 19.9 | % | | 20.1 | % | | 22.0 | %
Late night | 13.8 | % | | 13.7 | % | | 11.3 | %


(1)Average annual sales per restaurant are derived by dividing restaurant sales by the average number of restaurants operating during the period on a 52-week basis for the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 29, 2019 or 53-week basis for the year ended January 3, 2021.
Restaurant Capital Costs 
The initial cost of the franchise fee, equipment, seating, signage and other interior costs of a standard new Burger King and Popeyes restaurant currently is approximately $500,000 (which excludes the cost of land, the building and site improvements). In the markets in which we operate, the cost of land generally ranges from $500,000 to $1,200,000 for Burger King restaurants and $500,000 to $1,000,000 for Popeyes restaurants and the cost of building and site improvements generally ranges from $1,000,000 to $1,800,000 for both Burger King and Popeyes restaurants. 
With respect to the development of freestanding restaurants, if we acquire land and construct the building, we typically seek to thereafter enter into an arrangement to sell and leaseback the land and building under a long-term lease. Historically, we have been able to acquire and finance many of our locations under such leasing arrangements. Where we are unable to purchase the underlying land, we enter into a long-term lease for the land followed by construction of the building using cash generated from our operations or with borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below). 
The cost of securing real estate and developing and equipping new restaurants can vary significantly and depends on a number of factors, including local economic conditions and the characteristics of a particular site. Accordingly, the cost of opening new restaurants in the future may differ substantially from the historical cost of restaurants previously opened and the estimated costs above. 
BKC's current image restaurant design draws inspiration from its signature flame-grilled cooking process and incorporates a variety of innovative elements to a backdrop that evokes the warm and welcoming look of the outdoors including corrugated metal, brick, wood and concrete. The cost of remodeling a restaurant to the BKC current image varies depending upon the age and condition of the restaurant and the amount of new equipment needed and can range from $600,000 to $1,400,000 per restaurant with an average cost of approximately $1.1 million per restaurant in 2020. The total cost of a remodel has increased over time due to construction cost increases, the addition of a second drive-thru lane at certain locations and the replacement of certain kitchen equipment at the time of the remodel which is incremental to the cost to upgrade to the BKC current image design. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent and Future Events Affecting our Results of Operations".
Site Selection
We believe that the location of our restaurants is a critical component of each restaurant's success. We evaluate potential new sites on many critical criteria including accessibility, visibility, costs, surrounding traffic patterns, competition and demographic characteristics. Our senior management approves the viability of all acquisition prospects and new sites, based upon analyses prepared by our real estate, financial and operations professionals and our return on investment requirements.
Seasonality 
Our business is moderately seasonal due to regional weather conditions. Due to the location of our restaurants, sales are generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months.

Operations
Management Structure 
We conduct substantially all of our executive management, finance, marketing and operations support functions from our corporate headquarters in Syracuse, New York. Carrols Restaurant Group is led by our Chief Executive Officer and President, Daniel T. Accordino, who has over 45 years of Burger King and quick-service restaurant experience at our company. 
Operations for our Burger King restaurants are overseen by our new Chief Operating Officer, Carl Hauch, who joined us in February of 2021 and has over 20 years of experience in restaurant and retail operations, most recently in the Wendy's system, as well as two Division Vice Presidents and 13 Regional Directors that have an average of 22 years of Burger King restaurant experience. Our 148 district managers support the Regional Directors in the management of our Burger King restaurants. Operations for our Popeyes restaurants are overseen by two Regional Directors and nine district managers. 
A district manager is responsible for the direct oversight of the day-to-day operations of an average of approximately seven to eight restaurants. Typically, district managers have previously served as restaurant managers at one of our restaurants. Regional directors, district managers and restaurant managers are compensated with a fixed salary plus an incentive bonus based upon the performance of the restaurants under their supervision, and for our regional directors and district managers, the combined performance of all of our restaurants. Most often, our restaurants are staffed with hourly employees who are supervised by a salaried general manager and one to three assistant managers. 
Management Information Systems 
Our management information systems provide us with the ability to efficiently and effectively manage our restaurants and to ensure the consistent application of operating controls at our restaurants. Our size affords us the ability to maintain an in-house staff of information technology and restaurant systems professionals dedicated to continuously enhancing our systems. In addition, these capabilities allow us to quickly integrate restaurants that we acquire and achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies. 
We typically replace the POS systems at restaurants we acquire shortly after acquisition and implement our POS, labor and inventory management systems. Our restaurants employ touch-screen POS systems that are designed to facilitate accuracy and speed of order taking. These systems are user-friendly, require limited cashier training and improve speed-of-service through the use of conversational order-taking techniques. The POS systems are integrated with PC-based applications at the restaurant and hosted systems at our corporate office that are designed to facilitate financial and management control of our restaurant operations. 
Our restaurant systems provide daily tracking and reporting of traffic counts, menu item sales, labor and food data including costs and inventories, and other key operating metrics for each restaurant. We communicate electronically with our restaurants on a continuous basis via a high-speed data network, which enables us to collect this information for use in our corporate management systems in near real-time. Our corporate headquarters manages systems that support all of our accounting, operating and reporting systems. We also operate a 24-hour, seven-day help desk at our corporate headquarters that enables us to provide systems and operational support to our restaurant operations as required. Among other things, our restaurant information systems provide us with the ability to: 
•monitor labor utilization and sales trends on a real-time basis at each restaurant, enabling the restaurant manager to effectively manage to our established labor standards on a timely basis; 
•reduce inventory shrinkage using restaurant-level inventory management systems and daily reporting of inventory variances; 
•analyze sales and product mix data to help restaurant managers forecast production levels throughout the day; 
•monitor day-part drive-thru speed of service at each of our restaurants; 
•allow the restaurant manager to produce day-part labor schedules based on the restaurant's historical sales patterns;
•systematically communicate human resource and payroll data to our administrative offices for efficient centralized management of labor costs and payroll processing; 
•allow customers to place mobile and third-party delivery orders that integrate directly with the point-of-sale system;
•employ centralized control over pricing, menu and inventory management activities at the restaurant utilizing the remote management capabilities of our systems; 
•take advantage of electronic commerce including the ability to place orders with suppliers and to integrate detailed invoice, receiving and product data with our inventory and accounting systems; 
•provide analyses, reporting and tools to enable all levels of management to review a wide-range of financial, product mix and operational data; and
•systematically analyze and report on detailed transactional data to help detect and identify potential theft. 
Critical information from our systems is available in near real-time to our restaurant managers, who are expected to react quickly to trends or situations in their restaurants. Our district managers also receive near real-time information for their respective restaurants and have access to key operating data on a remote basis using our corporate intranet-based reporting. Management personnel at all levels, from the restaurant manager through senior management, utilize and monitor key restaurant performance indicators that are also included in our restaurant-level incentive bonus plans.

Each of our Burger King restaurants operates under a separate franchise agreement with BKC. Each of our Popeyes restaurants operates under a separate franchise agreement with PLK. Our franchise agreements with BKC and PLK generally require, among other things, that all restaurants comply with specified design criteria and operate in a prescribed manner, including utilization of a standard menu. In addition, our Burger King franchise agreements generally require that our restaurants conform to BKC's current image and may provide for updating our restaurants during the tenth year of the agreements to conform to such current image, which may require significant expenditures. 
These franchise agreements with BKC and PLK generally provide for an initial term of 20 years and currently have an initial franchise fee of $50,000. In the event that we terminate a franchise agreement and close the related BKC restaurant prior to the expiration of its term, we generally are required to pay BKC an amount based on the net present value of the royalty stream that would have been realized by BKC had such franchise agreement not been terminated. With BKC's and PLK's respective approval, we can elect to extend franchise agreements for additional 20 year terms, provided that the restaurant meets the current restaurant image standard and we are not in default under terms of the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement fee for subsequent renewals for our Burger King and Popeyes restaurants is currently $50,000. BKC or PLK may terminate any of the franchise agreements if an act of default is committed by us under these agreements and such default is not cured. Defaults under the franchise agreements for our Burger King and Popeyes restaurants include, among other things, our failure to operate such restaurant in accordance with the operating standards and specifications established by BKC or PLK (including failure to use equipment, uniforms or decor approved by the respective franchisor), our failure to sell products approved or designated by BKC or PLK, our failure to pay royalties or advertising and sales promotion contributions as required, our unauthorized sale, transfer or assignment of such franchise agreement or the related restaurant, certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, conduct by us or our employees that has a harmful effect on the Burger King or Popeyes restaurant system, conviction of us or our executive officers for certain indictable offenses, our failure to maintain a responsible credit rating or our acquisition of an interest in any other hamburger restaurant business. At January 3, 2021, we were not in default under any of our franchise agreements with BKC or PLK.
In order to obtain a successor franchise agreement with BKC and PLK, a franchisee is typically required to make capital improvements to the restaurant to bring it up to BKC's or PLK's current image standards. The cost of these improvements may vary widely depending upon the magnitude of the required changes and the degree to which we have made interim improvements to the restaurant. At January 3, 2021, we had 12 Burger King franchise agreements due to expire in 2021, 14 Burger King franchise agreements due to expire in 2022 and 3 Burger King franchise agreements due to expire in 2023, as well as 32 that expired prior to the end of 2020. At January 3, 2021 we had two Popeyes franchise agreements set to expire in 2021, four Popeyes franchise agreements set to expire in 2022 and one Popeyes franchise agreement set to expire in 2023, as well as six Popeyes franchise agreements that expired prior to the end of 2020. 
We believe that we will be able to satisfy BKC's and PLK's normal franchise agreement renewal criteria. Accordingly, we believe that renewal franchise agreements will be granted on a timely basis by BKC and PLK at 
the expiration of our existing franchise agreements. Historically, BKC has granted all of our requests for successor franchise agreements. However, there can be no assurance that BKC and PLK will grant these requests in the future. 
In recent years, the historical costs of improving our Burger King restaurants in connection with franchise renewals generally have ranged from $400,000 to $800,000 per restaurant. The average cost of our remodels in 2020 was approximately $1.1 million per restaurant. The cost of remodels can vary depending upon the age and condition of the restaurant and the amount of new equipment needed. The cost of capital improvements made in connection with future franchise agreement renewals may differ substantially from past franchise renewals depending on the current image requirements established from time to time by BKC or PLK. 
We evaluate the performance of our Burger King and Popeyes restaurants on an ongoing basis. With respect to franchise renewals, such evaluation depends on many factors, including our assessment of the anticipated future operating results of the subject restaurants and the cost of required capital improvements that we would need to commit for such restaurants. If we determine that a Burger King or Popeyes restaurant is under-performing, or that we do not anticipate an adequate return on the capital investment required to renew the franchise agreement, we may elect to close such restaurant. We may also relocate (offset) a restaurant within its trade area and build a new Burger King or Popeyes restaurant as part of the franchise renewal process. In 2020, we closed 34 Burger King restaurants, including one offset location. We currently expect to close less than five Burger King restaurants in 2021, excluding any relocations of existing restaurants. Our determination to close these restaurants is subject to further evaluation and may change. We may also elect to close additional restaurants in the future. 
In addition to the initial franchise fee, we generally pay BKC and PLK a monthly royalty. The royalty rate for new Burger King restaurants and for successor franchise agreements is 4.5% of sales. The royalty rate for new Popeyes restaurants and for successor franchise agreements is 5.0% of sales. Royalty payments for restaurants acquired from other franchisees are based on the terms of existing franchise agreements being acquired, and may be less than 4.5%. Burger King royalties, as a percentage of restaurant sales, were 4.3% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We anticipate our Burger King and Popeyes royalties, as a percentage of restaurant sales, will be approximately 4.4% in 2021 as a result of the terms outlined above. Newly constructed Burger King restaurants developed pursuant to the ADA as well as the Amended ADA received and will receive a 1% royalty rate reduction for a four year period and certain remodeled restaurants under the ADA generally received and will receive a 0.75% royalty rate reduction for a five year period.
We also generally contribute 4% of restaurant sales from our Burger King and Popeyes restaurants to fund BKC's and PLK's national and regional advertising. Pursuant to the ADA and Amended ADA, newly constructed Burger King restaurants will receive a 3% advertising contribution reduction for four years and certain remodeled restaurants, excluding upgrades, will receive a 0.75% advertising contribution reduction for a five year period. BKC and PLK engage in substantial national and regional advertising and promotional activities and other efforts to maintain and enhance both brands. From time to time we supplement BKC's marketing with our own local advertising and promotional campaigns. See “Advertising, Products and Promotion” below. 
Our franchise agreements with BKC and PLK do not give us exclusive rights to operate Burger King restaurants in any defined territory. Although we believe that BKC generally seeks to ensure that newly granted franchises do not materially adversely affect the operations of existing Burger King restaurants, we cannot assure you that franchises granted by BKC to third parties will not adversely affect any Burger King restaurants that we operate. 
Advertising, Products and Promotion 
BKC's marketing strategy is characterized by its HAVE IT YOUR WAY® service, TASTE IS KING® tag line, flame grilling, generous portions and competitive prices. Burger King restaurants feature flame-grilled hamburgers, the most popular of which is the Whopper® sandwich, a large, flame-grilled hamburger garnished with mayonnaise, lettuce, onions, pickles and tomatoes. The basic menu of all Burger King restaurants also includes a variety of hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, onion rings, soft drinks, salads, breakfast items, snacks and other offerings. BKC and its franchisees have historically spent between 4% and 5% of their respective sales on marketing, advertising and promotion to sustain high brand awareness. BKC's marketing initiatives are designed to reach a diverse consumer base and BKC has continued to introduce a number of new and enhanced products to broaden menu offerings and drive customer traffic in all day parts.
BKC's and PLK's advertising programs consist of national campaigns supplemented by local advertising. BKC's and PLK's advertising campaigns are generally carried on television, radio and in circulated print media (national and regional newspapers and magazines). As a percentage of our restaurant sales advertising expense was 3.9% in 2020, 4.0% in 2019 and 4.1% in 2018. For 2021, we expect total advertising expense to be approximately 4.0% of total restaurant sales.
The efficiency and quality of advertising and promotional programs can significantly affect the quick-service restaurant businesses. We believe that one of the major advantages of being a Burger King franchisee is the value of the extensive national and regional advertising and promotional programs conducted by BKC. In addition to the benefits derived from BKC's advertising spending, we sometimes supplement BKC's advertising and promotional activities with our own local advertising and promotions, including the purchase of additional television, radio and print advertising. The concentration of our Burger King restaurants in many of our markets permits us to leverage advertising in those markets. We also utilize promotional programs targeted to our customers, such as combination value meals and discounted prices in order to create a flexible and directed marketing program. 
Digital
BKC and PLK have invested heavily in launching a digital platform that integrates with major third-party delivery service providers and provides a seamless ordering, payment, delivery and drive thru experience for our guests. In the BKC and PLK platforms, guests can place orders through a website or mobile app and have the product ready for pickup or delivered by a third-party partner. Digital sales, including sales through the delivery platforms plus mobile order and pay, have been a strong growth driver and represented approximately 4.4% of our restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 3.1% of our sales for all of 2020. We are also installing outdoor digital menu boards in all drive thru locations. In 2020, we installed outdoor digital menu boards at 359 Burger King restaurants and expect to complete the remaining installation of outdoor digital menu boards at all of our Burger King and Popeyes restaurants by the first half of 2022. The menu boards integrate with the POS system and allow for artificial intelligence to help optimize the guest experience. BKC and PLK continue to invest in the digital platform and BKC intends to launch its Royal Perks loyalty program in 2021, which will be driven from its mobile app.
Suppliers
We are a member of a national purchasing cooperative, Restaurant Services, Inc., which we refer to as "RSI", created for the Burger King system. RSI is a non-profit independent purchasing cooperative that is responsible for sourcing our products and related supplies and managing relationships with approved distributors for the Burger King system. We use our purchasing power to negotiate directly with certain other vendors, to help obtain favorable pricing and terms for supplying our restaurants. For our Burger King restaurants, we are required to purchase all of our foodstuffs, paper goods and packaging materials from BKC-approved suppliers at prices negotiated by RSI. We currently primarily utilize four distributors, Lineage Foodservice Solutions, LLC, Reinhart Food Service L.L.C, McLane Company Inc., and Performance Foodservice, to supply our Burger King restaurants with the majority of our foodstuffs. As of January 3, 2021, such distributors supplied 34%, 28%, 28% and 10%, respectively, of our Burger King restaurants. 
For our Popeyes restaurants we are a member of a national purchasing cooperative, Supply Management Services, Inc. ("SMS"). SMS is a non-profit independent purchasing cooperative that is responsible for sourcing certain of our products and managing relationships with approved distributors for the Popeyes system. Popeyes utilizes five distributors, two for poultry products and three for all other products. For our Popeyes restaurants, one distributor, Tyson Foods, supplies 75% of our poultry products. Another distributor, Customized Distribution Services, Inc. supplies 60 of our Popeyes restaurants with all non- poultry products.
We may purchase non-food items, such as kitchen utensils, equipment maintenance tools and other supplies, from any suitable source so long as such items meet BKC and PLK product uniformity standards. All BKC-approved and PLK-approved distributors are required to purchase foodstuffs and supplies from BKC-approved and PLK-approved manufacturers and purveyors. BKC and PLK are each responsible for monitoring quality control and supervision of the applicable manufacturers. Each conducts regular visits to observe the preparation of foodstuffs and to perform various tests to ensure that only quality foodstuffs are sold to its approved suppliers. In addition, BKC and PLK coordinate and supervise audits of approved suppliers and distributors to determine continuing 
product specification compliance and to ensure that manufacturing plant and distribution center standards are met. Although we believe that we have alternative sources of supply available to our restaurants, the failure of a distributor or supplier for our restaurants to service us, could lead to a disruption of service or supply at our restaurants until a new distributor or supplier is engaged, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
Quality Assurance 
Our operational focus is closely monitored to achieve a high level of customer satisfaction based on product quality, speed of service, order accuracy and quality of service. Our senior management and restaurant management staffs are principally responsible for ensuring compliance with BKC's and PLK's required operating procedures. We have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the quality, preparation and selection of menu items, maintenance and cleanliness of the premises and employee conduct. In order to maintain compliance with these operating standards and specifications, we distribute detailed reports measuring compliance with various customer service standards and objectives to our restaurant operations management team, including feedback obtained directly from our customers through instructions given to them at the point of sale. The customer feedback is monitored by an independent agency and us and consists of evaluations of speed of service, quality of service, quality of our menu items and other operational objectives including the cleanliness of our restaurants. We also have our own staff that handle customer inquiries and complaints. The level of customer satisfaction is a key metric in our restaurant-level incentive bonus plans. 
We operate in accordance with quality assurance and health standards mandated by federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These standards include food preparation rules regarding, among other things, minimum cooking times and temperatures, maximum time standards for holding prepared food, food handling guidelines and cleanliness. To maintain these standards, under BKC's oversight third-party firms conduct unscheduled inspections and follow-up inspections of our restaurants and report their findings to us. In addition, restaurant managers conduct internal inspections for taste, quality, cleanliness and food safety on a regular basis. 
Trademarks 
As a franchisee of Burger King and Popeyes, we also have contractual rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property relating to the Burger King and Popeyes concepts. We have no proprietary intellectual property other than the Carrols logo and trademark. 
Government Regulation 
Various federal, state and local laws affect our business, including various health, sanitation, fire and safety standards. Restaurants to be constructed or remodeled are subject to state and local building code and zoning requirements. In connection with the development and remodeling of our restaurants, we may incur costs to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
We are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as the handling, preparation and sale of food and beverages; the provision of nutritional information on menu boards; minimum wage requirements; unemployment compensation; overtime; and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. 
A significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the federal, and where applicable, state minimum wage. Accordingly, increases in the minimum wage have increased and in the future will increase wage rates at our restaurants. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Act”) required businesses employing fifty or more full-time equivalent employees to offer health care benefits to those full-time employees or be subject to an annual penalty. Those benefits must be provided under a health care plan which provides a certain minimum scope of health care services. The Act also limits the portion of the cost of the benefits which we can require employees to pay. Based on our enrollment history to date, approximately 14% of our approximately 3,500 eligible hourly employees have opted for coverage under our medical plan.
We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. We believe that we conduct our operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations. 
Our costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition in the past.
Industry and Competition 
The Restaurant Market. Restaurant sales historically have closely tracked several macroeconomic indicators and we believe that “away-from-home” food consumption will increase due to these trends in recent years. Historically, unemployment has been inversely related to restaurant sales and, as the unemployment rate decreases and disposable income increases, restaurant sales have increased. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, through November 2020 food away from home dollars were 44.8% of nominal food dollars, with total expenditures decreasing 18.3% from the same period in 2019. This reflects changes in the overall restaurant industry as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but not the quick-service segment. Our sales stabilized in May 2020 as guests have relied on our take-out and delivery service modes.
Quick-Service Restaurants. We operate in the hamburger and chicken categories of the quick-service restaurant segments of the restaurant industry. Quick-service restaurants are distinguished by high speed of service and efficiency, convenience, limited menu and service, and value pricing. According to Nation's Restaurant News, 2019 U.S. foodservice sales for the Top 200 restaurant chains increased 3.8% from 2018 to $313.5 billion. Of this amount, the hamburger category represented $88.8 billion, or 28.3%, making it the largest category of the quick-service segment.
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants, offering low and medium-priced fare. We also compete with operators outside the restaurant industry such as convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in supermarkets, grocery stores, cafeterias and other purveyors offering moderately priced and quickly prepared foods. Our competitors may also employ marketing strategies such as frequent use of price discounting, frequent promotions and an emphasis on value menus. 
We believe that product quality and taste, brand recognition, convenience of location, speed of service, menu variety, price, and ambiance are the most important competitive factors in the quick-service restaurant segment and that our restaurants effectively compete in each category. We believe our largest competitors for our Burger King restaurants are McDonald's and Wendy's and the largest competitors for our Popeyes restaurants are KFC and Chik-fil-A. 
Human Capital Management 
As of January 3, 2021, we employed approximately 26,500 persons, of which approximately 200 were administrative personnel and approximately 26,300 were restaurant operations personnel. Approximately 75% of our employees are part-time and 80% have been employed by the Company for less than one year. None of our employees are unionized or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our overall relations with our employees are good and that our efforts to manage our workforce have been effective. 
Diversity
We are committed to fostering a culture that encourages diversity and inclusion, and having diverse representation in our workforce. As of January 3, 2021, 56% of our employee base was female and approximately 56% of our employee base was comprised of racial and ethnic minorities. 
Training
We maintain a comprehensive training and development program for all of our personnel and provide both classroom and in-restaurant training for our salaried and hourly restaurant personnel. Our program emphasizes, among other things, system-wide operating procedures, food preparation methods, food safety and customer service 
standards. BKC's and PLK's training and development programs are also available to us as a franchisee through web access in all of our restaurants. 
COVID-19 Response
Throughout the course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have been adapting our business in order to continue operating safely, including, among other things, by doing the following: 
•To support the health and safety of our employees, beginning in March 2020 we have mandated, among other things, the use of masks, sanitizers and contactless procedures in our restaurants, and have required team members' temperatures be taken at the beginning of each shift. 
•We have increased the use of low contact procedures for food delivery, including installation of plexiglass barriers at the front counter and drive thru and the implementation of delivery services. 
•We have suspended all non-essential travel for our employees and implemented a work-from-home policy for all non-restaurant personnel. 
•We have established a "Carrols Cares" fund to provide immediate relief to employees in need.
