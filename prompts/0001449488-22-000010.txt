About CSI Compressco LP
We are a provider of contract services including natural gas compression services and treating services. Natural gas compression is used for oil and natural gas production, gathering, artificial lift, transmission, processing, and storage. Treating services include removal of contaminants from a natural gas stream and cooling to reduce the temperature of produced gas and liquids. We also sell used standard compressor packages and provide aftermarket services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. We provide contract compression and treating services and compressor parts and component sales to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States, as well as in a number of international locations, including the countries of Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Egypt and Chile. Previously, our equipment sales (new unit sales) business included the fabrication and sale of new standard and custom-designed, engineered compressor packages fabricated primarily at our facility in Midland, Texas. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we fully exited the new unit sales business.
We are one of the largest service providers of natural gas compression services in the United States, using our fleet of compressor packages that employ a full spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. Low-horsepower compressor packages enhance production for dry gas wells and liquids-loaded gas wells by deliquefying the wells, lowering wellhead pressure, and increasing gas velocity. These packages are also used in connection with oil and liquids production and in vapor recovery and casing gas system applications. Low- to medium-horsepower compressor packages are typically selected for wellhead and natural gas gathering systems, artificial lift systems, and other applications primarily in connection with natural gas and oil production. Our high-horsepower compressor package offerings are typically deployed in natural gas production, natural gas gathering, centralized gas lift, centralized compression facilities, and midstream applications.
Our aftermarket business provides a wide range of services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers to support the needs of customers who own compression equipment. These services include operations, maintenance, overhaul, and reconfiguration services and may be provided under turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contracts. Our aftermarket services are provided by our factory- and internally-trained technicians in most of the major oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States and Mexico.
Our long-term growth strategy includes expanding our existing businesses through organic growth and accretive acquisitions, both in the U.S. and internationally.
Our operations are organized into a single business segment. See Note 16 - “Segments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further information. For financial information regarding our revenues and total assets, see Note 17 - “Geographic Information” contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.
 Contribution of Spartan entities
On November 10, 2021, the Partnership entered into a Contribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) by and among the Partnership, CSI Compressco GP, Spartan, and CSI Compressco Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Compressco Sub”). Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Spartan contributed to the Partnership 100% of the limited liability company interest in Treating Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Treating Holdco”), 100% of the common stock in Spartan Terminals Operating, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Spartan Terminals”), and 99% of the limited liability company interests in Spartan Operating Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Spartan Operating” and together with Treating Holdco and Spartan Terminals, “Spartan Treating”) (such interests in Spartan Treating, the “Contributed Interests”) and the Partnership, CSI Compressco GP and Spartan agreed to cancel the incentive distribution rights (the “IDRs”) in the Partnership in exchange for the issuance of 48.4 million common units. We refer to the acquisition of the Contributed Interests as the “Spartan Acquisition.” As the Partnership and Spartan Treating were under common control at the time of the Spartan Acquisition, the results of operations have been combined for the Partnership and Spartan Treating from the date of common control which was January 29, 2021.
Certain of our U.S. services are performed by our wholly owned subsidiary CSI Compressco Operating LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Operating LLC”), pursuant to contracts that our outside legal counsel has concluded generate qualifying income under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or “qualifying income.” We do not pay U.S. federal income taxes on the portion of our business conducted by Operating LLC. Compressco Sub, which is also a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, conducts substantially all of our operations that our outside legal counsel has not concluded generate qualifying income, and we pay U.S. federal income tax with respect to such operations. We strive to ensure that all new U.S. compression contracts are entered into by our Operating LLC and generate qualifying income. We also pay state and local income taxes in certain states, and we incur income taxes related to our foreign operations.
As a limited partnership, we are managed and controlled by our general partner. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our general partner was a wholly owned subsidiary of TETRA. On January 29, 2021, Spartan acquired from TETRA our general partner, our IDRs and 10.95 million of our common units in the Partnership (the “GP Sale”). As of March 10, 2022, common units held by the public represented approximately a 50.9% ownership interest, which is exclusive of Spartan’s 45.0% limited partner interest and 0.5% general partner interest, and TETRA’s 3.7% limited partner interest. In connection with the GP Sale, on January 29, 2021, TETRA entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the “Transition Services Agreement”) with the Partnership, pursuant to which TETRA provided certain accounting, information technology and back office support services to the Partnership for a period of one year following closing. The Transition Services Agreement with TETRA expired on January 31, 2022.
    Through Spartan’s wholly owned subsidiary and our general partner, CSI Compressco GP LLC, Spartan manages and controls us. We rely on our general partner’s board of directors and executive officers to manage our operations and make decisions on our behalf. Our general partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Spartan. Unlike shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, our unitholders are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors. Following the GP Sale, all of our general partner’s directors are elected by Spartan. Our general partner does not receive any management fee in connection with its management of our business. However, our general partner is reimbursed for certain expenses, including compensation expenses, incurred on our behalf. In addition, our general partner receives distributions based on its limited and general partner interests. 
Products and Services
    We are a provider of contract services including natural gas compression services and treating services. Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a higher pressure. It is essential to the production and movement of natural gas. Compression is typically required numerous times in the natural gas production and sales cycle, including (i) at the wellheads, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities, and (iv) in natural gas pipelines. Compression is also utilized for gas lift, an artificial lift technique for producing oil that has insufficient reservoir pressure. Natural gas treating encompasses several processes used to remove contaminants and improve the marketability of gas. We also provide aftermarket compression services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers.
Contract Services
    We use our fleet of compressor packages to provide a variety of compression services to our customers to meet their specific requirements. Our fleet includes approximately 4,800 compressor packages that provide approximately 1.2 million in aggregate horsepower, employing a wide spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. The horsepower of our natural gas compressor package fleet as of December 31, 2021 is summarized in the following table:

Range of Horsepower Per Package | Number of Packages | Aggregate Horsepower | | % of Aggregate Horsepower
Low-horsepower (0-100) | 2,936 | | 138,982 | | 12 | %
Medium-horsepower (101-1,000) | 1,438 | | 409,290 | | 34 | %
High-horsepower (1,001 and over) | 459 | | 648,570 | | 54 | %
Total | 4,833 | | 1,196,842 | | 100 | %

    Low-Horsepower (0-100 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our natural gas-powered, low-horsepower compressor packages include our GasJack® compressor packages that are relatively compact and easy to transport to our customer’s well site. We utilize our electric powered, low-horsepower VJack™ compressor packages to provide production enhancement services on wells where electric power is available. Our low-horsepower packages allow us to perform wellhead compression, fluids separation, and optional gas metering services all from one skid, thereby providing services that otherwise would generally require the use of multiple, more costly pieces of equipment. We utilize our low-horsepower compressor packages to provide production enhancement for dry gas wells and liquid-loaded gas wells and backside auto injection systems (“BAIS”). BAIS monitors tubing pressure to redirect gas flow into the casing annulus as needed to help gas wells unload liquids that hinder production. We also utilize our low-horsepower compressor packages to collect hydrocarbon vapors that are a by-product of oil production and storage (“vapor recovery”) and to reduce casing pressure of pumping oil wells to enhance oil production (“casing gas systems”).

    Medium-horsepower (101-1,000 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our medium-horsepower compressor packages are primarily utilized to move natural gas from the wellhead through the field gathering system by boosting the pressure of the natural gas flowing through the system. Additionally, these compressor packages are used to reinject natural gas into producing vertical and horizontal oil wells that have insufficient reservoir pressure, to help lift liquids to the surface (“gas lift operations”). Typically, these applications require medium-horsepower compressor packages located at or near the wellhead. These compressor packages are also used to increase the efficiency of low-capacity natural gas fields by providing a central compression point from which the natural gas can be further processed and transported. These compressor packages feature primarily two- and three-stage compressors powered by natural gas engines ranging from 101 to 1,000 horsepower and equipped with interstage cooling.
    High-Horsepower (Over 1,000 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our high-horsepower compressor packages are primarily utilized in midstream applications including natural gas gathering, gas lift, and centralized compression facilities. They boost the pressure of natural gas flowing from individual wells or a group of wells into a gathering pipeline that leads to various types of processing facilities. A significant number of these compressor packages in midstream applications also serve the dual purpose of gas lift operations by injecting a percentage of the compressed natural gas into producing oil wells. Our high-horsepower compressor packages are also used in connection with the transmission of natural gas from gathering systems to storage facilities or end users. These compressor packages feature primarily two- and three-stage compressors powered by natural gas engines.
Gas Treating. We provide a variety of natural gas treating services for natural gas producers and midstream companies, such as providing equipment for lease or sale, equipment installation services and the operation of equipment which Spartan Treating refers to as contract services. Spartan Treating’s two primary gas treating services provided for customers are the removal of contaminants from the customer’s gas stream and natural gas cooling to reduce the gas temperature. Spartan Treating maintains a fleet of amine plants ranging in size used to treat varying customer gas flow volumes by removing hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide to meet required pipeline specifications. Additionally, Spartan Treating’s equipment fleet includes natural gas cooling units used to reduce the temperature of natural gas so that it can be further treated, processed or compressed.
    Other Related Services.    In Mexico, we provide well monitoring and sand separation services in connection with our compression services. Well monitoring services include a variety of services that monitor and optimize production from oil and gas wells. We utilize automated sand separators, which are high-pressure vessels with automated valve operation functions, at the well to remove solids that would otherwise cause abrasive wear damage to compression and other equipment that is installed downstream and inhibit production from the well.
    Contract Services Contract Terms. Our contract services are primarily performed under service contracts using our low-, medium-, and high-horsepower compressor packages and our treating assets. A significant portion of these compression services are provided under services contracts that our outside legal counsel has concluded generate qualifying income. Under these services contracts, we are responsible for providing our services in accordance with the particular specifications of a job. As owner and operator, we are responsible for operating and maintaining the equipment we utilize to provide our services. Our low horsepower compression service contracts typically have an initial term of one month and, unless terminated by us or our customers with 30-days’ notice, continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter. Our medium- and high- horsepower compression service and treating contracts typically have an initial term of twelve months, but range from six months to thirty-six months. After the initial terms on our medium- and high-horsepower compression service and treating contracts, customers typically continue on a month-to-month basis or renew for additional extensions. We charge our customers a fixed monthly fee for the services provided under the services contracts. Aside from factors beyond our control, if the level of services we provide falls below certain contractually specified percentages, our customers are generally entitled to request limited credits against our service fees. To date, these credits have been insignificant as a percentage of revenue. 

    We generally own the equipment we use to provide services to our customers, and we bear the risk of loss to this equipment to the extent not caused by (i) a breach of certain obligations of the customer, primarily involving the service site and the fuel gas being supplied to us, or (ii) an uncontrolled well condition. Utilizing our proprietary, telemetry-based reporting system, we remotely monitor, in real time, whether our services are being continuously provided at our U.S. customer well sites.
    As owner of the equipment, we are obligated to pay ad valorem taxes levied on the equipment and related insurance expenses, and we do not seek reimbursement for such taxes and expenses from our service agreement customers.
Aftermarket Services
    Through our aftermarket operations, we provide a wide range of services to support the needs of customers who own compression equipment. The services provided are primarily operation, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services, which may be provided under turnkey contracts. We also sell engine parts, compressor package parts and other parts manufactured by third parties that are utilized in natural gas compressor packages. We have factory- and internally-trained technicians in most of the major oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States to perform these services.
Market Overview and Competition

    Our operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for, and production of, oil and the associated natural gas from unconventional oil production along with natural gas production in the U.S. and international markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with oil supply disruptions from certain oil-producing nations, drove a significant drop in oil demand and oil prices in 2020, resulting in unprecedented production curtailments, negatively impacting demand for compression and related services. Amidst the challenging and uncertain market conditions, our customers drastically reduced capital budgets and took actions to reduce operating expenses. During the second quarter of 2020, customers released compression that was in excess of previously anticipated needs and on wells deemed uneconomic to produce at the lower commodity price levels. Commodity prices stabilized in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and gained strength throughout 2021. This improvement in commodity prices, as well as the beginning of a recovery in the general economy and the energy sector, have resulted in an increase in activity levels from our contract services and aftermarket services customers. Revenue from contract services has increased each quarter in 2021. In addition, we secured orders from key customers for new high-horsepower compressors that started generating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 and will continue to be deployed in the first half of 2022. Our customers continue to be focused on capital discipline; however, we continue to see improvement in the levels of quote activity and awards. As the market environment continues to evolve, competition for field employees has increased and inflationary pressures have driven certain costs higher. In 
addition, supply chain disruptions have impacted the availability of parts and supplies. We will continue to monitor these risks and take the necessary actions to mitigate them.
Customers

    We provide services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. We also have operations in Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Egypt and Chile. While most of our services in the U.S. are performed throughout Texas (with a concentration in the Permian Basin), the Haynesville shale, the San Juan Basin, the Rocky Mountain region, and the Mid-Continent region, we also have a presence in the Marcellus / Utica and other producing regions. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further expand our operations into other regions in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
 Following the expiration of the primary term, our service contracts generally continue month to month until terminated upon thirty days’ notice. Our low-horsepower compression fleet is generally deployed on short-term contracts while our medium- and high-horsepower fleet is generally deployed with an initial term of 12 months or greater. Although we enter into short-term contracts, the average duration a typical unit stays deployed with the same customer is greater than 30 months. Our significant customers for the year ended December 31, 2021 include various major integrated oil companies, public and private independent exploration and production companies and midstream companies, one of which individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.
Competition

    The natural gas compression services business is highly competitive. We experience competition from companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities and technologies, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Primary competition for our low-horsepower compression services business comes from smaller local and regional companies that utilize packages consisting of a screw or reciprocating compressor with a separate engine driver. These local and regional competitors tend to compete on the basis of price and availability, as opposed to our focus of adding value to the customer. Competition for our medium- and high-horsepower compression services business comes primarily from large companies that may have greater financial resources than we do. Such competitors include Archrock Compression Services, Kodiak Gas Services, USA Compression Partners and Natural Gas Compression Systems, Inc. Competitors for natural gas treating contract services include USA Compression Partners and Kinder Morgan.

    Many of our competitors compete on the basis of price. We believe our pricing has proven to be competitive because of the significant increase in value that results from use of our services, our customer service, trained field personnel, and the quality of the compressor packages we use to provide our services.
Other Business Matters

    We use various marketing strategies to promote our services and compressor package products. Our account managers work to build close working relationships with our existing and potential future customers, educating them about our services and products by scheduling personal visits, hosting and attending workshops, tradeshows and conferences, and participating in industry organizations. We sponsor and make presentations at industry events that are targeted to production managers, compression specialists and other decision makers. Our marketing representatives also use these marketing opportunities to promote our value-added service initiatives, such as the use of our proprietary telemetry-based system, our wellsite optimization program and our fleet reliability center.
Human Capital Management 

We collaborate as a team to execute for each other, our customers, and our shareholders. On December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 817 people worldwide. Our U.S. employees and our employees in Canada and Egypt are not subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our employees in Argentina and Mexico are 
subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that the various employers of these employees have good relations with these employees and we have not experienced work stoppages in the past.
Diversity and Inclusion
The diversity of our global workforce stimulates creativity and innovation as we use our collective talents to develop unique solutions to address the world's energy challenges. We seek to attract, retain, develop, and reward a high-performing and diverse workforce. To that end, we sponsor training activities to share best practices concerning diversity and inclusion education.
Career Development
Our executive team evaluates executive development and succession planning to prepare us for future success. The succession planning process covers all senior management positions and certain other key positions. This review of executive talent determines readiness to take on additional leadership roles and identifies developmental opportunities needed to prepare our executives for greater responsibilities. Our short and long-term business strategy is considered when evaluating candidates and their skills.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation programs are designed to incentivize performance, maximize returns, and build unitholder value. We work with consultants to benchmark our compensation and benefits programs to help us offer competitive compensation packages to attract and retain high-performing talent. We also offer competitive benefits to attract and retain exceptional talent.
Safety
Recognizing that safety, service quality, and environmental protection are conditions of employment, all employees and contractors are responsible for their safety, the safety of those around them, the quality of their work, and protection of the environment. As part of our safety-focused culture, it is customary that each meeting starts with an employee-led safety moment. 
To ensure our work remains safe and of the highest quality, we have a comprehensive HSEQ Management System and program designed to improve the capacity of the organization by controlling worksite risks, developing proper work practices and procedures, and empowering employees with stop-work authority if they observe unsafe conditions, omissions, errors, or actions that could result in safety or environmental incidents, or product and service quality issues. If an incident takes place, we investigate all serious occurrences to root causes and implement corrective actions to ensure we expand our capacity to operate safely.
Driving is one of the highest exposure activities that we undertake in our day-to-day operations. We maintain a fleet of DOT and non-DOT vehicles and provide positive, real-time behavior feedback to our drivers via real-time monitors. Coupled with vehicle selection guidelines, and driver training, we have a comprehensive approach to reducing our driving exposure and incidents.
Proprietary Technology and Trademarks

    It is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and third parties to whom we disclose our confidential and proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and expertise or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or expertise. Our management believes, however, that it would require a substantial period of time and substantial resources to independently develop similar know-how or technology.

    We sell various services and products under a variety of trademarks and service marks, some of which are registered in the United States.

Health, Safety, and Environmental Affairs Regulations
    Our service and sales operations are subject to stringent and complex U.S. and foreign health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, and, although we are committed to conducting all of our operations under the highest standards of safety and respect for the environment, risks of substantial costs and liabilities pursuant to laws 
and regulations are inherent in certain of our operations. Because of these risks, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred now or in the future. Changes in health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations could subject us to more rigorous standards and could affect demand for our customer’s product which in turn would impact demand for our products. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by any changes to existing laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, and policies, or any new laws, regulations, or policies promulgated in the future.
    We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of human health and the environment. The primary environmental laws that impact our operations in the U.S. include:
•the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations thereunder, which regulate air emissions;
•the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the “Clean Water Act”) and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including industrial wastewater discharges and storm water runoff;
•the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws and regulations thereunder, which regulate the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and
•the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which impose liability for the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances in the environment.
    Our operations in the U.S. are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers.
    The CAA and implementing regulations, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements, including requirements related to emissions from certain stationary engines, including our compressor packages. These laws and regulations impose limits on the levels of various substances that may be emitted into the atmosphere from our compressor packages and require us to meet stringent air emission standards and install new emission control equipment on all of our engines built after July 1, 2008. In addition, regulations under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) provisions of the CAA require control of hazardous air pollutants from new and existing stationary reciprocal internal combustion engines. Our equipment is also subject to prescribed maintenance practices and catalyst installation may also be required. Furthermore, in June 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) finalized rules that establish new air emission controls under the EPA’s New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and NESHAP for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities. These rules establish specific requirements associated with volatile organic compounds and methane emissions from compressor packages and controllers at natural gas gathering and boosting stations. While the EPA under the Trump Administration finalized rules to rescind or modify certain of these requirements in September 2020, including removing sources in the transmission and storage segment from the source category and rescinding the methane-specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments of the oil and gas industry, various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging the EPA’s June 2016 standards and its September 2020 final rule. However, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, a revocation of the 2020 rulemaking effectively reinstating the 2016 standards. Additionally, in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish OOOOb new source and OOOOc first-time existing source standards of performance for GHG and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions for crude oil and natural gas well sites, natural gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, natural gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. Owners or operators of affected emission units or processes would have to comply with specific standards of performance that may include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirements, reduction of emissions by 95% through capture and control systems, zero-emission requirements, operations and maintenance requirements, and so-called “green well” completion requirements. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal enhancing this proposed rulemaking in 2022 that will contain proposed rule text, which was not included in the November 2021 proposed rule, and anticipates issuing a final rule by the end of 2022. While we are not currently aware of any material impacts to our operations associated with the current regulatory requirements, additional or more stringent regulations could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements on our equipment that could require us to incur material costs.
    The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, they contribute to global warming and climate change. As a result, the EPA has begun to regulate certain sources of GHGs, including air emissions associated with oil and gas production particularly as they relate to the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas wells. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and gas processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. Reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. The EPA’s rules relating to emissions of GHGs from large stationary sources of emissions have been the subject of a number of legal challenges. While these rules were the subject of EPA’s recent deregulatory agenda under the Trump Administration, the EPA under the Biden Administration is expected to reconsider any relaxation of such rules, and potentially impose more stringent GHG emissions requirements from large stationary sources, as President Biden has issued executive orders that commit to substantial action on climate change and the reduction of GHG emissions, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and an increased emphasis on climate-related risk across government agencies and economic sectors. Further, Congress has considered, and almost one-half of the states have adopted, legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of GHGs from a wide range of sources.
    The Clean Water Act and implementing regulations, and comparable state laws and regulations, prohibit the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters without a permit and establish limits on the levels of pollutants contained in these discharges. In addition, the Clean Water Act and other comparable laws and regulations regulate storm water discharges associated with industrial activities depending on a facility’s primary standard industrial classification.

    RCRA and implementing regulations, and comparable state laws and regulations, address the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer, and disposal of wastes including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, filters, sludges, paint, solvents and sandblast materials. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes.

    CERCLA and comparable state laws and regulations impose strict, joint, and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of such hazardous substances released at a site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.

    Although we believe that we have properly disposed of all historical waste streams and that we have no outstanding liability regarding any past waste handling or spill activities, there is always the possibility that future spills and releases of petroleum hydrocarbons, wastes, or other regulated substances into the environment could cause us to become subject to remediation costs and liabilities under CERCLA, RCRA, or other environmental laws. The costs and liabilities associated with the future imposition of remedial obligations could have the potential for a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
    We are also subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. These laws and regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, and similar state statutes require that we maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
While we do not believe that compliance with existing requirements under applicable U.S. environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur substantial costs now or in the future with respect to compliance with or liability under such laws and regulations.
    Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to health, safety, and the environment and other regulated activities. While we do not believe that compliance with existing foreign environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur substantial costs now or in the future with respect to compliance with or liability under such foreign laws and regulations.
