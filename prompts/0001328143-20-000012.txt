ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
Overview
At Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc., our purpose is to make everyday life significantly better for people affected by neurological diseases. We are turning this purpose into reality by combining our proven expertise in discovery, development and commercialization with our passion for improving lives. We believe our medicines should be clinically differentiated and provide a meaningful benefit to patients. With one partnered product and a commercial medicine, we are focused on growing a portfolio of therapies to reduce the burden of neurological diseases on patients, caregivers, and society.
Our portfolio includes:
Approved Product:
•GOCOVRI® (amantadine) extended release capsules, is the first and only FDA-approved medication indicated for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications. It is also the only medicine clinically proven to reduce both dyskinesia and OFF in that population. GOCOVRI was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on August 24, 2017, with seven years of orphan exclusivity and additional patent protections out to 2034. On January 2, 2020, announced we had granted Sandoz Inc. a license for its generic version of GOCOVRI as of March 4, 2030, or earlier in certain circumstances typical for such agreements.
Potential Additional Indication for GOCOVRI (amantadine) Extended Release Capsules (ADS-5102):
•ADS-5102 in development for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis (“MSW”). We announced the topline results from INROADS Phase III trial of ADS-5102 on December 17, 2019. The study met its primary endpoint, showing a potential benefit for patients with walking impairment. We plan to complete additional analyses of the data from the INROADS trial to fully characterize the profile of ADS-5102 and evaluate the value and potential for the program in the first half of 2020.
Product Candidate:
•ADS-4101 (lacosamide) modified release capsules in development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. In 2019, we placed the development program on hold to focus on other priorities and are currently evaluating the potential value and options for a path forward for this candidate.
Partnered Product:
•Namzaric® (memantine hydrochloride extended release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of an Alzheimer’s type, marketed in the United States by Allergan plc under an exclusive license agreement between us and Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited (“Forest”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc (collectively, “Allergan”).
Products in our wholly-owned, non-partnered portfolio, potential additional indications for these products, and our product candidate, are protected by an array of intellectual property, including robust and diversified patent claims, and regulatory exclusivities.
We have developed our current portfolio of therapies in a capital efficient manner. As of December 31, 2019, we had raised a total of $335.6 million from equity financings, including $134.3 million in net proceeds raised in January 2018 from the sale of 3,450,000 shares of common stock and $61.8 million in net proceeds raised in January 2016 from the sale of 2,875,000 shares of common stock. We also received $160.0 million in upfront and milestone payments and $4.1 million in development funding from our partnership with Allergan plc. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $447.9 million and $132.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. In May 2017, we entered into a Royalty-Backed Loan with HealthCare Royalty Partners (“HCRP”). As of December 31, 2019, the total remaining payment obligation of the Royalty-Backed Loan was $190.9 million.
Our Strategy
Our business strategy is to discover, develop, and commercialize clinically differentiated medicines for patients suffering from chronic neurological diseases. We commercialize our products through our own specialty sales force, or through partnerships.

GOCOVRI® for the Treatment of Dyskinesia in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting close to one million people in the United States. It is caused by the gradual loss of brain cells that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. As the disease progresses, people are likely to experience unpredictable stiffness, rigidity and tremors, referred to as OFF time. The primary treatment for PD is with levodopa however, over time, levodopa may lead to involuntary, uncontrolled movements known as dyskinesia. The abrupt and unpredictable transitions between episodes of dyskinesia, normal movement, and OFF time lead to considerable impact on patient’s lives. 
Approximately 90 percent of people on levodopa therapy will eventually experience dyskinesia and OFF. Of the 700,000 Parkinson’s disease patients in the United States being treated with levodopa, we estimate around 200,000 currently experience OFF and dyskinesia.
GOCOVRI® (amantadine) extended-release capsules, approved by the FDA on August 24, 2017, is the first and only FDA-approved medicine indicated for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications. It is also the only medicine clinically proven to reduce both dyskinesia and OFF. GOCOVRI, taken once daily at bedtime, provides an initial lag and a slow rise in amantadine concentration during the night, resulting in a high concentration from the morning and throughout the waking day. Additionally, in the clinical trials, the adjunctive use of GOCOVRI did not require changes to dopaminergic therapies.
Upon approval, GOCOVRI was granted seven years of orphan exclusivity. We commenced the full commercial launch of GOCOVRI in January 2018 using our specialist neurology sales force. In addition to orphan exclusivity that protects GOCOVRI into 2024, issued patents provide GOCOVRI additional protections through 2034. On January 2, 2020, we announced we had granted Sandoz Inc. a license for its generic version of GOCOVRI as of March 4, 2030, which is over 12 years post GOCOVRI launch, or earlier in certain circumstances typical for such agreements. The agreement contains provisions that may accelerate the license date, including if unit sales of GOCOVRI for the 12-month period ending July 31, 2025 or any subsequent 12-month period decline by a specified percentage below GOCOVRI unit sales for the year ending December 31, 2019.
In a robust clinical program consisting of three randomized, placebo-controlled studies and a two-year open label safety study, GOCOVRI demonstrated a durable reduction in dyskinesia and OFF time in people with Parkinson’s disease. Specifically, the pooled data analysis from the two positive Phase 3 pivotal trials of GOCOVRI demonstrates:
•A 41% reduction in dyskinesia as measured on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale total score, compared to 14% for placebo at week 12;
•A reduction in OFF time of approximately one hour per day (placebo adjusted), or approximately 36%; and
•An increase of approximately 4.0 hours in functional ‘good ON’ time daily (ON time without troublesome dyskinesia), or approximately 45%.
The most common adverse reactions with GOCOVRI were hallucinations, dizziness, dry mouth, peripheral edema, constipation, falls and orthostatic hypotension. Warnings and precautions with GOCOVRI include falling asleep during activities of daily living, suicidality and depression, orthostatic hypertension/dizziness, and hallucinations/ psychotic behavior. 
In addition, the open label safety study of GOCOVRI, EASE LID 2, demonstrated a sustained improvement in levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) among patients using GOCOVRI. Results showed the treatment effect of GOCOVRI 
on motor complications (dyskinesia and OFF) was maintained for at least two years, providing long-term durability and safety data for GOCOVRI. This effect was seen in all patients in the study, including those who were switched from amantadine immediate release treatment to GOCOVRI and patients who had received deep brain stimulation treatment. Data from the open label study were accepted for publication in the Journal of Parkinson’s Disease and published online in January 2020.
To drive awareness and adoption of GOCOVRI by movement disorder centers, specialists and other neurologists for their Parkinson’s disease patients with dyskinesia and OFF, we deploy a field sales team of approximately 60 experienced neurology account specialists. This team is equipped with compelling educational materials demonstrating the benefit and safety profile of GOCOVRI for appropriate patients. Also, to facilitate patient access to, and physician experience of GOCOVRI, we have a free trial program. This program provides four weeks free trial of GOCOVRI in partnership with an exclusive specialty pharmacy to dispense all GOCOVRI prescriptions.
We support a number of financial support programs for eligible patients including: a co-pay assistance program for commercially insured patients, which requires no more than a $20 copay per prescription; a patient assistance program for under-insured or non-insured patients; and the provision of information for government insured patients about available programs to assist with their out of pocket costs.
Investigational Programs
ADS-5102 in Development for the Treatment of Walking Impairment in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune-mediated disorder that affects approximately 1 million people in the United States. Among the MS patients in the US, nearly 270,000 have walking impairment, which is present throughout the day. Walking impairment is a central feature of MS progression and impacts both quality of life and independence. Walking impairment in MS remains an area of high unmet need, as there is only one approved product on the market for this indication to which around one third of treated patients respond.
We are evaluating ADS-5102 (amantadine) extended release capsules, an investigational agent, taken once-daily at bedtime, in multiple sclerosis patients with walking impairment. Results from the Phase 3 INROADS study showed that subjects taking 274 mg ADS-5102 had a statistically significant improvement demonstrated by response rate of 21.1% compared to 11.3% taking placebo (p=0.01). Additionally, the response rate for subjects taking 137 mg ADS-5102 was 17.6% (p=0.08). The most common adverse events were: peripheral edema, dry mouth, fall, constipation, UTI, and insomnia. The reported adverse events associated with ADS-5102 in this study were dose-dependent and consistent with the known safety profile of amantadine. The open-label extension study of ADS-5102 in this population is ongoing.
Given these data, we will not initiate a second Phase III replicate study. We are continuing the open-label extension study and plan to complete additional analyses of the data from the INROADS trial to fully characterize the profile of ADS-5102 and evaluate the value and potential for the program. As part of this evaluation we expect to engage with the FDA in the first half of 2020.
ADS-4101 in Development for the Treatment of Partial Onset Seizures in Patients with Epilepsy
ADS-4101 is an investigational high-dose, modified release lacosamide capsule, taken once-daily at bedtime. Lacosamide is an anti-epilepsy active ingredient previously approved by the FDA and currently marketed by UCB SA/NV as VIMPAT® (lacosamide). Based upon the patents and regulatory exclusivities listed in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book, it is estimated that VIMPAT will lose patent exclusivity in March 2022. ADS-4101 was designed to reduce the initial rate-of-rise in lacosamide concentrations, potentially improving the adverse event profile and dose limitations due to dizziness following administration of VIMPAT.
Epilepsy affects an estimated three million Americans, of which approximately 60% have partial onset seizures. Of those people with partial onset seizures, about 30% to 40% of patients have poor seizure control with current anti-epilepsy drugs. There are limited data on the temporal distribution of seizures over the 24-hour day; however, published studies suggest that seizures occur in a diurnal pattern, characterized by a peak between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. and lowest between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. Thus, by matching the timing pattern of seizures to the concentration of the anti-epileptic 
drug, with a higher drug concentration during the day and lower drug concentration during the night, ADS-4101 may enable improved seizure control for adults with epilepsy in the United States.
We have completed two Phase 1 studies of ADS-4101 in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1a study showed that a single 400 mg dose of ADS-4101 was better tolerated compared to the equivalent dose of VIMPAT immediate release tablets. The data also demonstrated that ADS-4101 exhibited the desired pharmacokinetic properties, namely a reduced rate of initial rise and delayed time to maximum drug concentration appropriate for bedtime dosing. In addition, a multi-dose Phase 1b study demonstrated that a 600 mg dose of ADS-4101, taken once-nightly, provided a 1.5 to 2.5-fold increase in average lacosamide concentrations throughout the day compared to the maximum approved daily dose of 400 mg, taken as 200 mg twice-daily (BID), of VIMPAT immediate release tablets in healthy volunteers, with comparable tolerability.
We had an initial meeting with the FDA in 2018 regarding our planned Phase 3 pivotal programs for ADS-4101. In 2019, we placed this development program on hold in order to focus our resources on our priorities of GOCOVRI commercialization, and our MSW development program. We continue to fully evaluate the potential value of ADS-4101 and options for its further development both internally and through partnering opportunities.
Namzaric® (commercialized by Allergan plc)
Namzaric (memantine hydrochloride extended release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of an Alzheimer’s type is currently marketed by Forest, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc, in the United States. We are eligible to receive royalties on net sales of Namzaric beginning in May of 2020.
License agreement with Allergan
In November 2012, we granted Allergan an exclusive license, with right to sublicense, to certain of our intellectual property rights relating to human therapeutics containing memantine in the United States. In connection with these rights, Allergan markets and sells Namzaric and Namenda XR for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer’s disease. Pursuant to the agreement, Allergan made an upfront payment of $65.0 million. We earned and received additional cash payments totaling $95.0 million upon achievement by Allergan of certain development and regulatory milestones. Under the agreement, external costs incurred related to the prosecution and litigation of intellectual property rights are reimbursable.
We are entitled to receive royalties on net sales in the United States by Allergan, its affiliates, or any of its sublicensees of controlled-release versions of memantine products covered by the terms of the license agreement. Beginning in May 2020, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low double digits to mid-teens from Allergan for sales of Namzaric in the United States. Based on 2019 net sales of Namzaric, we expect the tiered royalty to be in the low double digits through the term of the agreement. At this point, we will not receive royalties on sales of Namenda XR because of the entry of multiple generic versions of Namenda XR in 2018. Allergan’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to fixed-dose memantine-donepezil products, including Namzaric, continues until the later of (i) 15 years after the commercial launch of the first fixed-dose memantine-donepezil product by Allergan in the United States or (ii) the expiration of the Orange Book listed patents for which Allergan obtained rights from us covering such product. However, Allergan’s obligation to pay royalties for any product covered by the license is eliminated in any quarter where there is significant competition from generics. For further information, see Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in “Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.
Intellectual property
Our discoveries and products are protected by a robust intellectual product portfolio and available regulatory exclusivities. In developing therapies, we search for clinically meaningful treatment effects, including from existing medicines.
As with any pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, our success significantly depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity for our products, product candidates, and any in- and out-licensed programs, including GOCOVRI, Namzaric, ADS-5102, and ADS-4101. These protections may include regulatory exclusivity, patent 
protection, unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and/or continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
We actively protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to intellectual property” and Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in “Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies.”
As of February 1, 2020, we owned 25 issued U.S. patents, ten U.S. patent applications, as well as additional patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions. The patent portfolios for GOCOVRI, ADS-4101 and Namzaric as of February 1, 2020, are summarized below:
GOCOVRI
GOCOVRI is currently covered for its FDA-approved indication and other indications Adamas is actively studying by a total of 14 issued U.S. patents and five additional patent applications containing method and composition claims relating to their pharmacokinetic profile and dosing of amantadine. These issued patents expire through 2034 and applications, if issued, expire as late as 2038. These patents and patent applications are wholly owned by us and are not subject to any license agreements. We also own additional foreign patent applications covering GOCOVRI. On December 30, 2019, as part of a litigation settlement, we granted Sandoz a license to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import a generic version of GOCOVRI (amantadine) extended release capsules (including for any new indications approved under the GOCOVRI NDA), effective as of March 4, 2030, or earlier in certain circumstances typical for such agreements. The agreement contains provisions that may accelerate the license date, including if unit sales of GOCOVRI for the 12-month period ending July 31, 2025 or any subsequent 12-month period decline by a specified percentage below GOCOVRI unit sales for the current year ending December 31, 2019. For more information, please see Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in “Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies.”
ADS-4101
ADS-4101 is currently covered by U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications containing method and composition claims relating to their pharmacokinetic profile and dosing of antiepileptic agents. Patents issuing from these applications, if issued, will expire at least as late as 2036. These patent applications are wholly owned by us and are not subject to any license agreements.
Namzaric
Namzaric is covered by a total of seven of our issued U.S. patents containing method and compositions claims relating to the pharmacokinetic profile and dosing of memantine. These patents expire as late as 2029 and are exclusively licensed to Allergan. We also own additional foreign patents and patent applications covering Namzaric.
Commercial activities, including sales and marketing
We commenced the full commercial launch of GOCOVRI in January 2018. In connection with this launch, we deployed a sales force of approximately 60 neurology account specialists plus six regional business directors. A significant portion of our operating expenses in 2019 were, and we expect that a significant portion of our operating expenses in 2020 will be, related to our commercialization activities. For 2019, 2018 and 2017, sales of GOCOVRI accounted for over 99% of our revenues.
We sell GOCOVRI to a specialty pharmacy and certain limited specialty distributors, which we collectively refer to as our customers. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our largest customer, Alliance Rx Walgreens Prime, or AllianceRx, was responsible for approximately 98% and 99% of our product revenue, respectively. We have a product purchase agreement with Walgreen Co., acting on behalf of itself and its specialty pharmacy affiliates, including AllianceRx, through which AllianceRx purchases its supply of GOCOVRI. The agreement provides that AllianceRx has the nonexclusive right to purchase GOCOVRI from us or our authorized distributors solely to 
dispense to patients in the United States and Puerto Rico, and that AllianceRx will purchase GOCOVRI only from us or our authorized distributors. There are no minimum purchase requirements under the product purchase agreement. We do not believe the loss of this customer would significantly impact the ability to distribute our product as we believe alternative distributors are available.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions, and others.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer, or less costly than any that will be commercialized by us. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop, and manage a portfolio of drugs that are safer, more efficacious, and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies.
GOCOVRI®
The commercialization of new pharmaceutical products is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition with respect to GOCOVRI. For example, although GOCOVRI is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, we face competition from various branded and generic drugs approved for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease that physicians either have historically used or may use in an attempt to manage dyskinesia. Competition may arise from all versions of levodopa (Sinemet (Merck & Co., Inc.), Parcopa (Schwartz Pharma), Rytary (Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), Duopa (AbbVie), Inbrija (Acorda)); dopamine agonists (subcutaneous apomorphine, Requip XL (GlaxoSmithKline plc), Mirapex and Mirapex ER (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc.), Neupro Patch (UCB SA/NV)); MAOB inhibitors (selegiline (Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), Azilect (Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd.), Xadago (Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A.)); adenosine receptor antagonist (Nourianz (Kyowa Kirin, Inc.)); and other versions of amantadine (Symmetrel (Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) - amantadine immediate release, Osmolex ER (Osmotica Pharmaceuticals, LLC) - amantadine extended release).
We will also face competition from investigational drugs in late stage development for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, if approved, including product candidates from Mitsubishi Tanabe, Bial-Portela CSA, Genervon Biopharmaceuticals, Pharma Two B, Neurocrine, and Sunovion. GOCOVRI may also face competition from drugs currently in development for dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease or for Parkinson’s disease from a number of pharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Neurolixis, Amarantus BioScience, Addex Pharma, and Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
Many of our competitors, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies that compete directly with us, have significantly greater financial resources commercializing approved products than we do. Also, many of our competitors are large pharmaceutical companies that will have a greater ability to reduce prices for their competing drugs in an effort to gain market share and undermine the value proposition that we might otherwise be able to offer to payers.
Namzaric
In the market for Alzheimer’s disease treatments, Namzaric competes or will compete with branded and generic products such as galantamine, rivastigmine, memantine, and donepezil. In addition, Allergan currently markets Namenda, the immediate-release version of memantine, which physicians and patients may favor instead of Namzaric. Generic versions of memantine, including generic versions of Namenda XR, extended release memantine, are currently available to patients. Several generic manufacturers have or are currently seeking regulatory approval or have received regulatory approval to market generic versions of Namzaric, although generic versions of Namzaric are not currently available to patients. We and our partner Allergan continue enforcement of our patent rights with respect to this product. We are also aware that other biopharmaceutical companies are developing treatments for Alzheimer’s disease that may 
compete with Namzaric. See Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in “Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report for more information.
Manufacturing
We currently have no manufacturing facilities. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk drug substance and finished drug products required for commercialization of GOCOVRI and to supply our clinical trials of ADS-5102. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers to manufacture commercial quantities of GOCOVRI and ADS-5102, and for any other product candidates we may pursue, if and when we receive approval for marketing by the applicable regulatory authorities. With respect to GOCOVRI and ADS-5102, we are seeking to qualify additional manufacturers of both bulk drug substance and finished drug products.
GOCOVRI, ADS-5102 and ADS-4101 are based upon controlled release coated pellet technology and can be difficult to manufacture. These products consist of an inert core, a drug layer, an optional seal coating, and controlled release coatings. Our products are made in a fluidized bed coating machine in sequential steps. Once the extended or modified release coating is applied, the coated pellets are tested to ensure that the desired dissolution rate is achieved. These coatings are relatively thin, and susceptible to changes in raw materials, temperature, humidity, and other manufacturing process parameters.
Allergan is responsible for all manufacturing related to Namzaric.
Our third-party manufacturers, their facilities, and all lots of drug substance and drug products used commercially or in our clinical trials are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products.
Government regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;
•submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;
•pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with cGMP and Good Clinical Practices; and
•FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
•Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.
•Phase 2—Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3—These clinical trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
NDA submission, review and approval by the FDA
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) provides two pathways for the approval of new drugs through an NDA. An NDA under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA is a comprehensive application to support approval of a product candidate that includes, among other things, data and information to demonstrate that the proposed drug is safe and effective for its proposed uses, that production methods are adequate to ensure its identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug, and that proposed labeling is appropriate and contains all necessary information. A 505(b)(1) NDA contains results of the full set of preclinical and clinical studies conducted by or on behalf of the applicant to characterize and evaluate the product candidate.
Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to obtain FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the 
filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely to some extent upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference listed drug (“RLD”), and submit its own product-specific data-which may include data from preclinical or clinical studies conducted by or on behalf of the applicant-to address differences between the product candidate and the RLD. GOCOVRI and product candidates based upon ADS-5102 are based on an already approved active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”). Accordingly, we expect to be able to rely on information from previously conducted studies involving our ADS-5102 formulation in our clinical development plans and our NDA submissions.
The submission of an NDA under either Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2) generally requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. For some NDAs, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to seek insights and recommendations on issues relevant to approval of the application. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and such REMS can be imposed either at the time of approval or subsequent to a product’s marketing. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug or biological product in relevant pediatric populations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. 
Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA, the FDA’s goal for review of an NDA is based upon goals set under annual user fee guidance, although the review process can be and often is significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification. Upon completion of its review, the FDA will respond to the applicant by approving the application or issuing a Complete Response letter. A Complete Response letter outlines deficiencies in the NDA and may request additional information, including additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if an applicant submits this additional information, the FDA may determine that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor. The timing of approval, if any, of any NDA we submit will depend on when the FDA determines that the NDA satisfies all requirements for approval. Also, even if the FDA approves an NDA, such approval may entail limitations on the uses or conditions for which such product may be marketed, or the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product, and may further limit the marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. The FDA may withdraw approval of an NDA if the sponsor does not comply with extensive post-marketing regulatory requirements (as described below) or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, established two abbreviated approval pathways for pharmaceutical products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved products: the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, described above, and the abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) pathway. To facilitate these abbreviated approval pathways, NDA applicants are required to list the FDA information concerning certain patents with claims that cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA and upon the issuance of any new patent claims that meet the requirements for submission to the FDA, the NDA holder is required to update the information and submit any new information concerning applicable patents, which will then be published in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA (1) that no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) that such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant provides a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the 
competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the RLD and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. If the NDA holder or patent owner files a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the date the NDA or patent holder receives notice of the certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. If a listed patent claims a method of using the approved drug, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may, instead of submitting a certification to the patent, submit a “Section viii” statement certifying that the labeling for the proposed product does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use. We have received notices of an ANDA submitted to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market generic versions of GOCOVRI, and have recently entered into a settlement agreement with that ANDA filer. For further information, see Litigation and Legal Proceedings in “Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. If a product is a new chemical entity, or NCE-generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug-there is a period of five years from the product’s approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor makes a Paragraph IV certification challenging a listed patent. Because of relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as the time it takes for the FDA to review and approve an application, five-year NCE exclusivity usually effectively means an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is not approved for a period well beyond five years after approval of the RLD.
A product, like GOCOVRI, that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if the NDA contains clinical data that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA may not grant final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data. For example, if an NDA is submitted for a product that seeks approval for a new indication, and clinical data were required to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the product for that use, the FDA could not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for another product with that active moiety for that use.
Orphan Drug designation and exclusivity
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug or biologic is intended to treat a rare disease or condition and meets other qualifying criteria, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. In general, a drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, and during that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. GOCOVRI has been granted orphan drug exclusivity until August 24, 2024 for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications. 
Post-approval requirements
Any drug products we manufacture, market, or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. For example, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities, including by the FDA for compliance with cGMP, which imposes significant manufacturing-related requirements. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. If we or our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with FDA requirements, for example, the FDA may take enforcement action, including, but not limited to, halting our clinical trials, requiring us to recall a product from distribution, or seeking to withdraw approval of an NDA or other necessary licenses.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company’s promotional claims about the safety and efficacy of its drug products must be consistent with FDA-approved labeling, truthful, and non-misleading. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may legally prescribe approved drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such “off-label” use is common in some areas of medicine and reflects physicians’ professional judgment that such use is an appropriate treatment option for patients under certain circumstances. The FDA does not regulate physicians’ practice of medicine, but the FDA does restrict manufacturers’ communications about their drug products, including communications about unapproved uses of approved products.
In addition to these post-marketing requirements, companies that manufacture or distribute drug products or that hold approved NDAs must comply with numerous other post-marketing regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. 
The extensive laws and regulations that apply to the research, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising, and promotion of drug products and product candidates in the United States are subject to change, and it is difficult to foresee whether, how, and when such changes may affect our business.
Other healthcare regulations
Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act, and similar state laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. We seek to comply with these exceptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our business practices may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor or if there is no exception or safe harbor available. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated or subject to lawsuits by whistleblowers and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
We and our business activities are subject to the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Additionally, the federal Open Payments program requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the federal government information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. These include state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states; restrict when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to prescribers or engage in other marketing related activities; report pricing with respect to certain drug products and/or require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. In addition, certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Outside the U.S., we may be subject to similar regulations in those countries where we market and sell products.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that negatively affects our business. In addition, healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”). HIPAA and its implementing regulations impose certain requirements on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we will have to comply with the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (“VHCA”). The VHCA requires manufacturers to offer their covered drugs (biologics and single source and innovator multiple source drugs) for sale to certain federal agencies, including but not limited to, the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), on a Federal Supply Schedule contract, at a price no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”). The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we will have to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, the Federal Supply Schedule contract requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws.
Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including significant criminal, civil, and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the 
government, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) was passed, which has substantially changed how health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and has significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA, among other things, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”) are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the MDRP, extended the MDRP to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and provided for a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
There remain legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminates, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain PPACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the PPACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which ended the use of the statutory formula for clinician payment and established a quality payment program. At this time it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement.
In addition, there have also been proposals to impose federal rebates on Medicare Part D drugs, requiring federally-mandated rebates on all drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D enrollees or on only those drugs dispensed to certain groups of lower income beneficiaries. If any of these proposals are adopted, they could result in our owing additional rebates, which could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of our products.
There has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump Administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. While some of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control or reduce drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, have been designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize. There have also been proposals to impose federal rebates on Medicare Part D drugs, requiring federally-mandated rebates on all drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D enrollees or on only those drugs dispensed to certain groups of lower income beneficiaries. If any of these proposals are adopted, they could result in us owing additional rebates, which could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize.
Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement
Our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, will depend in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the U.S., governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. We intend to participate in and then will have certain price reporting and other obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and other governmental pricing programs. These obligations are discussed in greater detail under the heading “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs that we may join if we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize profitably. We expect to experience pricing pressure in the U.S. in connection with the sale of our products due to managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, additional legislative proposals to curb healthcare costs, and negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases generally, which could limit the prices that we charge for any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize, limit our commercial opportunity, and/or negatively impact 
revenues from sales of our products. We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs, particularly given the current atmosphere of mounting criticism of prescription costs in the U.S. These cost containment measures include controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government health care programs; pharmaceutical cost transparency bills that aim to require drug companies to justify their prices; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; changes in drug importation laws; expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third-party payers to make coverage and payment decisions. For example, much attention has been paid to legislation proposing federal rebates on Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage utilization for drugs issued to certain groups of lower income beneficiaries and the desire to change the provisions that treat these dual-eligible patients differently from traditional Medicare patients. Any such changes could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize.
Coverage, reimbursement, and formulary placement decisions are being negotiated on a plan by plan basis for GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease. Coverage, reimbursements, and placement decisions for products are based on many factors including the coverage, reimbursement, and placement of already marketed branded drugs for the same or similar indications, the safety and efficacy of the product, availability of generics for similar indications, and the clinical need for the product. Within the Medicare program, as self-administered drugs, GOCOVRI would be reimbursed under the expanded prescription drug benefit, known as Medicare Part D. This program is a voluntary Medicare benefit administered by private plans that operate under contracts with the federal government. These Part D plans negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers, which are passed on to each of the plan’s enrollees. Historically, Part D beneficiaries have been exposed to significant out-of-pocket costs after they surpass an annual coverage limit and until they reach a catastrophic coverage threshold. However, changes made by recent legislation will reduce this patient coverage gap, known as the “donut hole”, by transitioning patient responsibility in that coverage range from 100% in 2010 to only 25% currently. To help achieve this reduction, since 2011, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay quarterly discounts of 50% off the negotiated price of branded drugs issued to Medicare Part D patients in the donut hole, and such quarterly discounts have increased to 70% on January 1, 2019. In 2020, drug manufacturers will be responsible for a larger share of total drug costs due to an increase to the catastrophic coverage threshold. Such increase will also result in a higher out-of-pocket costs paid by Part D beneficiaries.
If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, as applicable, as well as with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, or the OBRA, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or the VHCA, each as amended. Among other things, the OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.
Third-party payers decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Even with studies, any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize may be considered less safe, less effective, or less cost-effective than other products, and third-party payers may not provide coverage and reimbursement for any of our product candidates that we commercialize, in whole or in part. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. For example, third-party payers have started to require discounts and/or exclusivity arrangements with some drug manufacturers in exchange for including a specific product on their formularies. Any such requirements could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of our products.
Payers also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. Both Medicare and Medicaid are administered by CMS. CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It is difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payers to cover our products.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
