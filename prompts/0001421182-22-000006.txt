Item 1.  Business

In this report, the term “Verso,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Verso Corporation, which is the ultimate parent entity and the issuer of Class A common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and its consolidated subsidiaries. Verso is the sole member of Verso Holding LLC, which is the sole member of Verso Paper Holding LLC. As used in this report, the term “Verso Holding” refers to Verso Holding LLC, and the term “Verso Paper” refers to Verso Paper Holding LLC. 
Overview

We are a leading North American producer of coated paper, shipped in both roll and sheet formats, which is used primarily in printing applications to produce high-end advertising brochures, catalogs and magazines among other media and marketing publications as well as specialty and packaging applications. We also produce and sell Northern Bleached Hardwood Kraft, or “NBHK” pulp, which is used to manufacture printing and writing paper grades and tissue products.
As of the date of this report, we operate three paper machines at our mill in Escanaba, Michigan and one paper machine and one NBHK pulp machine at our mill in Quinnesec, Michigan. The mills are fully integrated, in that they produce the majority of the pulp and energy needed for their paper production, and they are located in close proximity to the major printing markets. The mills have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 1,400,000 tons of paper and NBHK pulp. We also operate a sheeting facility in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin to convert paper produced at our Michigan mills to sheets for the commercial print market.
We sell and market our products to approximately 200 customers which comprise approximately 900 end-user accounts. We have long-standing relationships with many leading paper merchants, commercial printers, brokers, magazine and catalog publishers, and specialty retail merchandisers. Our relationships with many of our large customers average more than 20 years. We reach end-users through several distribution channels, including direct sales, commercial printers, paper merchants and brokers. Our NBHK pulp sales are handled through direct relationships and brokers.
Recent Developments
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On December 19, 2021, or the “Agreement Date,” we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the “Merger Agreement,” with BillerudKorsnäs Inc., a Delaware corporation, or the “Parent,” West Acquisition Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, or “Merger Sub,” and, solely for purposes of certain sections thereof (as specified therein), BillerudKorsnäs AB, a Swedish limited company, which we refer to as “Guarantor” or “BillerudKorsnäs.” Parent is a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Verso, with Verso surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
The closing of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including: (a) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, (b) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the “HSR Act,” (c) receipt of certain regulatory approvals set forth in the Merger Agreement, (d) the absence of any law or governmental order or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger, (e) the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties, (f) the other party’s compliance in all material respects with its covenants under the Merger Agreement and (g) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) since the Agreement Date. On January 11, 2022, Verso and BillerudKorsnäs made the filings required to be made under the HSR Act, and the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired on February 10, 2022. Subject to the satisfaction of the remaining closing conditions, we expect to close the Merger by the second quarter 2022. 
For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to our filings previously made with the SEC in connection with the proposed Merger, including our definitive proxy statement filed on February 8, 2022 and the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.2 to this report. 
Because the Merger is not yet complete, and except as otherwise specifically stated, the descriptions and disclosures presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K assume the continuation of Verso as a public company.
See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sale of Duluth Mill
On May 13, 2021, Verso Minnesota Wisconsin LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Verso, entered into an asset purchase agreement with ST Paper 1, LLC and sold all of the assets primarily related to our Duluth Mill located in Duluth, Minnesota for $7 million in cash less costs to sell of $1 million. The sale, including related sale costs, resulted in a loss of $3 million included in Other operating (income) expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Changes to Executive Officers
On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors appointed Randy J. Nebel as our President and Chief Executive Officer, prior to which he served as our interim President and Chief Executive Officer since September 30, 2020.
Allen J. Campbell, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, retired effective June 30, 2021.
On April 5, 2021, Matthew M. Archambeau resigned as our Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Energy.
On May 6, 2021, the Board of Directors appointed Kevin M. Kuznicki as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.
On June 4, 2021, the Board of Directors appointed Brian D. Cullen to serve as Verso’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective June 16, 2021.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our operations and financial results since the first quarter of 2020 and continues to have an impact on us. We serve as an essential manufacturing business and, as a result, we have continued to be operational during the pandemic in order to meet the ongoing needs of our customers, including those in other essential business sectors, which provide food, medical and hygiene products needed in a global health crisis. However, the guidelines and orders enacted by federal, state and local governments in 2020 impacted demand from retailers, political campaigns, and sports and entertainment events, driving reduced purchases of printed materials and substantially impacting our graphic paper business.
There continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to the resurgence of new and more contagious variants of the virus; the efficacy of the vaccines introduced to combat the virus and the public acceptance of such vaccines; and the impact of COVID-19 on economic conditions, including with respect to labor market conditions, economic activity, consumer behavior, supply chain shortages and disruptions and inflationary pressure; all of which could have a material impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
While we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, we saw our sales, volume and prices continue to recover during 2021. 
History
We began operations on August 1, 2006, when we acquired the assets and certain liabilities comprising the business of the Coated and Supercalendered Papers Division of International Paper. We were formed for the purpose of consummating the acquisition from International Paper. We completed our initial public offering of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2008.
Industry

Coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications, including catalogs, magazines and commercial printing applications, which include high-end advertising brochures and direct mail advertising. Demand is generally driven by North American advertising and print media trends. The coated paper industry has been facing a decline in demand driven primarily by the growth in digital media (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Industry - The printing and writing paper industry has been facing a long-term structural decline and our profitability may continue to be adversely impacted by such decline”).
In North America, coated paper is classified by brightness and falls into five grades, labeled No. 1 to No. 5, with No. 1 having the highest brightness level and No. 5 having the lowest brightness level. Papers graded No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 are typically coated freesheet grades. No. 4 and No. 5 papers are predominantly grades containing groundwood. Coated groundwood grades are the preferred grades for catalogs and magazines, while coated freesheet is more commonly used in commercial print applications.
Within the paper industry, specialty paper consists of products which are given unique characteristics in their manufacturing, converting or processing and that have properties suitable for special purposes or custom engineered applications. Specialty paper has unique functional properties and is usually produced in relatively small quantities for a specific product, function or end-use requirement. Commercial and development activities rely largely on defining the unique characteristics of an application, in contrast with other substrates. We have focused on label and converting, flexible packaging and technical paper applications within the specialty paper market. 
In 2021 demand for our products saw improvement over 2020, which was significantly impacted by COVID-19. Due to improved economic conditions, print demand held momentum through 2021. Due to reductions in capacity in 2020, the industry operating rates exceeded 100% causing significant reductions in the mills and customers inventories. Imports were hampered by logistical issues and lingering effects of COVID-19 which contributed to the tight marketing conditions. Verso’s backlogs were strong through 2021 and nearly all of our products were on some form of allocation throughout the year.
Products

We manufacture paper products that serve the graphic and specialty paper markets. In addition, we manufacture pulp for both internal use and external sales.
Graphic paper. The graphic paper market includes coated freesheet, uncoated freesheet, coated groundwood and supercalendered paper. We produce Coated Freesheet and Coated Groundwood No. 4 grades for our customers. Freesheet paper is made from bleached kraft pulp, which is produced using a chemical process to break apart wood fibers and dissolve impurities such as lignin. The use of bleached kraft pulp results in a bright, smooth paper with excellent print qualities. Coated freesheet paper contains primarily kraft pulp with less than 10% mechanical pulp in its composition, and is therefore well-suited for high-end commercial applications, premium magazines, catalogs and direct mail. Groundwood paper includes a fiber component produced through a mechanical pulping process. The use of such fiber results in a bulkier and more opaque paper that is better suited for applications where lighter weights and/or higher stiffness are required. In addition to mechanical pulp, groundwood paper typically includes a kraft pulp component to improve brightness and print quality. Groundwood paper is coated (coated groundwood) for higher quality applications such as catalogs and magazines. Graphic paper revenues have been declining primarily due to the focus on digital media as opposed to traditional print advertising. Revenues from our graphic paper sales represented 60%, 66% and 68% of our total annual net sales for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Specialty paper. We offer product solutions for our customers by producing paper grades used as labels for packaging, canned goods and other related applications. Revenues from our specialty paper sales represented 31%, 20% and 19% of our total annual net sales for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Packaging paper. We produce heavy weight coated freesheet grades for use in higher-end packaging and printing applications such as greeting cards, book covers, folders, labels and point-of-purchase displays. Revenues from our packaging paper sales represented 4%, 5% and 2% of our total annual net sales for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Pulp. We produce and sell NBHK pulp. NBHK pulp is produced through the chemical kraft process using hardwoods. Hardwoods typically have shorter length fibers than softwoods and are used in a variety of end-use applications. NBHK describes pulp produced using a chemical process, whereby hardwood chips are combined with chemicals and steam to separate the wood fibers. The fibers are then washed and pressure screened to remove the chemicals and lignin which originally held the fibers together. Finally, the pulp is bleached to the necessary whiteness and brightness. NBHK pulp is used in applications 
where a brighter and whiter fiber based product is required. We can also offer Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft pulp, de-inked recycled pulp and unbleached virgin kraft pulp to help meet specific customer requirements. Revenues from our pulp sales represented 5%, 9% and 11% of our total annual net sales for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Manufacturing
We operate three paper machines at our mill in Escanaba, Michigan and one paper machine and one NBHK pulp machine at our mill in Quinnesec, Michigan. The mills have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 1,400,000 tons of paper and NBHK pulp. In 2019, we shut down our paper mill in Luke, Maryland and agreed to sell our Androscoggin Mill located in Jay, Maine and our Stevens Point Mill located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin to Pixelle, which closed on February 10, 2020. In July 2020, we indefinitely idled our mills in Duluth, Minnesota and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, but continue to operate the sheeting facility at our Wisconsin Rapids mill to convert paper produced at our Michigan mills to sheets for the commercial print market. Our facilities are strategically located within close proximity to major publication printing customers, which affords us the ability to deliver our products more quickly and cost-effectively.
The following table provides key information about our mills and operating paper machines’ capacity as of the date of this report.

Mill/Location | Product/Paper Grades | Paper/Market PulpMachines | | Annual ProductionCapacity(in tons)
Escanaba, Michigan | Coated, specialty and uncoated paper | | 3 | | 730,000
Quinnesec, Michigan | Coated paper and NBHK pulp | | 2 | | 670,000
Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin (idled)(1) | Coated and packaging papers | | 2 | | 540,000

(1) Wisconsin Rapids Mill annual paper production capacity of 540,000 is not included in our total paper production capacity. On February 8, 2021, we decided to permanently shut down the No. 14 paper machine and certain other long-lived assets at our Wisconsin Rapids Mill, which permanently reduced annual production capacity by approximately 185,000 tons of coated paper.
The basic raw material of the papermaking process is wood pulp. The first stage of papermaking involves converting trees to pulp through either a mechanical or chemical process. Before trees can be processed into pulp, they are passed through a debarking drum to remove the bark and be chipped. Once separated, the bark is burned as fuel in bark boilers. The trees are composed of small cellulose fibers which are bound together by a glue-like substance called lignin. The cellulose fibers are then separated from each other through either a mechanical or a kraft pulping process.

After the pulping phase, the fiber furnish is delivered onto the forming fabric of the paper machine. On the forming fabric, the fibers become interlaced, forming a mat of paper, and much of the water is extracted. The paper web then goes through a pressing and drying process to extract the remaining water. After drying, the web goes through a series of on machine and off machine finishing and converting processes that impact product specific attributes to ensure excellent downstream performance. Finally, the paper is wrapped, labeled and shipped.
Our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Consolidated Water Power Company, or “CWPCo,” has 33.3 megawatts of generating capacity on 39 generators located in five hydroelectric plants on the Wisconsin River. CWPCo is a regulated public utility that provides electricity to our Wisconsin Rapids facility, and a small number of industrial, light commercial and residential customers.
We utilize a continuous improvement process to lower our cost position and enhance operating efficiency through reduced consumption of energy and material inputs, reduced spending on indirect costs and improved productivity, product quality and safety. The program utilizes benchmarking data to identify improvement initiatives and establish performance targets. Detailed action plans are used to monitor the execution of these initiatives and calculate the amount saved. We also use multi-variable analysis, lean manufacturing, center of excellence teams, source-of-loss initiatives and best practice sharing to constantly improve our manufacturing processes and products. Since 2001, the Quinnesec Mill has been recognized in the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Voluntary Protection Program as a Star facility. The Michigan Voluntary Protection Program Star award is the state’s highest recognition for workplace safety programs and performance. Each year we develop and implement new efforts to continue our safety improvement and share our successes through the mentoring aspects of this important program.
Raw Materials and Suppliers

Our key cost inputs in the papermaking process are wood fiber, wood pulp, chemicals and energy.

Wood Fiber. We source our wood fiber from a broad group of timberland and sawmill owners located in the regions around our mills. Our cost to purchase wood is affected directly by the market price of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the variability of fuel cost for the logging and transportation of timber to our facilities. While we have fiber supply agreements in place that ensure delivery of a substantial portion of our wood requirements, purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates. 

Wood Pulp. We source bleached wood pulp from market producers to supplement fiber requirements at our mills. The primary pulp procured is Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft, or “NBSK.” We expect weather events and imbalances in supply and demand to create volatility in prices for NBSK from time to time.
Chemicals. Chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated paper include latex, clay, starch, calcium carbonate, caustic soda, sodium chlorate and titanium dioxide. We purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs. We expect imbalances in supply and demand and weather events to periodically create volatility in prices and supply for certain chemicals.
Energy. We produce a significant portion of our energy needs for our paper mills from sources such as waste wood, waste heat recovery, liquid biomass from our pulping process and internal energy cogeneration facilities. Our external energy purchases include fuel oil, natural gas, coal and electricity. Our overall energy expenditures are mitigated by our internal energy production capacity and ability to switch between certain energy sources. The use of derivative contracts is also considered as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We reach our end-users through several channels, including merchants, brokers, printers and direct sales to end-users. We sell our products to approximately 200 customers which comprise approximately 900 end-user accounts. 
Sales to End-Users. In 2021, we sold 31% of our paper products directly to end-users, most of which are specialty converters and catalog and magazine publishers. These customers are typically large, sophisticated buyers who have the scale, resources and expertise to procure paper directly from manufacturers. Customers for our NBHK pulp products are mostly other paper manufacturers.

Sales to Brokers and Merchants. Our largest indirect paper sales by volume are through brokers and merchants who resell the paper to end-users. In 2021, our sales to brokers and merchants represented 52% of our net sales. Brokers typically act as an intermediary between paper manufacturers and smaller end-users who do not have the scale or resources to cost effectively procure paper directly from manufacturers. The majority of the paper sold to brokers is resold to catalog publishers. We work closely with brokers to achieve market share in the catalog, magazine and insert end-user markets through collaborative selling.

Merchants are similar to brokers in that they act as an intermediary between the manufacturer and the end-user. However, merchants generally take physical delivery of the product and keep inventory on hand. Merchants tend to deal with smaller end-users that lack the scale to warrant direct delivery from the manufacturer. Coated freesheet comprises the majority of our sales to merchants. In most cases, because they are relatively small, the ultimate end-users of paper sold through merchants are generally regional or local commercial printers.
Sales to Printers. In 2021, our sales to printers represented 17% of our net sales. The majority of these sales were to the two largest publication printers in the United States. Printers also effectively act as an intermediary between manufacturers and end-users in that they directly source paper for printing/converting and then resell it to their customers as a finished product.

The majority of our paper products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facilities to the printer or converter, regardless of the sales channel. In addition, we maintain a network of distribution centers located in the West, Midwest, South and Northeast close to our customer base to provide quick delivery. The majority of our NBHK pulp is delivered to our customers’ paper mills.

Our sales force is organized around our sales channels. We maintain an active dialogue with all of our major customers and track product performance and demand across grades. We have a team of sales representatives and marketing professionals organized into three major sales groups that correspond with our sales channels: direct sales support; support to brokers and merchants; and printer support.

Many of our customers provide us with forecasts, which allows us to plan our production runs in advance, optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency. Generally, our sales agreements do not extend beyond the calendar year, and they typically provide for quarterly or semiannual price adjustments based on market price movements.
Customers

We have developed long-standing relationships with many premier customers. Our relationships with our ten largest customers average more than 20 years. Our two largest customers, Central National-Gottesman and Veritiv Corporation, together accounted for 24% of our net sales in 2021. In 2021, our ten largest customers (including Central National-Gottesman and Veritiv Corporation) together accounted for 62% of our net sales. Our key customers in the graphic paper market include Central National-Gottesman, Veritiv Corporation, Midland Paper and RR Donnelley. Our key customers in the specialty paper market include Avery Dennison, UPM Raflatac and Green Bay Packaging.
Seasonality

We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly net sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These seasonal factors are common in the coated paper industry. Our third and fourth quarters are generally our strongest quarters for volume and revenue, reflecting an increase in printing related to end-of-year magazines, increased end-of-year direct mailings, and holiday season catalogs. Our working capital and accounts receivable generally peak in the third quarter, while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the third quarter season. We expect our seasonality trends to continue for the foreseeable future.
Research and Development

The primary function of our research and development efforts is to work with customers in developing and modifying products to accommodate their evolving needs and to identify cost-saving opportunities within our operations. Over the past several years, examples of our research and development efforts include innovative and performance-driven products for the graphic and specialty markets and the successful transfer of products within our manufacturing platform to create flexibility and maximize margin within our operations.
Intellectual Property

We have several patents and patent applications in the United States and various foreign countries. These patents and patent applications generally relate to various paper manufacturing methods and equipment which may become commercially viable in the future. We also have trademarks for our name, Verso®, as well as for our products such as Sterling®, Futura®, Anthem Plus®, Productolith®, Influence®, Liberty® and Voyager®. In addition to the intellectual property that we own, we license a significant portion of the intellectual property used in our business on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive basis from International Paper.
Competition
Our business is highly competitive. A significant number of North American competitors produce coated paper, specialty paper, packaging paper and NBHK pulp, and several overseas manufacturers export to North America. We compete based on a number of factors, including price, product availability, product quality, customer service, breadth of product offerings, timeliness of product delivery, market presence and degree of forward integration.
Foreign competition in North America is affected by the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies’ market prices in North America and other markets, worldwide supply and demand and the cost of ocean-going freight.

While our product offering is broad in terms of grades produced (from coated and uncoated graphical grades, including web and sheeted products, to highly technical specialty grades), our largest offering is in the coated freesheet category, with about two-thirds in web form and one-third in sheets. This strategy is driven primarily by our alignment with the commercial print market with a secondary focus on catalogs and magazines for our coated freesheet grades.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,600 employees of which 52% are represented by eight union locals of six different international unions. We believe that we offer competitive compensation (including salary and incentive compensation) and benefits packages for all of our employees. We know that our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We believe that internal promotion and key employee retention are critical components to our long-term success. From professional development opportunities to leadership training, we have development programs and online opportunities to cultivate talent throughout the Company. 
We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in better, more innovative products and services and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. We are committed to compliance with all applicable federal, state and local employment laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship, national origin, disability, military or veteran status and any other protected classifications.
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations

We are subject to a wide range of federal, state, regional and local general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including without limitation the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or “Clean Water Act,” the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or “CERCLA,” the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Emergency Planning & Community Right-To-Know Act, the Oil Pollution Act and similar state and local laws. In the future, we may be subject to additional federal, state, regional, local or supranational legislation related to climate change and greenhouse gas controls.
Among our activities subject to environmental regulation are the emissions of air pollutants, discharges of wastewater and stormwater, operation of dams, storage, handling, treatment and disposal of materials and waste, and remediation of soil, surface water and ground water contamination. Many environmental and health and safety laws and regulations provide for substantial fines or penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for any failure to comply. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant costs for abatement measures, the interruption of our operations and/or facility shutdowns.
Certain environmental laws, such as CERCLA and similar state laws, provide for strict liability, and under certain circumstances joint and several liability, for investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous substances into the environment, including without limitation soil and groundwater. These laws may apply to properties presently or formerly owned or operated by or presently or formerly under the charge, management or control of an entity or its predecessors, as well as to conditions at properties at which waste attributable to an entity or its predecessors was disposed. Under environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property or a party formerly or previously in charge, management or control of real property and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of at real property, may be held liable for the cost to investigate or clean up that real property and for related damages to natural resources. We handle and dispose of wastes arising from our mill operations, including disposal at on-site landfills. We are required to maintain financial assurance (in the form of letters of credit and other similar instruments) for the expected cost of landfill closure and post-closure care. We could be subject to liability, including liability for investigation and cleanup costs, if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former paper mills or another location where we have disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, wastes. 
Permits are required for the operation of our mills and related facilities. Most such permits are subject to periodic renewal, and all are subject to modification and revocation. We and others have the right to challenge our permit conditions through administrative and legal appeals and review processes. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with the permits, and violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, injunctions or both. Other parties also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance with the permits.
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We have made, and will continue to make, significant expenditures to comply with these requirements and our permits. We incurred environmental capital expenditures of $3 million, $1 million and $3 million in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
We could be subject to potentially significant fines, penalties, criminal sanctions, mill shutdowns, or interruptions in operations for failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
