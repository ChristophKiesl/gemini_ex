During fiscal 2022, we had total shipment volumes of 4,080 kt and net sales of $17.1 billion.
Our History
Organization and Description of Business
Novelis was formed in Canada on September 21, 2004. On May 15, 2007, Novelis was acquired by Hindalco. All of the outstanding shares of Novelis are owned directly by AV Metals Inc. and indirectly by Hindalco. We produce aluminum plate, sheet, and light gauge products for use in the packaging market, which includes beverage and food can and foil products, as well as for use in the automotive, transportation, aerospace, electronics, architectural, and industrial product markets. As of March 31, 2022, we had manufacturing operations in nine countries on four continents: North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, with 33 operating facilities, which may include any combination of hot or cold rolling, finishing, casting, or recycling capabilities. We have recycling operations in 15 of our operating facilities to recycle post-consumer aluminum, such as UBCs, and post-industrial aluminum, such as class scrap.
Our Industry
The aluminum rolled products market represents the global supply of, and demand for, aluminum sheet, plate, and foil produced either from sheet ingot or continuously cast roll-stock in rolling mills operated by both independent aluminum rolled products producers and integrated aluminum companies.
Aluminum rolled products are semi-finished aluminum products that constitute the raw material for the manufacture of finished goods ranging from automotive structures and body panels to food and beverage cans. There are two major types of manufacturing processes for aluminum rolled products differing mainly in the process used to achieve the initial stage of processing:
•hot mills — which require sheet ingot, a rectangular slab of aluminum, as starter material; and
•continuous casting mills — which can convert molten metal directly into semi-finished sheet.
Both processes require subsequent rolling, which we refer to as cold rolling, and finishing steps such as annealing, coating, leveling, or slitting to achieve the desired thickness, width and metal properties. Most customers receive shipments in the form of aluminum coil, a large roll of metal, which can be utilized in their fabrication processes.
Industry Sources of Metal
There are two sources of input material: (1) recycled aluminum, produced by remelting post-industrial and post-consumer scraps, and (2) primary aluminum, produced from alumina (extracted from bauxite), processed in a smelter.
Primary aluminum and sheet ingot can generally be purchased at prices set on the LME, plus a local market premium that varies by geographic region of delivery, alloying material, form (ingot or molten metal) and purity.
Recycled aluminum is generally purchased at a discount compared to the price of primary aluminum depending on type and quality of the scrap, geographic region, and other market factors. 
Industry End-use Markets
Aluminum rolled products companies produce and sell a wide range of products, which can be grouped into five end-use markets: (1) packaging, (2) transportation, (3) architectural, (4) industrial, and (5) consumer durables and other. Within each end-use market, aluminum rolled products are manufactured with a variety of alloy mixtures, including a range of tempers (hardness), gauges (thickness), and widths as well as various coatings and finishes. Large customers typically have customized needs that require close working relationships, including technical development and support with their supplying mills.
Aluminum has a wide variety of uses in end-use markets because of its lightweight characteristics, recyclability, and formability properties. The recyclability of aluminum enables it to be used, collected, melted, and returned to the original product form an unlimited number of times, unlike paper and polyethylene terephthalate plastic, which deteriorate with every iteration of recycling.
Packaging. Aluminum is used in beverage cans and bottles, food cans, beverage screw caps, and foil, among others. Packaging is the largest aluminum rolled products application, according to market data from Commodity Research Unit International Limited, an independent business analysis and consultancy group. Beverage cans are one of the largest aluminum rolled products applications. Aluminum remains the most sustainable packaging material for beverage brands. In addition to their recyclability, aluminum beverage cans offer advantages in fabricating efficiency and product shelf life. Fabricators are able to produce and fill beverage cans at very high speeds, and non-porous aluminum cans provide longer shelf life than glass or polyethylene terephthalate plastic containers. Additionally, the use of aluminum to package beverages such as craft beer is increasing, as aluminum blocks sunlight and therefore maintains the quality and taste of the product longer. Aluminum cans are light, stackable and use space efficiently, making them convenient and cost-efficient to ship.
Beverage can sheet is sold in coil form for the production of can bodies, ends, and tabs. The material can be ordered as rolled, degreased, pre-lubricated, pre-treated, and/or lacquered. Typically, can makers define their own specifications for material to be delivered in terms of alloy, gauge, width, and surface finish.
Foil wrap or packaging foil is another packaging application and it includes household and institutional aluminum foil. Container foil is used to produce semi-rigid containers such as pie plates and take-out food trays.
Transportation. Aluminum rolled products are used in vehicle structures (also known as "body-in-white") as well as automotive body panel applications, including hoods, doors, deck lids, fenders, and lift gates. Flat-rolled aluminum sheet is also used in the production of battery enclosures for the growing electric vehicle market. These uses typically result from cooperative efforts between aluminum rolled products manufacturers and their customers that yield solutions for specific requirements in alloy selection, fabrication procedure, surface quality and joining. There has been recent growth in certain geographic markets in passenger and commercial vehicle applications due to the lighter weight, better fuel economy and improved emissions performance associated with these applications. We expect increased growth in this end-use market driven by the increased adoption of electric vehicles, which use higher amounts of aluminum, as well as government regulations requiring improved emissions and better fuel economy for internal combustion engine vehicles, while also maintaining or improving vehicle performance and safety.
Heat exchangers, such as radiators, air conditioners, and auto fin material, are an important application for aluminum rolled products in the transportation end-use market. Original equipment manufacturers also use aluminum sheet, with specially treated surfaces and other specific properties, for interior and exterior applications. Newly developed alloys are being used in transportation tanks and rigid containers allowing for safer and more economical transportation of hazardous and corrosive materials.
Aluminum is also used in aerospace applications, as well as in the construction of ships' hulls, superstructures, and passenger rail cars because of its strength, light weight, formability, and corrosion resistance.
Architectural. Construction is the largest application within this end-use market. Aluminum rolled products developed for the construction industry are often decorative and non-flammable, offer insulating properties, are durable and corrosion resistant, and have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Aluminum siding, gutters, and downspouts comprise a significant amount of construction volume. Other applications include doors, windows, awnings, canopies, facades, roofs, and ceilings.
Industrial. Industrial applications include heat exchangers, process and electrical machinery, lighting fixtures, furniture, and insulation. 
Consumer Durables and Other. Aluminum's lightweight characteristics, high formability, ability to conduct electricity and dissipate heat and its corrosion resistance makes it useful in a wide variety of electronic applications. Uses of aluminum rolled products in electronics include flat screen televisions, personal computers, laptops, and mobile devices. Other uses of aluminum rolled products in consumer durables include microwaves, coffee makers, air conditioners, and cooking utensils.

The factors influencing competition vary by region and end-use market, but generally we compete on the basis of our value proposition, which includes price, product quality, the ability to meet customers' specifications, range of products offered, lead times, technical support, and customer service. In some end-use markets, competition is also affected by fabricators' requirements that suppliers complete a qualification process to supply their plants. This process can be rigorous and may take many months to complete. As a result, obtaining business from these customers can be a lengthy and expensive process. However, the ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications can represent a competitive advantage.
In addition to competition from others within the aluminum rolled products industry, we also face competition from non-aluminum material producers. In the packaging end-use market (primarily beverage and food cans), aluminum rolled products compete mainly with glass, polyethylene terephthalate plastic, and in some regions, steel. In the transportation end-use market, aluminum rolled products compete mainly with steel and composites. Aluminum competes with wood, plastic, cement, steel and other materials in building products applications. Aluminum competes with steel, copper, plastic, glass, and other materials in industrial applications. Additionally, aluminum rolled products compete mainly with plastic, steel, and magnesium in the consumer durables end-use market. Factors affecting competition with substitute materials include price, ease to manufacture, consumer preference and performance characteristics.
Key Factors Affecting Supply and Demand
The following factors have historically affected the supply of aluminum rolled products:
Production Capacity and Alternative Technology. The addition of rolling capacity requires large capital investments and significant plant construction or expansion, and typically requires long lead-time equipment orders. Advances in technological capabilities allow aluminum rolled products producers to better align product portfolios and supply with industry demand. There are lower cost ways to enter the industry such as continuous casting, which offers the ability to increase capacity in smaller increments than is possible with hot mill additions. However, the continuous casting process results in a more limited range of products.
Trade. Some trade flows occur between regions despite shipping costs, import duties, tariffs, and the lack of localized customer support. Higher value-added products are more likely to be traded internationally, especially if demand in certain markets exceeds local supply. With respect to less technically demanding applications, emerging markets with low cost inputs may export commodity aluminum rolled products to larger, more mature markets as we have seen with China.
The following factors have historically affected the demand for aluminum rolled products:
Economic Growth. We believe that economic growth is a significant driver of aluminum rolled products demand. In mature markets, growth in demand has typically correlated closely with industrial production growth. In many emerging markets, growth in demand typically exceeds industrial production growth largely because of expanding infrastructures, capital investments and rising incomes that often accompany economic growth in these markets.
Substitution Trends. Manufacturers' willingness to substitute other materials for aluminum in their products and competition from substitution materials suppliers also affect demand. There has been a strong substitution trend toward aluminum in the use of vehicles as automobile manufacturers look for ways to meet fuel efficiency regulations; improve performance; reduce carbon emissions in a cost-efficient manner; and lower vehicle weight, particularly in electric vehicles. As a result of aluminum's durability, strength and light weight, automobile manufacturers are substituting heavier alternatives, such as steel and iron, with aluminum. Carbon fiber and plastics are other lightweight material options, but their relatively high cost and limited end-of-life recyclability reduce their competitiveness as widespread material substitutes today. Consequently, demand for flat-rolled aluminum products has increased. We also see strong substitution trends toward aluminum in the beverage can market. With aluminum being the most sustainable packaging material for beverages, demand for infinitely recyclable aluminum remains strong. Package mix shift from other materials like glass, steel and polyethylene terephthalate into aluminum, and new beverage introductions – such as energy drinks, canned cocktails, spiked seltzer, and sparkling waters – all support demand levels.
Seasonality. During our third fiscal quarter, we typically experience seasonal slowdowns resulting in lower shipment volumes, although this has been less significant as our product portfolio shifts and diversifies. This is a result of declines in overall production output due primarily to holidays and cooler weather in North America and Europe, our two largest operating regions. We also experience downtime at our mills and customers' mills due to scheduled plant maintenance and are impacted to a lesser extent by the seasonal downturn in construction activity.
Sustainability. Growing awareness of environmentalism and demand for recyclable products has increased the demand for aluminum rolled products, particularly increased consumer preference for more sustainable beverage packaging options. Unlike other commonly recycled materials such as paper or polyethylene terephthalate plastic, aluminum can be infinitely recycled without affecting the quality of the product. Additionally, the recycling process uses approximately 95% less energy than is required to produce primary aluminum from mining and smelting, with an approximate equivalent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Our Business Strategy
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Market Data and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Novelis is driven by its purpose of shaping a sustainable world together. Our ambition is to be the world's leading provider of low-carbon, sustainable aluminum solutions that advance our business, industry, and society toward the benefits of a circular economy.

We continue to pursue a standardization of our manufacturing processes where possible, while still allowing the flexibility to respond to local market demands. 
Utilizing recycled material allows us to diversify our metal supply, helps control metal costs, and provides environmental benefits. We define recycled content as total aluminum rolled product shipments minus primary metal (net of metal loss) plus coated scrap and runaround melt loss. The percentage of recycled content within our aluminum rolled product shipments has increased from 33% to 57% from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2022. We work closely with our customers on innovation to drive more sustainable products for society. We are the only company of its size offering high-recycled content aluminum sheet for beverage and specialty product customers. We are also working closely with our automotive customers to redesign automotive alloys to be made with more recycled inputs, as well as purchasing the aluminum scrap resulting from our closed-loop recycling partnership with our automotive customers. 
Strengthen our Product Portfolio
We maintain a focus on capturing global growth in beverage can, automotive, aerospace, and specialty products markets. Our management approach helps us to systematically identify opportunities to improve the profitability of our operations through product portfolio analysis. This helps us target growth in attractive market segments, while also taking actions to exit or minimize participation in less attractive ones. We will continue to focus on these core product markets to drive profitability, while also aiming to broaden our customer base and explore new verticals and product markets that fit within our overall strategic vision, which is to lead the aluminum industry as the partner of choice for innovative solutions. 
Invest in Growth Opportunities
Over the past several years, we have invested in world-class assets and technical capabilities to meet increasing global demand for aluminum, particularly within the automotive market due to our continued focus on scaling our business model and growing alongside our customers. 
With strong markets, innovative products, solid customer partnerships, financial flexibility, and decades of manufacturing and recycling experience, we expect to see robust growth and organic investment opportunities for many years to come. We have identified more than $4.5 billion of organic growth capital spend opportunities over the next five years focused on increasing capacity and capabilities that meet growing customer demand and align with our sustainability commitments. We believe Novelis has the balance sheet strength and financial flexibility to invest in growth, while at the same time maintaining net debt leverage targets and shareholder and return commitments. We plan to continue to implement world class manufacturing initiatives and leverage digital technologies and other advancements in R&D and IT to unlock capacity, capture growth, and support sustainability initiatives. 
For a discussion of recent commitments and expenditures, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We are exploring additional rolling and recycling capacity investment opportunities in all regions with the goal of driving profitable volume growth in our core end markets, while maintaining a balanced and disciplined financial approach in our decision-making process.
Working Capital
We manage working capital based on cash needs as well as in an attempt to balance the timing of trade payables and receivables, including though factoring of trade receivables.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The input materials we use in manufacturing include primary aluminum, recycled aluminum, sheet ingot, alloying elements, and grain refiners. These raw materials are generally available from several sources and are not generally subject to supply constraints in normal market conditions. We also consume considerable amounts of energy in the operation of our facilities. For a discussion of current inflation and supply chain impacts on our materials, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Aluminum
We obtain aluminum from a number of sources, including the following:
Primary Aluminum Sourcing. We purchased or tolled approximately 1,625 kt of primary aluminum in fiscal 2022 in the form of sheet ingot, standard ingot, and molten metal.
Aluminum Products Recycling. We operate facilities in several plants to recycle post-consumer aluminum, such as UBCs collected through recycling programs. In addition, we have agreements with several of our large customers to have a closed-looped system whereby we take production scrap material from their fabricating activity and re-melt, cast, and roll it to re-supply these customers with aluminum sheet. Other sources of recycled material include lithographic plates and products with longer lifespans, like vehicles and buildings, which are starting to become high-volume sources of recycled material. We purchased or tolled approximately 2,214 kt of recycled content in fiscal 2022.
The overall benefit we receive from utilizing recycled metal is influenced by the overall price levels of the LME and local market premiums, the spread between the price for recycled aluminum and the LME primary aluminum price, and our consumption levels of the recycled material inputs. We have in the past and may continue to seek to stabilize our future exposure to metal prices through the use of derivative instruments.
Energy
We use several sources of energy in the manufacturing and delivery of our aluminum rolled products. In fiscal 2022, natural gas and electricity represented approximately 98% of our energy consumption by cost. We also use fuel oil and transport fuel. The majority of energy usage occurs at our casting centers and during the hot rolling process. Our cold rolling facilities require relatively less energy. We purchase our natural gas on the open market, which subjects us to market pricing fluctuations. We have in the past and may continue to seek to stabilize our future exposure to natural gas prices through the use of derivative instruments. A portion of our electricity requirements are purchased pursuant to long-term contracts in the local regions in which we operate. A number of our facilities are located in regions with regulated prices, which affords relatively stable costs. We have fixed pricing on some of our energy supply arrangements. 
Our Operating Segments
Due in part to the regional nature of supply and demand of aluminum rolled products and in order to best serve our customers, we manage our activities on the basis of geographical areas and are organized under four operating segments: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. Each segment manufactures aluminum sheet and light gauge products and recycles aluminum, while our Asia and Europe segments also produce aerospace and industrial plate.

Additional information related to our top customers is contained in Note 23 – Segment, Geographical Area, Major Customer and Major Supplier Information to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Distribution
We have two principal distribution channels for the end-use markets in which we operate: direct sales to our customers and sales to distributors.

 | Fiscal 2022 | | Fiscal 2021 | | Fiscal 2020
Direct sales as a percentage of total net sales | 96 | % | | 94 | % | 95 | %
Distributor sales as a percentage of total net sales | 4 | | | 6 | | 5 | 

Direct Sales
We supply various end-use markets all over the world through a direct sales force operating from individual facilities or sales offices, as well as from regional sales offices. The direct sales channel typically serves very large, sophisticated fabricators and original equipment manufacturers. Longstanding relationships are maintained with leading companies in industries using aluminum rolled products. Supply contracts for large global customers generally range from one to five years in length and historically there has been a high degree of renewal business with these customers. Certain customers require suppliers to complete a lengthy and expensive qualification process. The ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications can represent a competitive advantage. Given the customized nature of products and in some cases, large order sizes, switching costs are significant, thus adding to the overall consistency of the customer base.
We also use third-party agents or traders in some regions to complement our own sales force. These agents provide service to our customers in countries where we do not have local expertise.
Distributors
We also sell our products through third-party aluminum distributors. Customers of distributors are widely dispersed, and sales through this channel are highly fragmented. Distributors sell mostly commodity or less specialized products into many end-use markets in small quantities, including the architectural and industrial markets. We collaborate with our distributors to develop new end-use products and improve the supply chain and order efficiencies.

We are focused on a safety as a key priority. Guiding us in this direction is our Novelis Safety System, which provides us with a systematic approach to identifying, managing, and mitigating risks in our operations. In addition, we ask all Novelis employees to look out for their own safety, as well as that of their colleagues, by following three basic safety obligations: (1) I will work safe, (2) I will intervene if I see somebody working unsafe, and (3) I will stop any unsafe behavior if intervened upon.
Talent Development
At Novelis, we make it a priority to identify and nurture talent. We are proud of programs, such as:
•Global Accelerated Leadership Program – Designed to develop talent for possible future leadership roles. 
•Global Technical Training – High-impact technical training topics, relevant for entry-level or mid-career technical employees. 
•Engineering Development Program – Technical talent pipeline enhancer that exposes participants to leaders from across the organization and includes courses on a wide-variety of technical and business subjects. 
Compensation and Benefits Programs
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain, and engage a talented workforce. We believe our programs are competitive with our peers and emphasize performance-based compensation to align employee rewards with company performance. Benefits are a key component of our total rewards package. We offer a holistic benefits package designed to provide greater security for our employees and their families through healthcare, life insurance, paid parental leave, disability benefits, savings and retirement, and various other welfare benefit programs generally available to all active full-time employees through plans we sponsor or through social programs in the countries where we operate. We regularly conduct market pay equity assessments and compensation reviews, and we continue to actively work to reduce unconscious bias in our sourcing, hiring practices, performance reviews, and promotion opportunities that may contribute to pay inequities.
Employee Relations
We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. A substantial portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and their employment conditions are governed by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements are negotiated on a site, regional, or national level and are of varying durations. 
Intellectual Property
We actively review intellectual property arising from our operations and our R&D activities, and, when appropriate, we apply for patents in appropriate jurisdictions. We currently hold approximately 3,146 patents and patent applications on approximately 392 different items of intellectual property. While these patents and patent applications are important to our business on an aggregate basis, no single patent or patent application is deemed to be material to our business.
We have applied or received registrations for the "Novelis" word trademark and the Novelis logo trademark in approximately 55 countries where we have significant sales or operations. Novelis uses the Aditya Birla logo under license from Aditya Birla Management Corporation Private Limited.
We have also registered the word "Novelis" and several derivations thereof as domain names in numerous top-level domains around the world to protect our presence on the world wide web.
Environment, Health and Safety
As a purpose-driven company, Novelis strives to protect and preserve the environment and the health, safety, and well-being of our colleagues, customers, and communities. During fiscal 2022, we recycled over 82 billion used beverage cans, and recycled content made up 57% of total input in our aluminum rolled product. We define recycled content as total aluminum rolled product shipments minus primary metal (net of metal loss) plus coated scrap and runaround melt loss. The recycled content rate of 57% in fiscal 2022 is a reduction from the 61% reported in fiscal 2021 largely due to reduced scrap inputs impacted by supply chain disruption and logistical challenges. With our plant operations around the globe, we continue to focus on reducing carbon emissions, limiting water consumption, and lowering electricity usage while targeting year-over-year improvements in overall production. During fiscal 2022, 14 facilities achieved major safety milestones by operating 365 consecutive days without a recordable injury.
Our global operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations from various jurisdictions, which govern, among other things, air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; the remediation of contaminated sites and restoration of natural resources; carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions; and employee health and safety. Future environmental, health and safety regulations may impose stricter compliance requirements on the industries in which we operate. Additional equipment or process changes at some of our facilities, and related capital expenditures, which may be material, may be needed to meet existing or future requirements. The cost of meeting these requirements may be significant. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to administrative, civil, or criminal penalties; obligations to pay damages or other costs; and injunctions and other orders, including orders to cease operations.
We are involved in proceedings under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or Superfund, or analogous state provisions regarding our liability arising from the usage, storage, treatment, or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes at a number of sites in the U.S., as well as similar proceedings under the laws and regulations of the other jurisdictions in which we have operations, including Brazil, certain countries in the European Union, and South Korea. Many of these jurisdictions have laws that impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the costs of environmental, health and safety remediation, natural resource damages, third-party claims, and other expenses. In addition, we are, from time to time, subject to environmental, health and safety reviews and investigations by relevant governmental authorities.
We have established procedures for regularly evaluating environmental, health and safety loss contingencies, including those arising from environmental, health and safety reviews and investigations and any other environmental, health and safety remediation or compliance matters. Where appropriate, we have established liabilities based on our estimates for the currently anticipated costs that are deemed probable associated with these environmental, health and safety matters.
Our expenditures for environmental, health and safety protection (including estimated and probable environmental, health and safety remediation costs as well as general environmental, health and safety protection costs at our facilities) and the betterment of working conditions in our facilities were $18 million during fiscal 2022, of which $16 million was expensed and $2 million was capitalized. We expect that these expenditures will be approximately $20 million in fiscal 2023, of which we estimate $13 million will be expensed and $7 million will be capitalized.
We are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenditures to meet our health and safety compliance requirements, as well as to improve our safety systems.
