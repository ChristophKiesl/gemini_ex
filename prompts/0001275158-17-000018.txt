ITEM 1.    Business
General
Noodles & Company is a restaurant concept offering lunch and dinner within the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry. We opened our first location in Denver, Colorado in 1995, offering noodle and pasta dishes, staples of many cuisines, with the goal of delivering fresh ingredients and flavors from around the world under one roof. Today, our globally inspired menu includes a wide variety of high quality, cooked-to-order dishes, including noodles and pasta, soups, salads and appetizers, which are served on china by our friendly team members. We believe that we offer our customers value, with per person spend of $8.68 for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2017.
We offer approximately 19 globally inspired dishes together on a single menu. We believe we will benefit from trends in consumer preferences, wider availability of international cuisines and increasingly adventurous consumer tastes. At many restaurants, customers are limited to a particular ethnic cuisine or type of dish, such as a sandwich, burrito or burger. At Noodles & Company, we aim to eliminate the “veto vote” by satisfying the preferences of a wide range of customers, whether a family or parent with kids, a group of coworkers, an individual or a large party.
We believe that our globally inspired menu, focused on noodle and pasta dishes, differentiates us from other restaurants. We believe our attributes—global flavors, variety, dishes prepared-to-order and fast service—allow us to compete against multiple segments throughout the restaurant industry and provide us a larger addressable market for lunch and dinner than competitors who focus on a single cuisine. We believe we provide a pleasant dining experience by quickly delivering fresh food with friendly service at a price point we believe is attractive to our customers.
Noodles & Company is a Delaware corporation that was organized in 2002. Noodles & Company and its subsidiaries are sometimes referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” in this report. We refer to our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, as our “Class A common stock,” unless the context otherwise requires. We refer to our Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, as our “Class B common stock,” unless the context otherwise requires. We refer to our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock together as our “common stock.” The rights of the holders of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except that our Class B common stock does not vote on the election or removal of directors unless and until converted on a share for share basis into Class A common stock.
Our Concept and Business Strengths
Variety. We have purposefully chosen a range of healthy to indulgent dishes to satisfy carnivores and vegetarians. Our menu encourages customers to customize their meals to meet their tastes and nutritional preferences with our selection of 14 fresh vegetables and six proteins–marinated steak, naturally raised pork, chicken, meatballs, shrimp and organic tofu. 
All of our dishes are cooked-to-order with fresh, high quality ingredients sourced from our carefully selected suppliers. Our commitment to the freshness of our ingredients is further demonstrated by our use of seasonal ingredients and healthy add-in options (such as organic tofu). Our culinary team strives to develop new dishes and limited time offerings to further reinforce our World Kitchen brand positioning and regularly provide our customers additional options. For example, during 2016 we offered as new dishes or limited time offerings items such as Korean Beef Noodles and Buffalo Mac & Cheese. This focus on culinary innovation allows us to prepare and serve high quality food.
Value. The value we offer, the quality of our food and the welcoming ambiance of our restaurants creates an overall customer experience that we believe is unique and differentiated. Our per person spend is competitive not only within the fast casual segment, but also within the quick-service segment. We deliver value by combining a family-friendly dining environment with the opportunity to enjoy many dishes containing a variety of fresh ingredients. We also offer Kids Meals which, at a fixed low price, offer the opportunity for parents to feed their children a balanced meal with sides such as broccoli, carrots, fruit, applesauce and a smaller portion of our housemade rice crispy treat.
Our Restaurant Experience. We design each location individually, which we believe creates an inviting restaurant environment. We believe the ambiance is warm and welcoming, with muted lighting and colors, comfortable seating and our own custom music mix, which is intended to make our customers feel relaxed and at home.

We believe we deliver an exceptional overall dining experience. We believe that our customers should expect not only great food from our restaurants, but also warm hospitality and attentive service. Whether you are a parent with kids or a businessperson with a laptop, you simply order your food, grab a drink and take a seat. We cook each dish to order in approximately five minutes and bring the food right to your table. Our customers may enjoy a relaxed meal or just eat and run. 
Consistent with our culture of enhanced customer service, we seek to hire individuals who will deliver prompt, attentive service by engaging customers the moment they enter our restaurants. Our training philosophy empowers both our restaurant managers and team members to add a personal touch when serving our customers, such as coming out from behind the counter to explain our menu and guide customers to the right dish. Our restaurant managers are critical to our success, as we believe that their entrepreneurial spirit and outreach efforts build our brand in our communities. We call our cashiers “Noodle Ambassadors” to highlight their role in helping our customers explore our global menu. After our customers order at the counter, their food is served on china and delivered to their table by our friendly team members. 
Our Operational Strategy
We believe our brand and globally inspired menu resonates with consumers, and we believe our restaurants and team members provide customers a unique and high-quality experience. We are focused on offering customers flavorful, cooked-to-order dishes in a warm and welcoming environment at an attractive value. However, our business has recently underperformed our expectations and our concept’s potential primarily due to the performance of a group of our restaurants opened in the last two to three years. We believe that our rapid expansion, particularly into new markets, without commensurate investments in training and support of our team members, adversely affected these restaurants’ performance. 
In order to improve our profitability and earnings, as well as deliver an exceptional dining experience, we believe we need to enhance our menu offerings, improve our operational consistency and efficiency and close a select group of restaurants. To execute against these goals, we have developed a strategy, outlined herein, to reposition the business and enhance our financial performance.
We believe we have made significant progress with respect to the strategic initiatives that we have pursued over the past six months. In August 2016, we completed an organizational restructuring that we expect to generate approximately $2.5 million of annual cash savings. In the period from August 2016 through January 2017, during which time we began pursuing a number of customer-facing as well as operational initiatives, our Service Management Group overall guest satisfaction scores increased from 66.0% to 71.0%, the highest score that we have achieved in our history. Additionally, we have begun to focus resources on in-restaurant support and training, which we believe will reduce manager turnover.
Restaurant initiatives. We are pursuing strategies to improve the operational and financial performance of our restaurant base. Our plan to improve our performance includes the following three key strategies:

• | Focusing on our global flavors and menu offering. We believe that our globally inspired menu, focused on noodle and pasta dishes, differentiates us from other restaurants. We also believe this global variety, which includes a range of healthy to indulgent dishes that are cooked to order with fresh, high-quality ingredients, remains a competitive strength. However, we believe we can elevate our offerings by improving the flavor and taste profiles of existing menu items and introducing new menu items from global cuisines, including those cuisines that have not historically been represented in the Mediterranean, Asian and American menu categories we have offered. In two markets we are testing menus that include several new dishes, a reformulation of most of our existing dishes and the elimination of a number of dishes that were a small part of our menu revenue mix. We intend to roll out successful elements of these tests nationally in 2017 and 2018. In February 2017, we launched two limited-time offers, Adobo with Pork or Chicken and Thai Green Curry, both of which are new dishes with distinctive flavor profiles.


• | Improving labor efficiencies and unit-level margins. We believe that there is significant opportunity to improve our operational consistency as well as our overall unit level margins. In October 2016, we reduced the size of our core menu from 28 entrée items to 19 entrée items, removing menu items that did not sell well and were challenging for our teams to execute. We have also initiated tests of equipment such as a chopper and steamer, which we believe will save labor hours as well as improve throughput in our restaurants. Finally, we have begun testing self-bussing stations in certain test markets, which we believe will reduce labor hours and improve cleanliness in our restaurants. While we believe the strategies mentioned above will meaningfully improve our labor efficiencies, we are also pursuing a strategy for a redesign of our kitchen and dining room, which we believe will allow us to develop a more cost-effective and efficient production and service model.

2



• | Increasing convenience for our customers. We believe there is significant opportunity in increasing convenience for our customers. We are currently testing a revised menu layout that we believe will make it easier for our customers to use our menu as well as increase customer check average. Finally, we have begun testing a more streamlined approach to the pick-up of online orders through dedicated take-out areas, which we believe will better meet the increased convenience demanded by today’s consumers.


• | Improved manager selection, training and development of our teams. We have increased the focus on the selection, training and development of our restaurant teams. We are initiating the use of new assessment tools in management hiring, and we have effected certain changes to our restaurant compensation program to encourage team member retention. We have also begun rolling out new training tools and learning management systems to improve execution and encourage career development with our teams. Finally, we are implementing new selection methods that we believe will improve the caliber of our promotions and new hires at all levels.

Restaurant Portfolio and Franchising
We have significantly grown our restaurant unit base over the past several years. As of January 3, 2017, we had 457 company-owned restaurants and 75 franchise restaurants in 35 states, the District of Columbia and one Canadian province. Our restaurants are typically 2,600 to 2,700 square feet and are located in end-cap, in-line or free-standing locations across a variety of urban and suburban markets. During the near-term we anticipate modest unit growth combined with targeted restaurant closures and refranchising, each as described in greater detail below, as we allow time for our operational, financial, and customer initiatives to become effective. 
As of January 3, 2017, we had 75 franchise units in 16 states operated by 12 franchisees. We look for experienced, well-capitalized franchise partners who are able to leverage their existing infrastructure and local knowledge in a manner that benefits both our franchisees and ourselves. As of January 3, 2017, a total of`11 area developers have signed development agreements providing for the opening of 124 additional restaurants in their respective territories. We expect to continue to offer development rights in markets where we do not intend to build company-owned restaurants. We may offer such rights to larger developers who commit to open 10 or more units, or to smaller developers who may commit to open significantly fewer restaurants. We do not currently intend to offer single-unit franchises. We believe the strength and attractiveness of our brand will attract experienced and well-capitalized area developers.
In addition, to support our portfolio of company-owned and franchise restaurants, we recently announced strategies to close underperforming restaurants, reduce restaurant growth and refranchise restaurants in certain of our markets.

• | Restaurant closings. Our financial performance has been adversely impacted by a subset of our restaurants that have significantly underperformed our restaurant averages, as measured by average unit volumes (“AUVs”), restaurant contribution margin and cash flow. Many of these restaurants were opened in the last two to three years in newer markets where brand awareness of our restaurants is not as strong and where it has been more difficult to adequately staff our restaurants. Our Board of Directors has approved the closure of certain of these restaurants in order to eliminate the negative cash flow resulting from their continued operation and to permit us to increase our focus on the remaining restaurants in our restaurant portfolio. We believe closing these restaurants will increase our restaurant contribution, restaurant contribution margin, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”), adjusted EBITDA margin and net income. For more information on these financial metrics, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Key Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance.”

We have closed 39 restaurants in the first quarter of 2017 and intend to close an additional 18 restaurants prior to the end of the second quarter of 2017. These 57 restaurants have significantly underperformed our restaurant averages, generating AUVs of approximately $0.7 million and an aggregate restaurant contribution margin of approximately (22.0%) during the fiscal year ended January 3, 2017. If such restaurants had not been in operation during such period, we believe that our restaurant contribution would have been $8.2 million higher and restaurant contribution margin would have been 290 basis points higher.
Our anticipated plan of restaurant closings will result in liabilities to landlords from the termination of our leases for such restaurants, fees to be paid to our real estate advisor and brokers related to such terminations and other costs of closing restaurants, such as severance for terminated employees (“Restaurant Closing Liabilities”). We currently anticipate that the Restaurant Closing Liabilities future cash outlays will total $24.0 million to $29.0 million, which will include (i) $23.0 million to $28.0 million relating to the termination of leases, including related fees and expenses, to be paid out over the 
3


next 12 to 18 months, and (ii) approximately $1.0 million relating to severance for terminated employees. However, it is possible that the Restaurant Closing Liabilities will exceed such amounts. We expect to recognize accounting charges for the Restaurant Closing Liabilities aggregating between $17.5 million to $19.5 million, at the time such restaurants are closed, subject to adjustment as lease terminations occur. 

• | Reduction in corporate restaurant growth. In 2016, we announced that we intended to reduce our rate of company-owned restaurant unit growth. In 2016, we opened 38 company-owned restaurants and in 2017, we plan to open between 12 and 15 company-owned restaurants; eight of these openings have occurred to date in the first quarter of 2017. We do not intend to open restaurants in new markets in 2017, and most of our openings will be in well-established markets where we maintain strong brand awareness and restaurant-level financial performance that exceeds company averages. We believe this more moderate growth strategy will enhance our ability to focus on improving restaurant operations and profitability. We will continue to evaluate our company-owned restaurant growth rate based on our operational and financial performance, capital resources and real estate opportunities.


• | Refranchising. We have identified a number of restaurants within certain markets for potential sale or refranchising to new or existing franchisees. In general, these restaurants are in markets that are less penetrated than our well-established markets and provide significant opportunity for unit growth. Given our decision to moderate our company-owned restaurant growth rate, we believe that franchise operators will better support the development of the Noodles & Company brand in these markets. In connection with the sale of company-owned restaurants to new or existing franchisees in existing markets, we intend to enter into agreements that also provide for the development of new restaurants. After refranchising select company-owned restaurants, and as we grow with existing and new franchisees into the future, we expect franchise restaurants to represent a larger percentage of Noodles & Company system-wide restaurants than they currently constitute. The franchisor model requires significantly lower capital investment by the franchisor and generates revenues, in the form of development and franchise fees and royalties, which are less volatile than company-owned restaurant revenues. While we plan to embark on refranchising in 2017, we are focused on identifying qualified franchisees, and it may take multiple years to complete this effort.

Site Development and Expansion
We consider our site selection and development process critical to our long-term success. We use a combination of our own development team and outside real estate consultants to locate, evaluate and negotiate new sites using various criteria. In addition, because we offer a mix of dishes and a dining experience that differ from many other restaurant concepts, we believe our restaurants are highly sought after by real estate owners and developers. Also, we occasionally learn of opportunities early in their development process, allowing us to secure optimal locations in those instances.
In making site selection decisions, we also use several analytical tools designed to uncover the key site, demographic, business, retail, competitive and traffic characteristics that drive successful locations. These tools have been customized to leverage existing real estate information to project sales at a potential location and to assist in the development of local marketing plans.
Once a location has been approved by our executive-level selection committee, we begin a design process to match the characteristics and feel of the location to the trade area. For example, in a trade area with a high percentage of families we will utilize additional booth seating in the dining room, and in an urban location we will typically alter our kitchen design to enhance throughput for the busy lunch hours.
Our Executive Management Team
In 2016, Kevin Reddy, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Phil Petrilli, Executive Vice President of Operations, each left the Company. In July 2016, Dave Boennighausen, our Chief Financial Officer, became interim Chief Executive Officer and we hired Victor Heutz as Chief Operations Oficer. Our Board of Directors is conducting a search to find a permanent Chief Executive Officer. Candidates include both our interim Chief Executive Officer and external candidates. The existing management team is actively managing the business in accordance with a business strategy approved by our Board of Directors.

Restaurant Management and Operations
Friendly People. We believe our genuine, friendly people separate us from our competitors. We value the individuality of our team members, which we believe results in a management, operations and training philosophy distinct from that of our competitors. We make an effort to hire team members who share a passion for food, have a competitive spirit and will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards. We seek to hire individuals who will deliver prompt, attentive service by engaging customers the moment they enter our restaurants. We empower our team members to enrich the experience of our customers and directly address any concerns that may arise in a manner that contributes to the success of our business.
Restaurant Management and Employees. Each restaurant typically has a restaurant manager, an assistant manager and as many as 15 to 25 team members. We cross-train our employees in an effort to create a depth of competency in our critical restaurant functions. Consistent with our emphasis on customer interaction, we encourage our restaurant managers and team members to welcome and interact with customers throughout their visit. To lead our restaurant management teams, we have area managers (each of whom is responsible for between five and 12 restaurants), as well as market directors (each of whom is responsible for between 50 and 80 restaurants).
Training and Career Development. We believe that our training efforts create a culture of continuous learning and professional growth that allows our team members to continue their career development with us. Within each restaurant, two to four team members are designated to lead the training efforts and ensure a consistent approach to team member development. We produce training materials that encourage individual contributions and participation from our team members, rather than providing rote, step-by-step scripts or rigid and extensively detailed policy manuals.
Food Preparation and Quality. Our teams use classic professional cooking methods, including hand-chopping, par boiling and sautéing many of our vegetables, in full kitchens resembling those of full service restaurants. All team members, including our restaurant managers, spend their first several days working solely with food and learning these techniques, and we spend a significant amount of time ensuring that each team member learns how to prepare and cook our food properly. Despite our more labor-intensive method of food preparation, we believe that we produce food with an efficiency that enables us to compete effectively.
The majority of our restaurants have exhibition-style kitchens. This design demonstrates our commitment to cooking fresh food in an accessible manner. We provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way.
All of our dishes are cooked to order at food safe temperatures or, in the case of salads, subject to our produce washing protocols, which helps us to ensure that the food that we serve to our customers is safe. We have designed our food safety and quality assurance programs to maintain high standards for our food and food preparation procedures. Our quality assurance manager oversees comprehensive restaurant and supplier audits based upon the potential food safety risk of each food. We also consider food safety and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers. Our suppliers are inspected by federal, state and local regulators or other reputable, qualified inspection services, which helps ensure their compliance with all federal food safety and quality guidelines. We regularly inspect our suppliers to ensure that the ingredients we buy conform to our quality standards and that the prices we pay are competitive. We also rely on our own recipes, specifications and protocols to ensure that our food is consistently the best quality that is possible when it is served, including a physical examination of ingredients when they arrive at our restaurants. We train our employees to pay detailed attention to food quality at every stage of the food preparation cycle, and we have developed a daily checklist that our employees use to assess the freshness and quality of food supplies. Finally, we encourage our customers to provide feedback regarding our food quality so that we can identify and resolve problems or concerns as quickly as possible. 
Restaurant Marketing
Our marketing efforts seek to increase sales through a variety of channels and initiatives. Community-based restaurant marketing, as well as online, social and other media tools, highlight our competitive strengths, including our varied and healthy menu offerings and the value we offer our customers.

• | Outdoor, Radio, and Digital Advertising. In select markets where we have economies of scale, we utilize traditional advertising methods such as outdoor billboards and transit stations, as well as radio placement. Additionally, we use targeted digital advertising in many of our markets. We believe these efforts help to increase top of mind awareness with potential customers and drive both frequency and trial. In addition, digital advertising provides us with the opportunity to promote specific product platforms and offerings such as online ordering.

• | Our Menu Offerings. We focus some of our marketing efforts on new menu offerings to broaden our appeal to our customers. We promote these items through a variety of formats including market-wide public relations events, social media marketing, radio promotions, tastings and email blasts to our e-club. In addition to increasing brand awareness, these promotions also encourage prompt consumer action, resulting in more immediate increases in our customer traffic.


• | Online, Social and Other Media Tools. We rely on our website, www.noodles.com, to promote our business and increase brand awareness. The information on or available through our website is not, and should not be considered, a part of this report. Our customers are encouraged to sign up to receive email communication or Noodlegrams, updating them on new menu offerings and promotional opportunities. As of January 3, 2017, more than 1,600,000 of our customers have signed up to receive Noodlegrams. We also communicate with our customers using social media, such as our Facebook and Instagram pages, our YouTube and Vimeo channels and our Twitter feed. Our media tools also include advertising and direct mail in local, regional and national print/online media and mass communications including radio and out of home. In October 2016, we also began the testing of our NoodlesRewards loyalty program, which we believe will allow us a significant opportunity to create deeper relationships with our guests and increase frequency and average spend. Our online and social media engagement provide exciting opportunities to engage with our customers; however, such efforts also entail certain risks.


• | Creating New Meal Occasions. We also focus on ways Noodles & Company can serve customers at different times and in new places. For example, our Kids Meal menu was created for the future foodies of the world, children aged ten and under are invited to design their own meal made fresh-to-order, with quality ingredients, by choosing their entrée, two sides and a drink for around $5. Customers who want to feed a large group can enjoy our catering options comprised of main entrées, sides and desserts. We market these offerings in a variety of ways, including through in-restaurant posters, email Noodlegrams, Facebook posts and other communications outside of our restaurants. 


• | Making Noodles & Company Easier to Use. Some of our marketing efforts focus on making our restaurants easier to use. We seek to deliver superior customer service at every opportunity, generating consumer awareness of menu offerings with in-restaurant communications such as displays of our menu offerings that are visible upon entry and table top cards that highlight healthy food offerings. By providing multiple points of access to our wide variety of menu offerings, we seek to optimize our customers’ in-restaurant experience to increase the frequency of our customers’ visits. Our efforts also utilize tools like online ordering.

Suppliers
Maintaining a high degree of quality in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We carefully select suppliers based on quality and their understanding of our brand, and we seek to develop mutually beneficial long-term relationships with them. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward, fixed and formula pricing protocols. We have tried to increase, in some cases, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we monitor industry news, trade issues, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices. In addition, a substantial volume of our produce items are grown in Mexico and other countries and any new or increased import duties, tariffs or taxes, or other changes in U.S. trade or tax policy, could result in higher food and supply costs. 
Seasonality
Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced winter and holiday traffic and higher in the second and third quarters. 
Competition
We face competition from the casual dining, quick-service and fast casual segments of the restaurant industry. These segments are highly competitive with respect to taste, price, food quality and presentation, service, location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant, among other things. Our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains who offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. Many of our competitors have existed longer and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. Among our competitors are a number of multi-unit, multi-market fast casual restaurant concepts, some of which are expanding nationally. As we expand, we will face competition from these concepts and new competitors that strive to compete with our market segments.

Intellectual Property and Trademarks
We own a number of trademarks and service marks registered or pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). We have registered the following marks with the PTO: Noodles & Company, the Noodles & Company logo, Your World Kitchen, Noodles & Company World Kitchen, Noodlegram and Wisconsin Mac & Cheese. We also have certain trademarks registered or pending in certain foreign countries. In addition, we have registered the Internet domain name www.noodles.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this report. We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to the marketing of our brand, and it is our policy to protect and defend vigorously our rights to such intellectual property.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to public and occupational health and safety, sanitation and fire prevention. We operate each of our restaurants in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations. However, an inability to obtain or retain health department or other licenses could adversely affect our operations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular restaurant or group of restaurants.
In addition, in order to develop and construct restaurants, we need to comply with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date, but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new restaurants. We are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such actions will not require us to expend substantial funds.
In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other federal and state laws governing similar matters including minimum wages, overtime, workplace safety and other working conditions. Our failure to fully comply with these laws could subject us to potential litigation and liability. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to our current and any future franchise operations.
We are also subject to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”), which requires health care coverage for many previously uninsured individuals and expands coverage for those already insured. We began offering such benefits in July 2015, and as a consequence we are incurring additional expenses for employee health care. It is possible that legislation will be passed by Congress and signed into law that repeals the PPACA, in whole or in part, and/or introduces a new form of health care reform. It is unclear at this point what the scope of any such legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding possible replacement health care reform legislation, we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the Company’s health care expenditures may increase. 
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances (“environmental laws”). These environmental laws can provide for significant fines and penalties for non-compliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. We are not aware of any environmental laws that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures relating to our restaurants. However, we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered, interpreted or enforced, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims relating to, environmental laws. It is possible that we will become subject to environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Management Information Systems
We use a variety of applications and systems to securely manage the flow of information within each restaurant, and within our central support office infrastructure. All of our restaurants use computerized management information systems, which we believe are scalable to support any future growth plans. We use point-of-sale (“POS”) computers designed specifically for the restaurant industry. Our POS system provides a touch screen interface, a graphical order confirmation display and integrated, high-speed credit card and gift card processing. Our online ordering system allows guests to place orders online or through our mobile app. Orders taken remotely are routed to the point-of-sales system based on the time of customer order pickup. The POS system is used to collect daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales, product mix and average check that we actively analyze. All products sold and prices at our company-owned restaurants are programmed into the system from our central support office. We also continue to modernize and make investments in our information technology networks and infrastructure, specifically in our physical and technological security measures to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent breaches, such as the data security incident we experienced in 2016 (described below), and to provide improved control, security and scalability. Enhancing the security of our financial data, customer information and other personal information is a high priority for us. 
Our in-restaurant back office computer system is designed to assist in the management of our restaurants and provide labor and food cost management tools. These tools provide restaurant operations management and our central support office quick access to detailed business data and reduces restaurant managers’ administrative time. The system provides our restaurant managers the ability to submit orders electronically with our distribution network. The system also supplies sales, bank deposit and variance data to our accounting department on a daily basis. We use this data to generate daily sales information and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures, as well as preliminary weekly detailed profit and loss statements for each location with final reports following the end of each period.
Franchisees use similar point of sale systems and are required to report sales on a daily basis through an on-line reporting network and submit their restaurant-level financial statements on a quarterly or annual basis.
Data Breach Liabilities
On June 28, 2016, we announced that a data security incident compromised the security of the payment information of some customers who used debit or credit cards at certain Noodles & Company locations between January 31, 2016 and June 2, 2016. The malware involved in the incident has been removed, and we believe that it no longer poses a risk to credit or debit cards currently being used at affected locations. We have been implementing additional security procedures to further secure customers’ debit and credit card information. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Recent Trends, Risks and Uncertainties—Data Breach Liabilities” for more information.
Recent Financing Transactions
In order to pursue our operational strategies and fund future obligations such as the Restaurant Closing Liabilities and the Data Breach Liabilities, we determined that we needed additional sources of liquidity. We have executed the following transactions in order to provide us with additional liquidity:

• | Private placement. On February 9, 2017, we completed a private placement transaction for aggregate gross proceeds to us of $18.5 million. For more information, see “Private placement” below.


• | Credit agreement amendment. Concurrent with the private placement, we also amended our credit agreement to increase our flexibility under the credit facility.

Private placement. On February 8, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Catterton-Noodles, LLC (“L Catterton”), pursuant to which we agreed, in return for aggregate gross proceeds to us of $18.5 million, to sell to L Catterton an aggregate of 18,500 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, convertible into 4,252,873 shares of Class A common stock (the “preferred stock”), at a purchase price of $1,000 per share, plus warrants (the “warrants”) exercisable for five years beginning six months following their issuance for the purchase of 1,913,793 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price per share of $4.35, which is equal to the closing bid price of our Class A common stock on February 7, 2017 (such transactions, collectively, the “private placement”). The preferred stock will rank senior to any other class or series of our equity, including our common stock. The preferred stock will be entitled to a priority cash payment in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. The funding of the private placement occurred on February 9, 2017.

Each share of preferred stock is initially convertible at the holder’s option, subject to certain terms and conditions, at a conversion price of $4.35 per share, which is equal to the closing bid price for our Class A common stock on February 7, 2017 and is subject to adjustment for dividends, certain distributions, stock splits, combinations, reclassifications, recapitalizations and similar events. The preferred stock will accrue dividends beginning on the earlier of (i) the six-month anniversary of our issuing the preferred stock and (ii) the date on which we complete specified equity offerings generating aggregate gross proceeds to us of at least $50.0 million. If we complete specified equity offerings generating aggregate gross proceeds to us of at least $50.0 million (including proceeds from the private placement) prior to the six-month anniversary of our issuing the preferred stock, then (i) if the volume-weighted average price per share of our Class A common stock for the prior 30-day period is greater than the conversion price, we may elect, and we currently intend, to convert the preferred stock into Class A common stock at the then-applicable conversion price, or (ii) if the volume-weighted average price per share of our Class A common stock for the prior 30-day period is equal to or less than the conversion price, dividends on the preferred stock will stop accruing. In addition, the preferred stock are also entitled to participate in cash and in-kind distributions to holders of shares of our common stock on an as-converted basis. The dividend rate of the preferred stock is 8.0% per annum and will increase by 0.5% per month beginning on the date that is the six-month anniversary of our issuing the preferred stock, up to a maximum of 18.0% per annum. Dividends on the preferred stock will be payable only in cash, when, as, and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of legally available funds and if, after such payment, we would be in compliance with the covenants under our outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money. Additionally, holders of the preferred stock enjoy customary equity participation rights, voting rights on an as-converted basis, customary anti-dilution provisions, customary information rights and registration rights with related monetary penalties. The specific rights of holders of the preferred stock are set forth in a Certificate of Designations attached as Exhibit 4.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 9, 2017. Additionally, the form of the warrant and the Securities Purchase Agreement were each attached as Exhibit 4.2 and 10.1, respectively, to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 9, 2017.
In connection with the private placement, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with Argentia Private Investments Inc. (“Argentia”), that provides we will indemnify Argentia in limited circumstances for losses incurred by Argentia or its affiliates that arise out of the private placement, for which transaction Argentia provided its consent pursuant to the terms of our stockholders agreement. For more information see “Transactions with Related Persons” below.
Credit agreement amendment. On February 8, 2017, we amended our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2013, by entering into Amendment No. 5 to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as borrower, with the guarantors signatory thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders signatory thereto (the “Amendment”). The Amendment modifies some of the changes made to our credit agreement in the previously disclosed Amendment No. 4, dated as of November 4, 2016. Among other things, the Amendment (i) restores our ability to request an increase in the maximum commitment amount under the credit facility by up to $15.0 million, (ii) suspends quarterly amortization payments of $2.5 million until the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2018, (iii) increases the interest rate margin applicable at total lease adjusted leverage levels at and above 4.25:1.00 and from the period of the date of the Amendment to the delivery of the first following quarterly compliance certificate, and (iv) makes certain other changes. The Consolidated EBITDA definition, as revised, will permit certain costs to be added back into the Consolidated EBITDA calculation, including the costs associated with the Restaurant Closing Liabilities and the Data Breach Liabilities. In addition, the Amendment provides that upon the completion of one or more equity issuances for an aggregate gross purchase amount of at least $45.0 million (including the $18.5 million of preferred stock and warrants issued to L Catterton pursuant to the private placement), (i) the required $2.5 million quarterly amortization payment will be eliminated and (ii) increased capital expenditure amounts related to restaurant growth will be permitted. The Amendment also revises certain financial covenant levels. The Amendment was attached as Exhibit 10.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 9, 2017.
In addition to the private placement and the amendment to our credit facility, we intend to take further measures to address our capital needs and anticipate making further announcements in this respect in the future. Specifically, on February 9, 2017, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with respect to our Class A common stock.
