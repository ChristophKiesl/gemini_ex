Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We are an owner and operator of franchised and franchisable businesses that continually looks to grow our portfolio of brands while utilizing our operating and capital allocation philosophies to generate strong cash flows. We have a diversified and growing portfolio of highly recognized brands. Our asset-light business model is designed to generate consistent, recurring revenue and strong operating margins and requires limited maintenance capital expenditures. As a multi-brand operator, we continually look to diversify and grow our portfolio of brands either through acquisition or organic brand development. Our acquisition strategy typically targets businesses that are highly cash flow generative with compelling unit economics that can be scaled by adding franchise, dealer and company-owned units, or that can be restructured to enhance performance and value to Franchise Group. We strive to create value for our stockholders by generating free cash flow and capital-efficient growth across economic cycles.
Our business segments include The Vitamin Shoppe (“Vitamin Shoppe”), Pet Supplies Plus, Badcock Home Furniture & more (“Badcock”), American Freight, Buddy’s Home Furnishings (“Buddy’s”), and Sylvan Learning (“Sylvan”). As of the year ended December 31, 2022, on a combined basis, we operated 3,029 locations consisting of 1,310 franchised locations, 1,401 company-run locations and 318 dealer locations. Each of our companies has its own management team with significant experience in its respective industry. Additionally, we offer our brands a shared services platform that allows us to drive economies of scale, efficiencies and best practices. We believe our platform enables our portfolio of brands to be stronger together than they are apart. 
We believe our financial performance and business model have been resilient across economic cycles and recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our franchised business model is designed to generate consistent, recurring revenue and predictable free cash flow in order to insulate us from the operating cost variability of our franchised locations. The operating costs of our franchised locations are borne by our franchisees themselves; however, royalties paid by our franchisees to us could be dependent upon our franchisees’ ability to effectively manage these operating costs. That is why we strive to deliver to our franchisees a best-in-class franchise program through, among other things, our knowledge of the business, operational support and training. 
We believe our success is driven in large part by our mutually beneficial relationships with our individual franchisees and dealers. Our franchise and dealer programs are designed to promote consistency and we are selective in granting franchises and dealerships. We are focused on partnering with franchisees and dealers who have the commitment, capability and capitalization to grow our brands. Franchisees and dealers can range in size from individuals owning just one location to publicly-traded companies. 
While the specific terms of our franchise agreements vary among our brands, we utilize both store-level franchise and multi-unit development programs. Under both types of franchise programs, franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land, building, equipment, signs, inventory and supplies. Both store-level franchise and multi-unit development agreements typically require payment to us of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening a store, fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee. Franchisees also pay monthly royalties based on a percentage of their store sales and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand.
Additionally, our Badcock segment offers dealership agreements, whereby a dealer is granted a non-exclusive license for use at designated premises to operate the dealership devoted exclusively to the sale of merchandise and other approved activities. There are no fees that are paid by the dealer for entering into a dealership agreement. However, the dealers are able to earn and may be entitled to receive a commission, as determined by Badcock, upon the sale of merchandise consigned by Badcock to the dealer.
We seek to maintain healthy relationships with our franchisees, dealers and their representatives. We invest a significant amount of time working with the franchisee and dealer community on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements, standards and management techniques.
Our Brands
Our Vitamin Shoppe segment is an omnichannel specialty retailer and wellness lifestyle company with the mission of providing customers with the most trusted products, guidance and services to help them become their best selves, however they define it. Vitamin Shoppe offers one of the largest varieties of products among vitamin, mineral and supplement retailers. The broad product offering enables Vitamin Shoppe to provide our customers with a depth of selection of products that may not be readily available at other specialty retailers or mass merchants, such as discount stores, supermarkets, drug stores and wholesale clubs. Vitamin Shoppe continues to focus on improving the customer experience through the roll-out of initiatives including 
increasing customer engagement and personalization, enhancing the omnichannel experience (including in stores, online and on mobile devices), growing private brands and improving the effectiveness of pricing and promotions.
Our Pet Supplies Plus segment is a leading omnichannel retail chain and franchisor of pet supplies and services. Pet Supplies Plus has a diversified revenue model comprised of company-owned store revenue, franchise royalties and revenue generated by the wholesale distribution of products to its franchisees. Pet Supplies Plus offers a curated selection of premium brands, proprietary private label and specialty products with retail price parity with online competitors. Additionally, Pet Supplies Plus offers grooming, pet wash and other services in most of its locations. Our Pet Supplies Plus segment’s wholly-owned subsidiary Wag N’ Wash is an emerging grooming, pet-wash and natural pet food franchise. Wag N’ Wash is primarily focused on dogs, has a store footprint that is substantially smaller than a Pet Supplies Plus location and is operated by the Pet Supplies Plus management.
Our Badcock segment is a retailer of furniture, appliances, bedding, electronics, home office equipment, accessories and seasonal items in a showroom format. Additionally, Badcock offers multiple and flexible payment solutions and credit options through third parties and its consumer financing services. We are in the process of moving its consumer financing services business to a third-party provider.
Our American Freight segment is a retail chain offering in-store and online access to furniture, mattresses, new and out-of-box home appliances and home accessories at discount prices. American Freight buys direct from manufacturers and sells direct in warehouse-style stores. By cutting out the middleman and keeping its overhead costs low, American Freight is well positioned to offer quality products at low prices. Our American Freight segment provides customers with multiple payment options, including third-party financing, providing access to high-quality products and brand name appliances that may otherwise remain aspirational to some of its customers.
American Freight also serves as a liquidation channel for major appliance vendors. American Freight operates specialty distribution centers that test out-of-box appliances before they are offered for sale to customers. Customers typically are covered by the original manufacturer’s warranty and are offered the opportunity to purchase a full suite of extended-service plans and services. 
Our Buddy’s segment is a specialty retailer of high quality, name brand consumer electronic, residential furniture, appliances and household accessories through rent-to-own agreements. The rental transaction allows our customers the opportunity to benefit from the use of high-quality products under flexible rental purchase agreements without long-term obligations.
Our Sylvan Learning segment is an established and growing franchisor of supplemental education for Pre-K-12 students and families. Sylvan addresses the full range of student needs with a broad variety of academic curriculums delivered in an omnichannel format. The Sylvan platform provides franchisees with the ability to provide a range of supplemental educational services, including on premises, virtually, at a satellite location and in the home.
Competition
Each of our brands competes with many well-established companies on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. The Vitamin Shoppe competes in the highly competitive nutritional supplements retail industry, in which competition is based primarily on quality, product assortment, price, customer service, convenience, marketing support and availability of new products. American Freight and Badcock primarily compete with discount retailers of furniture and mattresses and with big box retailers and locally-owned appliance retailers that sell new-in-box and liquidations of their out-of-box or as-is appliances. Pet Supplies Plus competes in the highly competitive pet products retail industry, in which competition is based primarily on quality, product assortment, price, customer service, convenience, marketing support and availability of new products. Buddy’s competes with other national, regional and local rent-to-own businesses, including online only competitors, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Sylvan competes with other national, regional and local tutoring centers, including online only competitors.
Business Strategy 
Our strategy is to focus on the operation and acquisition of franchise and franchisable businesses. We strive to assemble a mix of businesses that we believe provide us balance and overall economic resiliency, while also allowing us to benefit from the scale of a single franchising platform.
As a multi-brand operator, we continually look to diversify and grow our portfolio of brands either through acquisition or organic brand development. Our acquisition strategy typically targets businesses that are cash flow generative with unit economics that can be scaled by adding franchise and company-owned units, or that can be restructured to enhance performance and value to Franchise Group. 
We have established a corporate platform that enables us to deploy capital to acquire diversified assets that may become more valuable as part of our Company. Across all businesses, we look to create operating efficiencies in order to drive incremental free cash flow while allowing the management teams of each brand to focus on growing their businesses. Furthermore, our aggregated platform of multiple brands and increased scale provides cost of capital advantages relative to financing each business alone. 
We believe our portfolio of brands will allow us to offer franchisees a variety of platforms that will allow them to diversify their investment portfolio in a local area, optimize their geographic penetration and grow their businesses. We believe our investors will benefit from sustainable franchise royalties and opportunistic franchise sales. Furthermore, we expect our refranchising strategy to create cash inflows to opportunistically de-lever and acquire additional brands.
Impact of COVID-19
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have experienced some supply chain delays and disruptions, including adverse consequences to our supply chain function from decreased procurement volumes in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, while fiscal stimulus provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business positively by boosting the consumption of our products, the resulting surge in inflation from the fiscal stimulus and supply chain constraints contributed to price tension and reduced sales activity. We believe that the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our business and financial results by weakening demand for our products and services, further disrupting our supply chain or affecting our ability to raise capital from financial institutions. As events continue to change, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations due to uncertainties including, but not limited to, the severity of the disease, the impact of new subvariants and the public’s response to the outbreak; however, we are actively managing our business to respond to the impact.
Change of Year-End
For the years ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, our fiscal year ended on the Saturday in December closest to December 31st. On February 22, 2022, our Board of Directors (“Board”) approved a change in our fiscal year-end from the last Saturday in December closest to December 31st to the Saturday in December or January, whichever is closest to December 31st. Fiscal year 2022 ended on December 31, 2022 and included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter and Fiscal years 2021 and 2020 included 52 weeks.
Human Capital Management
General
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 8,575 full-time and 5,662 part-time employees. Part-time employees work an average of fewer than 30 hours per work. The number of part-time employees fluctuates based on seasonal needs. We believe that we have developed strong relations with our employees. Our employees are a key source of our competitive advantage and their actions are expected to be guided by our values and by an underlying set of ethical principles as incorporated into our Code of Conduct. We believe these values strengthen our culture and our workforce. We strive to demonstrate to our customers, franchisees, dealers, stockholders, business partners, communities and employees that we are worthy of their trust and continually strive to enhance our brand reputation.
The success of our business relies on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. To attract and retain talent, we strive to create an inclusive, diverse and supportive workplace, with opportunities for our employees to develop and grow in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs.
Our franchises and dealerships are independently owned and operated businesses. As such, employees of our franchisees and dealers are not employees of the Company. 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board (our “NCG Committee”) oversees our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) policies and activities which includes human capital management. The NCG Committee also oversees activities including the review of management’s strategies, activities, policies and goals with regard to environmental sustainability, climate change, human rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives. Our NCG Committee advises the Board on significant ESG-related feedback from stakeholders and makes recommendations on how the Company can adapt to ESG trends and regulatory developments that could impact its operations, performance or reputation. Our NCG Committee also has the responsibility to update and make recommendations to our Board on the impact of our human capital management strategies as outlined in its charter, subject to NCG Committee and Board approval. In 2022, our NCG Committee recommended, and our Board approved, the implementation of the Company’s ESG, DEI and Human Rights policies.
Corporate Culture
We are focused on creating a corporate culture of integrity and respect, with the goal of working together to drive our business to be innovative and competitive. We operate in a performance-based environment where results matter and financial discipline is enforced. We strive to create a highly collaborative culture in which employees feel that their input is encouraged and valued. At the same time, we believe in holding individuals accountable and endeavor to create a culture in which employees do what they say they are going to do. We believe that our culture is a long-term competitive advantage for us, fuels our ability to execute our business strategy and is a critical component of our employee talent strategy. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success. Our goal is to cultivate an inclusive environment where human differences are valued, respected and supported. We believe that maintaining a diverse leadership and employee base allows us to take advantage of the array of innovation, creativity and talent of our human capital. We have taken actions to recruit, retain, develop and advance a diverse and talented workforce. At the close of fiscal 2022, women represented 43.2% of our total workforce, with increased representation both in technical and executive roles across the enterprise, and underrepresented minorities represented 37.6% of our total workforce. At the close of fiscal 2022, the representation of women in executive management was 41.8% collectively across all segments, management and the Board. We are an equal opportunity employer. We respect diversity and do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, sex, gender, gender identity or expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, veteran status, physical or mental disability, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local laws. Our management is dedicated to ensuring the fulfillment of this policy with respect to hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, demotion, layoff, separation, recruitment, pay and equity, access to facilities and programs, training and general treatment during employment. We invest in attracting, developing and retaining the best talent. We do this by communicating a clear purpose and strategy, transparent goal setting, driving accountability, continuously assessing, developing, advancing talent and a leadership-driven talent strategy. We also comply with the Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) Commission rules, including making our EEO reports publicly available. Our Vitamin Shoppe segment, as a government contractor, has an affirmative action plan that is updated annually.
With the support at the highest level of leadership to ensure we meet our goals for a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, in 2022, we established a DEI Committee comprised of senior leaders from each of our brands. Guided by our enterprise DEI Policy, the DEI Committee is charged with providing DEI-focused strategies for each Company brand, consistent with our business goals, to develop and implement DEI efforts and activities that are meaningful to our employees and the communities we serve.
Our DEI initiatives include, among other things:
•Establishing DEI as a recognized business interest, with every level of the organization taking responsibility for implementing DEI-focused strategies.
•Promoting respectful communication and cooperation between all employees regardless of title or level.
•Encouraging an environment where employees feel that their background and lifestyle do not affect perceptions of them as professionals or affect their opportunities for development and promotion.
•Fostering teamwork and employee participation, permitting the representation of all groups and employee perspectives.
•Ensuring the availability of flexible working practices where appropriate, to accommodate employees’ varying needs.
•Encouraging employer and employee contributions to the communities we serve to promote a greater understanding and respect for DEI.
Health, Safety and Wellness 
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs, including programs that support their physical and mental health. We are continually focused on the safety of our associates and have a strong emphasis on identifying and addressing the safety risks and concerns of our associates. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, a top priority of the Company has been the health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families. Our management teams continue to monitor, identify and address emerging risks to formulate our response to actions taken by governments and public policy organizations. We base our protocols on guidance from healthcare experts and public health leaders, and regularly review and update them to reflect the best, most current information available.
Compensation, Benefits and Human Rights
We are committed to providing each of our employees a fair and equitable wage. We believe we provide competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees. In addition to competitive salaries, these programs include, among other items, bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) plan, health and wellness programs, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
We recognize the importance of maintaining and promoting the fundamental human rights of employees and, in 2022, we implemented a Human Rights Policy that: promotes a workplace free of discrimination and harassment; prohibits child labor, forced labor and human trafficking; provides fair and equitable wages, benefits and other conditions of employment in accordance with all applicable labor and employment laws; provides safe working conditions in accordance with all applicable labor and employment laws; and recognizes an employee’s right to associate or not to associate.
Ethics Hotline
We maintain an Ethics Hotline that is available to all employees to report (anonymously if desired) any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline are routed to Human Resources, Legal and Executive Management for investigation and resolution. In certain instances, such communications may also be escalated, pursuant to our internal policies, to the Audit Committee of our Board for review, investigation and resolution. In addition, any stockholder or other interested party may send communications to us or our Board through our website.
