Item 1.    BUSINESS.
Summary
LCI Industries (“LCII” and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or the “Registrant”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lippert Components, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Lippert Components” or “LCI”), supplies, domestically and internationally, a broad array of components for the leading original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of recreational vehicles (“RVs”) and adjacent industries including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; trucks; pontoon boats; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing. The Company also supplies components to the related aftermarkets of these industries, primarily by selling to retail dealers, wholesale distributors and service centers.
LCI’s products include steel chassis and related components; axles and suspension solutions; slide-out mechanisms and solutions; thermoformed bath, kitchen and other products; vinyl, aluminum and frameless windows; manual, electric and hydraulic stabilizer and leveling systems; furniture and mattresses; entry, luggage, patio and ramp doors; electric and manual entry steps; awnings and awning accessories; electronic components; televisions and sound systems; navigation systems; backup cameras; appliances; and other accessories.
The Company has two reportable segments: the original equipment manufacturers segment (the “OEM Segment”) and the aftermarket segment (the “Aftermarket Segment”). The OEM Segment accounted for 92 percent of consolidated net sales for 2016, and the Aftermarket Segment accounted for 8 percent of consolidated net sales for 2016. Approximately 71 percent of the Company’s OEM Segment net sales in 2016 were of products sold to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs.
The Company is focused on profitable growth in its industries, both organic and through acquisitions. In order to support this growth, over the past several years the Company has expanded its geographic market and product lines, consolidated manufacturing facilities, and integrated manufacturing, distribution and administrative functions. At December 31, 2016, the Company operated 48 manufacturing and distribution facilities located throughout the United States and in Canada and Italy, and reported consolidated net sales of $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 20, 1984, and is the successor to Drew National Corporation, which was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1962. The Company’s principal executive and administrative offices are located at 3501 County Road 6 East, Elkhart, Indiana 46514; telephone number (574) 535-1125; website www.lci1.com; e-mail LCII@lci1.com. The Company makes available free of charge on its website its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K (and amendments to those reports) filed with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed.
Recent Developments
Sales and Profits
Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to a record $1.7 billion, 20 percent higher than the consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.4 billion. Acquisitions completed by the Company in 2016 added $64 million in net sales. A 15 percent increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, the Company’s primary OEM market, as well as increased content per RV unit, positively impacted net sales growth. Further, the Company organically increased sales to adjacent industries and the aftermarket. Net income for the full-year 2016 increased to $129.7 million, or $5.20 per diluted share, up from net income of $74.3 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, in 2015.
In Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the Company describes in detail the increase in its sales and profits during 2016.
Acquisitions
During 2016 and early 2017, the Company completed six acquisitions:
In January 2016, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of the pontoon furniture manufacturing operation of Highwater Marine, LLC (“Highwater”), a leading manufacturer of pontoon and other recreational boats located in Elkhart, Indiana. The purchase price was $10.0 million paid at closing.

In February 2016, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of Flair Interiors, Inc. (“Flair”), a manufacturer of RV furniture located in Goshen, Indiana. The purchase price was $8.1 million paid at closing.
In May 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the equity interest of Project 2000 S.r.l. (“Project 2000”), a manufacturer of innovative, space-saving bed lifts and retractable steps, located near Florence, Italy. The purchase price was $18.8 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales by this operation.
In November 2016, the Company acquired the business, manufacturing facility and certain assets of the seating and chassis components business of Atwood Mobile Products, LLC (“Atwood”), a subsidiary of Dometic Group, located in Elkhart, Indiana. The purchase price was $12.5 million paid at closing.

In February 2017, the Company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Sessa Klein S.p.A. (“SessaKlein”), a manufacturer of highly engineered side window systems for both high speed and commuter trains, located near Varese, Italy. The purchase price was $8.5 million paid at closing, plus contingent consideration based on future sales by this operation.
Other Developments
In March 2016, the Company initiated a regular quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, which was increased later in the year to $0.50 per share. During 2016, total dividends of $1.40 per share of common stock, representing an aggregate of $34.4 million, were paid to stockholders.
In December 2016, the Company announced a change of the Company’s corporate name to LCI Industries from Drew Industries Incorporated. Lippert Components’ business has grown considerably over the past decade, and the new corporate name was selected to better align the investment community with the strength of the LCI brand in the industries it serves.
OEM Segment
Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company manufactures or distributes a broad array of components for the leading OEMs of RVs and adjacent industries, including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; trucks; pontoon boats; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing.
In 2016, the OEM Segment represented 92 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales and 90 percent of consolidated segment operating profit. Approximately 71 percent of the Company’s OEM Segment net sales in 2016 were of products to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheel travel trailers, folding camping trailers and truck campers).
Raw materials used by the Company’s OEM Segment, consisting primarily of steel (coil, sheet, tube and I-beam), extruded aluminum, glass, wood, fabric and foam are available from a number of sources, both domestic and foreign.
Operations of the Company’s OEM Segment consist primarily of fabricating, welding, thermoforming, painting, sewing and assembling components into finished products. The Company’s OEM Segment operations are conducted at 48 manufacturing and warehouse facilities throughout the United States, and in Canada and Italy, strategically located in proximity to the customers they serve. See Item 2. “Properties.”
The Company’s OEM Segment products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of RVs such as Thor Industries (symbol: THO), Forest River (a Berkshire Hathaway company, symbol: BRKA), Winnebago (symbol: WGO) and other RV OEMs, and to manufacturers in adjacent industries.
The RV industry is highly competitive, both among manufacturers of RVs and the suppliers of RV components, generally with low barriers to entry other than compliance with industry standards, codes and safety requirements, and the initial capital investment required to establish manufacturing operations. The Company competes with several other component suppliers on a regional and national basis with respect to a broad array of components for both towable and motorized RVs. The Company’s operations compete on the basis of product quality and reliability, product innovation, price, customer service and customer satisfaction. Although definitive information is not readily available, the Company believes with respect to its principal RV products (i) it is the leading supplier of windows and doors for towable RVs; (ii) it is the leading supplier of chassis and slide-out mechanisms 
7

for towable RVs; (iii) the leading suppliers of axles for towable RVs are the Company and Dexter Axle Company; (iv) it is the leading supplier of furniture for towable RVs, and the Company competes with several other manufacturers; (v) the Company is the leading supplier of leveling systems for towable RVs; and (vi) the leading suppliers of awnings for towable RVs are the Company, Carefree of Colorado and Dometic Corporation.
The Company’s share of the market for its products in adjacent industries cannot be readily determined; however, OEM Segment net sales to adjacent industries increased from $275 million in 2015 to $332 million in 2016, 21 percent of total OEM Segment net sales. The Company has made investments in people, technology and equipment to increase its share of the market in adjacent industries and is committed to continue these expansion efforts.
Detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the OEM Segment is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Financial information relating to the Company’s business segments is included in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Aftermarket Segment
Many of the Company’s OEM Segment products are also sold through various aftermarket channels, including dealerships, warehouse distributors and service centers, as well as direct to retail customers. The Company has teams dedicated to product training and marketing support for its Aftermarket customers. The Company also supports two call centers to provide quick responses to customers for both product delivery and technical support. This support is designed for a rapid response to critical repairs so customer downtime is minimized. The Aftermarket Segment also includes the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims. Many of the optional upgrades and non-critical replacements are purchased outside the normal product selling seasons, thereby causing Aftermarket sales to be counter-seasonal.
According to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (“RVIA”), current estimated RV ownership had increased to nearly nine million units. Additionally, as a result of a vibrant secondary market, one third of current owners purchased their RV new while the remaining two-thirds purchased a previously owned RV. This vibrant secondary market is a key driver for the aftermarket, as the Company anticipates owners of previously owned RVs will likely upgrade their units as well as replace parts and accessories which have been subjected to normal wear and tear.
Aftermarket net sales increased from $103 million in 2015 to $131 million in 2016. The Company continues to make investments in people and technology to grow the Aftermarket Segment and is committed to continue these expansion efforts.
Detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the Aftermarket Segment is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Financial information relating to the Company’s business segments is included in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Sales and Marketing
The Company’s sales activities are related to developing new customer relationships and maintaining existing customer relationships, primarily through the quality and reliability of its products, innovation, price, customer service and customer satisfaction. As a result of the Company’s strategic decision to increase its sales to the aftermarket and adjacent industries, as well as expand into international markets, the Company has increased its annual marketing and advertising expenditures over the past few years, which were approximately $3 million in 2016.
The Company has several supply agreements or other arrangements with certain of its customers that provide for prices of various products to be fixed for periods generally not in excess of eighteen months; however, in certain cases the Company has the right to renegotiate the prices on sixty-days’ notice. Both the OEM Segment and the Aftermarket Segment typically ship products on average within one to two weeks of receipt of orders from their customers and, as a result, neither segment has any significant backlog.
Capacity
In 2016, the Company’s facilities operated at an average of approximately 55 percent of their practical capacity, assuming at least two shifts of production at all facilities. However, while certain facilities could add a second shift of production in the short term, the Company has found this to be inefficient over the long term. Capacity varies significantly based on seasonal demand, as well as by facility, product line and geographic region, with certain facilities at times operating below 50 percent utilization, and other facilities at times operating above 90 percent utilization.
8

At December 31, 2016, the Company operated 48 manufacturing and distribution facilities, and for most products has the ability to fill demand in excess of capacity at individual facilities by shifting production to other facilities, but the Company would incur additional freight costs. Capital expenditures for 2016 were $45 million, and included approximately $25 million of “replacement” capital expenditures and approximately $20 million of “growth” capital expenditures. The ability to expand capacity in certain product areas, if necessary, as well as the potential to reallocate existing resources, is monitored regularly by management to help ensure the Company can maintain a high level of production efficiencies throughout its operations.
Seasonality
Most industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used, historically have been seasonal and generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company’s sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, the timing of dealer orders, as well as the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years. Additionally, sales of components to the aftermarket channels of these industries tend to be counter-seasonal.
International
Over the past several years, the Company has been gradually growing international sales, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately 2 percent, 1 percent and 1 percent of consolidated net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company continues to focus on developing products tailored for international RV markets. The Company participates in the largest RV shows in Europe and has been receiving positive feedback on its products, especially its proprietary slide-out products. The Company has spent more than two years developing three slide-out systems suited to the needs of the European market, which were recently featured on new RV models. As a result, the Company believes it will see additional orders from European RV OEMs. The Company’s Director of International Business Development spends time in Australia, Europe and other international markets, assessing the dynamics of the local marketplace, building relationships with OEMs and helping the Company introduce its existing products and develop new products for those markets, with the goal of identifying long-term growth opportunities. The Company estimates the addressable market for annual net sales of its products outside of North America to be $750 million.
In May 2016, the Company acquired Project 2000 S.r.l., a manufacturer of motorized entry steps, bed lifts and RV accessories located near Florence, Italy, as a foundation for LCI in the European RV market. In February 2017, the Company also acquired Sessa Klein S.p.A., a manufacturer of highly engineered side window systems for both high speed and commuter trains located near Varese, Italy. The acquisition of Sessa Klein introduces the Company to a new adjacent industry for the European and U.S. train markets, and, the Company believes, will accelerate the opportunities to expand LCI's product offerings for the European RV market.
Intellectual Property
The Company holds over 200 United States and foreign patents and has nearly 60 patent applications pending that relate to various products sold by the Company. The Company has also granted certain licenses that permit third parties to manufacture and sell products in consideration for royalty payments. 
From time to time, the Company has received notices or claims it may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of others, and the Company has given notices to, or asserted claims against, others that they may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of the Company. The Company believes its patents are valuable and vigorously protects its patents when appropriate.
Research and Development
The Company strives to be an industry leader in product innovation and is focused on developing new products, as well as improving existing products. Research and development expenditures are expensed as they are incurred. Research and development expenses were approximately $9 million, $8 million and $5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of our products. Sales and manufacturing operations in foreign countries may be subject to similar regulations.
9

Rules promulgated under the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act (the “Tread Act”) require manufacturers of motor vehicles and certain motor vehicle related equipment to regularly make reports and submit documents and certain historical data to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to enhance motor vehicle safety, and to respond to requests for information relating to specific complaints or incidents.
Trailers produced by the Company for hauling boats, personal watercraft, snowmobiles and equipment must comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) promulgated by NHTSA relating to lighting, braking, wheels, tires and other vehicle systems.
Windows and doors produced by the Company for the RV industry must comply with regulations promulgated by NHTSA governing safety glass performance, egress ability, door hinge and lock systems, egress window retention hardware, and baggage door ventilation. Windows produced by the Company for buses also must comply with FMVSS promulgated by NHTSA.
Upholstered products and mattresses produced by the Company for RVs and buses must comply with FMVSS promulgated by NHTSA regarding flammability. In addition, upholstered products and mattresses produced by the Company for RVs must comply with regulations promulgated by the Consumer Products Safety Commission regarding flammability, as well as standards for toxic chemical levels and labeling requirements promulgated by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. Plywood, particleboard and fiberboard used in RV products are required to comply with standards for formaldehyde emission levels promulgated by the California Air Resources Board and adopted by the RVIA.
Windows and entry doors produced by the Company for manufactured homes must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and by the American Architectural Manufacturers Association relating to air and water infiltration, structural integrity, thermal performance, emergency exit conformance, and hurricane resistance. Certain of the Company’s products must also comply with the International Code Council standards, such as the IRC (International Residential Code), the IBC (International Building Code), and the IECC (International Energy Conservation Code) as well as state and local building codes. Thermoformed bath products manufactured by the Company for manufactured homes must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by HUD.
The Company believes it is currently operating in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations and has made reports and submitted information as required. The Company does not believe the expense of compliance with these laws and regulations, as currently in effect, will have a material effect on the Company's operations, financial condition or competitive position; however, there can be no assurance this trend will continue as health and safety laws, regulations or other pertinent requirements evolve.
Environmental
The Company’s operations are subject to certain federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to the use, storage, discharge, transport and disposal of hazardous materials used during the manufacturing processes. Although the Company believes its operations have been consistent with prevailing industry standards, and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, one or more of the Company’s current or former operating sites, or adjacent sites owned by third-parties, have been affected by releases of hazardous materials. As a result, the Company may incur expenditures for future investigation and remediation of these sites, including in conjunction with voluntary remediation programs or third party claims. In the past, environmental compliance costs have not had, and are not expected in the future to have, a material effect on the Company’s operations or financial condition; however, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.
Employees
The number of persons employed full-time by the Company at December 31, 2016 was 7,654, compared to 6,576 and 6,187 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total at December 31, 2016 included 6,295 in manufacturing, 337 in transportation, 103 in sales, 230 in customer support and servicing, and 689 in administration. None of the employees of the Company are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
