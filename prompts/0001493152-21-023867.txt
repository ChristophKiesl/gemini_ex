ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview
 
We design, develop, manufacture, and sell advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for the material handling sector which includes lift trucks, airport ground support equipment (“GSE”), and other industrial and commercial applications. We believe our mobile and stationary energy storage solutions provide customers with a reliable, high performing, cost effective, and more environmentally friendly alternative as compared to traditional lead acid and propane-based solutions. Our modular and scalable design allows different configurations of lithium-ion battery packs to be paired with our proprietary wireless battery management system (“SkyBMS”) to provide the level of energy storage required and “state of the art” real time monitoring of pack performance. We believe that the increasing demand for lithium-ion battery packs in the material handling sector continues to drive our current revenue growth.
Our Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to meet the rapidly growing demand for lithium-ion energy storage solutions and to be the supplier of choice, targeting large fleets of forklifts and GSEs as a priority. We intend to reach this goal by investing in research and development to expand our product mix, expanding our sales and marketing efforts, improving our customer support efforts and continuing our efforts to improve production capacity and efficiencies. Our research and development efforts will continue to focus on providing adaptable, reliable and cost effective energy storage solutions for customers. In addition, our strategy includes obtaining Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”) Listing on most of our products. We believe that a UL Listing demonstrates the safety, reliability and durability of our products and gives us an important competitive advantage over other lithium-ion energy suppliers. Many of our LiFT Packs have been approved for use by leading industrial motive manufacturers, including Toyota Material Handling USA, Inc., Crown Equipment Corporation, and The Raymond Corporation.
 
Within our industrial market segments, we believe that our lithium-ion LiFT Pack solutions provide cost, performance and environmental benefits over existing lead acid batteries and propane-based power solutions including:



● | longer operation and multiple shifts with fewer batteries; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------
● | reduced energy and maintenance costs; 
● | faster recharging; and 
● | longer lifespan. 

 
Additionally, the toxic nature of lead acid batteries presents significant safety and environmental issues as they are subject to Environmental Protection Agency lead acid battery reporting requirements, may create an environmental hazard in the event of a cell breach, and emit combustible gases during charging.
 
As a result of the advantages lithium-ion battery technology provide over lead acid batteries, we have experienced significant growth in our business. We believe the industry is gaining strong momentum of a trend toward the adoption of lithium-ion technology to displace lead acid and propane-based energy storage solutions, and based on North American sales data from the Industrial Truck Association (“ITA”), we estimate the market to be a multi-billion dollar per year opportunity. 
 
Critical to our success is our innovative and proprietary versatile BMS that optimizes the performance of our lithium-ion energy solutions and provides a platform for adding new battery pack features, including customized telemetry (pack data and reports available anytime, anywhere) for customers. The BMS serves as the brain of the battery pack, managing cell balancing, charging, discharging, monitoring and communication between the pack and the forklift.

DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
 
Our Business
 
We have leveraged our experience in lithium-ion technology to design and develop a suite of LiFT Pack and related industrial and commercial product lines that we believe provide attractive solutions to customers seeking an alternative to lead acid and propane-based power products. We believe that the following attributes are significant contributors to our success:
 
Engineering and integration experience in lithium-ion for motive applications: We have been developing lithium-ion applications for the advanced energy storage market since 2010, starting with products for automotive electric vehicle manufacturers. We believe our experience enables us to develop superior solutions as we have sold over 10,000 packs in the field to customers.
 
UL Listing: We launched our Class 3 Walkie LiFT Pack product line in 2014 and obtained UL Listing for all three different power configurations. We have also obtained UL Listing for our Class 1 LiFT Packs and our Class 2 LiFT Packs, and our Class 3 End Rider. In addition, we have recently completed the process for obtaining UL Listings for our new source of battery cells. We believe this UL Listing provides us a significant competitive advantage and provides assurance to customers that our technology has been rigorously tested by an independent third party and determined to be safe, durable and reliable.
 
Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) approvals: Many of our LiFT Packs have been tested and approved for use by Toyota Material Handling USA, Inc., Crown Equipment Corporation, and The Raymond Corporation, among the top global lift truck manufacturers by revenue according to Material Handling & Logistics. We also provide a “private label” Class 3 Walkie LiFT Pack to a major forklift OEM.
 
Broad product offering and scalable design: We offer LiFT Packs for use in a variety of industrial motive applications. We believe that our modular and scalable design enables us to optimize design, inventory, and part count to accommodate natural product extensions of our products to meet customer requirements. We have leveraged our Class 3 Walkie LiFT Pack design to develop larger LiFT Packs for larger forklifts, GSE Packs, and other industrial equipment applications. Natural product extensions, based on our modular, scalable designs, include solar backup power for electric vehicle (“EV”) mobile charging stations and robotic warehouse equipment.
 
Significant advantages over lead acid and propane-based solutions: We believe that lithium-ion battery systems have significant advantages over existing technologies and will displace lead acid batteries and propane-based solutions, in most applications. Relative to lead acid batteries, such advantages include environmental benefits, no water maintenance, faster charge times, greater cycle life, longer run times, and less energy used that provide operational and financial benefits to customers. When compared to lead acid solutions, our energy storage solutions do not discharge carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to lithium chemistry efficiencies In addition, when compared to propane-based solutions, lithium-ion systems avoid the generation of exhaust emissions and associated odor and environmental contaminates, and maintenance of an internal combustion engine, which has substantially more parts subject to wear than an electric motor.

Proprietary Battery Management System: We have developed our “next generation” versatile BMS that is currently being rolled out into our full product lines and which provides significant product features for improved customer productivity. Our BMS serves as the brain of the battery pack, managing cell balancing, charging, discharging, monitoring and communication between the pack and the forklift. Our BMS is specifically designed for the industrial motive application environment and is adaptable to meet custom requirements. Our BMS also enables ongoing feature development for reduced cost and higher performance. We have introduced our proprietary telemetry solution, branded “SkyBMS” which provides real time reports on pack performance, health, and remaining useful life.
 
Our Products
 
We have developed, tested, and sold our LiFT Packs for use in a broad range of lift trucks, including Class 3 Walkie and End Riders, Class 2 Narrow Aisle, and Class 1 Ride-on, as well as for industrial equipment including airport ground support equipment (“GSE”), energy storage for solar applications, and other commercial applications. Within each of these product segments, there is a range of power and equipment variations. Our LiFT Packs fit most of these variations, with only minor modifications needed to fit the remaining low volume applications. This equipment is described in more detail below.
 

Our battery pack system design is modular with three core design modules used in our entire family of small, medium, and large pack forklift products. The design of each core module is driven by power requirements and physical space sizing. We utilize our three core design modules to develop packs for other industrial and commercial applications, to meet power and space requirements. We offer varying chemistries and configurations based on the specific application. Currently, our LiFT Packs use lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery cells, which we source from a variety of overseas suppliers that meet our power, reliability, safety and other specifications. Our BMS works with a number of battery chemistries providing us with the flexibility to use battery cells developed and manufactured by other suppliers. We believe we can readily adapt our LiFT Packs to incorporate new chemistries as they become available in the future in order to meet changing customer preferences and to reduce the cost of our products.
 
We also offer 24-volt onboard chargers for our Class 3 Walkie LiFT Packs, and smart “wall mounted” chargers for larger applications. Our smart charging solutions are designed to interface with our BMS and integrate easily into most all major chargers in the market.
 
Industry Overview
 
Historically, lithium-ion battery solutions were unable to compete with lead acid and propane-based solutions in industrial applications on the basis of cost. However, the supply of lithium-ion batteries has rapidly expanded, leading to price declines of eighty-five percent (85%) since 2010 according to BloombergNEF. BloombergNEF also estimates that lithium-ion battery prices, which averaged $1,160 per kilowatt hour in 2010, were $156 per kWh in 2019 and could drop below $100 per kWh in 2024.

The sharp decline in the price of lithium-ion batteries has made these energy solutions more cost competitive. Affordability has in turn enabled customers to shift away from lead acid and propane-based solutions for power lift equipment to lithium-ion based solutions with more favorable environmental and performance characteristics. We believe our position as a pioneer in the field and our extensive experience providing lithium-ion based energy storage solutions makes us uniquely positioned to take advantage of this shift in customer preferences.
 
Lift Equipment - Material Handling Equipment
 
We focus on energy storage solutions for lift equipment and related industrial applications because we believe they represent large and growing markets that are just beginning to adopt lithium-ion based technology. We apply our scalable, modular designs to natural product extensions in the industrial equipment market. These markets include not only the sale of lithium-ion battery solutions for new equipment but also a replacement market for existing lead acid battery packs.
 
According to Modern Materials Handling, worldwide new lift truck orders reached approximately 1.4 million units in 2017. The Industrial Truck Association has estimated that approximately 200,000 lift trucks had been sold yearly since 2013 in North America (Canada, the United States and Mexico), with sales relatively evenly distributed between electric rider (Class 1 and Class 2), motorized hand (Class 3), and internal combustion engine powered lift trucks (Class 4 and Class 5). The ITA estimates that electric products represented approximately sixty-nine percent (69%) of the North American shipments in 2020, reflecting the long term trend of increasing mix of electric products versus internal combustion (propane) engines. Driven by growth in global manufacturing, e-commerce and construction, Research and Markets expects that the global lift truck market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of six and four-tenths percent (6.4%) through 2024.
 
Customers
 
Our customers include OEMs, lift equipment dealers, battery distributors and end users. Our customers vary from small companies to Fortune 500 companies.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2021, we had three (3) major customers that each represented more than 10% of our revenues on an individual basis, and together represented approximately $16,004,000 or 61% of our total revenues. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we had three (3) major customers that each represented more than 10% of our revenues on an individual basis, and together represented approximately $10,045,000 or 60% of our total revenues.
Shift Toward Lithium-ion Battery Technologies
 
The lithium-ion battery value proposition of higher performance, environmental benefit, and lower life cycle cost is driving an increase in demand for safe and efficient alternatives to lead acid and propane-based power products. The lithium-ion value proposition includes a number of factors impacting customer preferences:
 
Duration of Charge/Run Times: Lithium-based energy storage systems can perform for a longer duration compared to lead acid batteries. Lithium-ion batteries provide up to 50% longer run times than lead acid batteries of comparable capacity, or amps-per-hour rating, allowing equipment to be operated over a long period of time between charges.
 
High/Sustained Power: Lithium-ion batteries are better suited to deliver high power versus legacy lead acid. For example, a 100Ah lead acid battery will only deliver 80Ah if discharged over a four-hour period. In contrast, a 100Ah lithium-ion system will achieve over 92Ah even during a 30-minute discharge. Additionally, during discharge, the LiFT Pack sustains its initial voltage, maximizing the performance of the forklift truck, whereas, lead acid voltages, and hence power, decline over the working shift.
 
Charging Time: Lead acid batteries are limited to one shift a day, as they discharge for eight hours, need eight hours for charging, and another eight hours for cooling. For multi-shift operations, this typically requires battery changeout for the equipment. Because lithium batteries can be recharged in as little as one hour and do not degrade when subjected to opportunity charging, hence, battery changeout is unnecessary.

Safe Operation: The toxic nature of lead acid batteries presents significant safety and environmental issues in the event of a cell breach. During charging, lead acid batteries emit combustible gases and increase in temperature. Lithium-ion (particularly LFP) batteries do not get as hot and avoid many of the safety and environmental issues associated with lead acid batteries.
 
Extended Life: The performance of lead acid batteries degrades after approximately 500 charging cycles in industrial equipment applications. In comparison, lithium-ion batteries last up to five times longer in the same application.
 
Size and Weight: Lithium is about one-third the weight of lead acid for comparable power ratings. Lower weight enables forklift OEMs the ability to optimize the design of the truck based on a smaller footprint for lithium-ion instead of lead acid.
 
Lower Cost: Lithium-ion batteries provide power dense solutions with extended cycle life, reduced maintenance and improved operational performance, resulting in lower total cost of ownership.
 
Less Energy Used: we believe our lithium-ion batteries use 20-50% less energy based on our internal studies comparing lithium-ion to lead acid.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
We sell our products through a number of different channels including OEMs, lift equipment dealers and battery distributors as well as directly to end users. In the industrial motive market, OEMs sell their lift products through dealer networks and directly to end customers. Because of environmental issues associated with lead acid batteries and to preserve customer choice, industrial lift products are typically sold without a battery pack. Equipment dealers source battery packs from battery distributors and battery pack suppliers based on demand or in response to customer specifications. End customers may specify a specific type and manufacturer of battery pack to the equipment dealer or may purchase battery packs from battery distributors or directly from battery suppliers.
 
Our direct sales staff is assigned to major geographies throughout North America to collaborate with our sales partners who have an established customer base. We plan to hire additional sales staff to support our expected sales growth. In addition, we have developed a nation-wide sales network of relationships with equipment OEMs, their dealers, and battery distributors. To support our products, we have a nation-wide network of service providers, typically forklift equipment dealers and battery distributors, who provide local customer service to large customers. We also maintain a call center and provide Tech Bulletins and training to our service and sales network out of our corporate headquarters. We have partnered with an experienced GSE distributor, to market our lithium-ion battery packs for airport GSE. We have typically experienced seasonality in our customers’ orders, often with lower sales in July, August and December.


Manufacturing and Assembly
 
Rather than manufacture our own battery cells and be limited to a single chemistry, our battery cells are sourced from a limited number of manufacturers located in China. We source the remainder of the components primarily from vendors in the United States. We developed our BMS to be agnostic to a battery’s lithium-ion chemistry and cell manufacturer. Despite such flexibility, we have experienced occasional supply interruptions in the past, and more recently, we have been forced to navigate supply chain and transportation issues stemming from the global pandemic. We are continuing to monitor and test potential new cell technologies on an ongoing basis to help mitigate our supply chain risks. Final assembly, testing and shipping of our products is done from our ISO 9001 certified facility in Vista, California, which includes three assembly lines.
 
We design our BMS modules/boards and have two granted patents: (i) a 12-volt battery design; and (ii) a battery display design. Component acquisition and assembly of the BMS modules/boards are outsourced to two local, Southern California board houses, both of whom meet our quality and other specifications.
 
We buy chargers from several sources, including a U.S. based supplier. Additionally, we are a qualified dealer for a well-known manufacturer of “high capacity, modular, smart chargers” which support our larger packs.

Research and Development
 
Our engineers design, develop, test, and service our advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions at our company headquarters in Vista, California. We believe our strengths include our core competencies and capabilities in designing and developing proprietary technology for our BMS, lean manufacturing processes, systems engineering, engineering application, and software engineering for both battery packs and telemetry. We believe that our ability to develop new features and technology for our BMS is essential to our growth strategy.
 
Research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $6.7 million and $5.0 million, respectively. Such expenses consisted primarily of materials, supplies, salaries and personnel related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, consulting costs and other expenses. Research and development expenses in the year ended June 30, 2021 were higher than the year ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to new product development activities.
 
As we continue to develop and expand our product offerings, we anticipate that research and development will continue to be a substantial part of our strategic priorities in the future. We seek to develop innovative new and improved products for cell and system management along with associated communication, display, current sensing and charging tools. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving performance, reliability and durability of our energy storage solutions for our customers and on lowering our costs of production.
 
Competition
 
Our competitors in the lift equipment market are primarily major lead acid battery manufacturers, including Stryten Energy, East Penn Manufacturing Company, EnerSys Corporation, and Crown Battery Corporation. Although several of these competitors offer a lithium-ion battery, we do not believe that these suppliers offer lithium-based products for lift equipment in any significant volume to end users, equipment dealers, OEMs or battery distributors. Several OEMs offer lithium-ion battery packs on Class 3 forklifts for sale only with their own new forklifts. Some OEMs also offer forklift models designed with an integrated lithium-ion battery. As the demand for lithium-ion battery packs has increased, several small lithium battery pack providers have entered the market, most of whom we believe are suppliers of other power products and have simply added a lithium product to their product lines.
 
The key competitive factors in this market are performance, reliability, durability, safety and price. We believe we compete effectively in all of these categories in light of our experience with lithium-ion technology, including our development capabilities and the performance of our proprietary BMS. We believe that the UL Listing covering many of our core products is a significant differentiating competitive advantage and we intend to extend that advantage by seeking to obtain UL Listings for our other LiFT pack products in the coming months. In addition, because our BMS is not reliant on any specific battery cell chemistry, we believe we can adapt rapidly to changes in advanced battery technology or customer preferences.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents pending, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. In addition to such factors as innovation, technological expertise and experienced personnel, we believe that a strong patent position is important to remain competitive.
 
As of June 30, 2021, we have two issued patents and three trademark registrations protecting the Flux Power name and logo. We are currently working to file three additional patent applications with respect to our technology, including our next generation BMS 2.0, which is now being rolled into production. We do not know whether any of our efforts will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. Our two issued patents include: (i) a 12-volt battery design and (ii) a battery display design.
 
Suppliers
 
We obtain a limited number of components and supplies included in our products from a small group of suppliers. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we had two (2) suppliers who accounted for more than 10% of our total purchases, on an individual basis, and together represented approximately $9,260,000 or 27% of our total purchases.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2020, we had two (2) suppliers who accounted for more than 10% of our total purchases, on an individual basis, and together represented approximately $6,598,000 or 35% of our total purchases.
