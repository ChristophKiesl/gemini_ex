Overview
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company on a quest to deliver targeted therapies that treat rare forms of cancer. Our main focus is the development of momelotinib, an investigational agent for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Currently, momelotinib is in a global Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with myelofibrosis, called the MOMENTUM study, that if successful will be registration enabling. At its completion, approximately 1,000 myelofibrosis patients will have received momelotinib, and several of our clinical trial patients remain on treatment more than 10 years later. 
 In the third quarter of 2018, we acquired momelotinib from Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead), which had completed several late-stage trials of the drug candidate in patients with myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is characterized by progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia and currently approved JAK inhibitor therapies, ruxolitinib and fedratinib, can induce or further exacerbate this myelosuppression, limiting their use in first line treatment and resulting in a population of second line patients who are no longer able to benefit from such therapies. Momelotinib is a novel, orally-bioavailable JAK1 (Janus kinase 1), JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and ACVR1 (Activin A receptor type 1) inhibitor with a differentiated mechanism of action, enabling it to potentially address all three hallmarks of disease in myelofibrosis: anemia of inflammation, constitutional symptoms and enlarged spleen. 
 In December 2018, we reported new data for momelotinib collated from the two completed SIMPLIFY Phase 3 clinical trials and a translational biology study in transfusion dependent patients with myelofibrosis. Data from the latter study were also concurrently presented in a poster at the 60th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition in San Diego, California. We reported aggregated transfusion independence responses from more than 150 intermediate and high-risk transfusion dependent myelofibrosis patients demonstrating robust and consistent response rates within and across the clinical studies. More than 44% of these patients became transfusion free for at least 12 weeks and nearly 50% were transfusion independent for at least 8 weeks. 
 In the second quarter of 2019, we announced that we had obtained regulatory clarity with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning the design of a Phase 3 clinical trial intended to support potential registration of momelotinib. We also announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation to momelotinib for the treatment of patients with intermediate/high-risk myelofibrosis who have previously received a JAK inhibitor.
 Following receipt of this clarity, we announced the design of the MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial in myelofibrosis, which we subsequently launched in the fourth quarter of 2019. MOMENTUM is a randomized double-blind trial designed to enroll 180 myelofibrosis patients who are symptomatic and anemic and have been treated previously with a JAK inhibitor. The Primary Endpoint of the trial is the Total Symptom Score (TSS) response rate of momelotinib compared to danazol at Week 24 (99% power; p-value < 0.05). Danazol has been selected as an appropriate treatment comparator given its use to ameliorate anemia in myelofibrosis patients, as recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines. Patients are being randomized 2:1 to receive either momelotinib or danazol. After 24 weeks of treatment, patients on danazol are being allowed to crossover to receive momelotinib.
 During the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported new analyses of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion data from SIMPLIFY-1, a double-blind Phase 3 trial of momelotinib head-to-head versus ruxolitinib in JAK inhibitor-naïve patients, which were presented in a poster by Dr. Ruben Mesa, Director of the Mays Cancer Center, home to UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center, at the 61st American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida. These analyses demonstrated that patients who received momelotinib had significantly decreased transfusion requirements compared to those treated with ruxolitinib, including an odds ratio of nearly 10 for receiving no transfusions during the 24-week study period. Transfusion dependency and moderate to severe anemia are critical negative prognostic factors for overall survival in myelofibrosis.

During the second quarter of 2020, at the 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Virtual Congress, we reported favorable Long-Term Safety and Dose Intensity data for momelotinib from more than 550 patients across the two previously conducted SIMPLIFY Phase 3 studies and their subsequent ongoing extended treatment periods. More than 90 SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2 patients continued to receive momelotinib for 3.5 years or longer. These data were presented in posters by Professor Claire Harrison, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom, and Dr. Vikas Gupta, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada. The key findings were:
  
• | Consistent with prior data, and reflecting momelotinib's differentiated pharmacological profile, our new long-term safety analyses continue to show a rapid and sustained increase in hemoglobin levels during momelotinib therapy, in contrast to the significant decrease in hemoglobin for patients receiving ruxolitinib. Patients treated with momelotinib also experienced significantly higher mean platelet counts compared to those receiving ruxolitinib. Importantly, patients who switched from ruxolitinib to momelotinib also achieved a sustained improvement in hemoglobin in both studies, and platelets in SIMPLIFY-1. In addition to an absence of significant rates of high-grade hematological toxicities, long-term tolerability was favorable with no new safety signals or evidence of cumulative toxicity.

• | Momelotinib's safety profile and durable benefits facilitated sustained dose intensity across the continuum of JAK inhibitor-naïve and previously JAK inhibitor treated myelofibrosis patients. While the starting doses for ruxolitinib were often attenuated due to low platelets, further reductions in dose intensity were also commonly required for ruxolitinib. In contrast, momelotinib was initiated at full dose for all subjects enrolled to the SIMPLIFY studies and high dose intensity was maintained in the majority over extended durations. Patients who switched from ruxolitinib to momelotinib saw an immediate and sustained improvement in dose intensity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The data from the two interrelated presentations suggest that the favorable effect on hemoglobin and platelets allows momelotinib to be initiated at full dose intensity and maintained for the majority of patients at full dose intensity over extended durations while retaining a favorable long-term safety profile. Notably, some patients continued to receive momelotinib 10 years after enrolling in the initial momelotinib Phase 2 trials while 90 Phase 3 SIMPLIFY patients who enrolled into those trials 4 to 6 years ago continued to receive momelotinib. We believe the dosing and safety profile may contribute to momelotinib’s potential ability to provide sustained benefits over extended durations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Most recently, we released updated analyses from the previously completed Phase 3 SIMPLIFY studies of momelotinib at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2020, including overall survival data as well as efficacy data for momelotinib compared to ruxolitinib in patients with low platelet levels. The overall survival data received an oral presentation by Dr. Srdan Verstovsek of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, USA; efficacy data by platelet strata were presented in a poster by Dr. Jean-Jacques Kiladjian, Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France. Key findings were:
  
• | Robust overall survival was observed in both JAK inhibitor-naïve and previously ruxolitinib treated patients. Sustained transfusion independence was observed with extended momelotinib treatment, and the median duration of TI in the momelotinib arm has not been reached after more than three years of follow up. We believe these data, in combination with previously reported safety data, further highlight where momelotinib may be a viable treatment option for myelofibrosis patients, including those who are not ideal candidates for currently approved therapies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The retrospective analysis of the two Phase 3 SIMPLIFY studies demonstrate that the relative benefit-risk profile of momelotinib and ruxolitinib is influenced by baseline platelet count. In SIMPLIFY-1, momelotinib achieved substantially higher Transfusion Independence (TI) and splenic response rates and had a similar symptomatic response relative to ruxolitinib in patients whose platelet count at baseline was <150 x 109/L. For patients whose platelet count was 150 – 300 x 109/L, momelotinib achieved a higher TI response rate and generally similar splenic and symptom response rates. In patients with platelet counts >300 x 109/L, ruxolitinib achieved higher splenic and symptom response rates than momelotinib, and the TI rate remained higher with momelotinib. These updated analyses complement previous findings that demonstrate the ability to initiate and maintain near-maximal momelotinib dose intensity regardless of baseline platelet count, suggesting that this durable dosing contributes to its efficacy profile.

During 2020, we continued to operationalize the MOMENTUM trial on a global basis, and we anticipate closing screening in the first half of 2021 and remain on track to complete enrollment in mid-2021. Top-line data are currently anticipated in the first half of 2022 and, if the data are positive, we anticipate filing for regulatory approval of momelotinib in the second half of 2022. Due to the recent global outbreak of COVID-19, our clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected, and we are likely to experience delays in anticipated timelines and milestones, which will be difficult to predict until we have more visibility on the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential institution of additional public health orders. We have experienced and may continue to experience some delays in planned site initiations and activations and may experience future delays in overall enrollment. 
 We believe that our current resources will be sufficient to execute on our development strategy for momelotinib into the second half of 2022, subject to the potential impact of COVID-19. We are also starting to explore non-dilutive options that could provide additional capital to support our North American commercialization strategy. 
 Our portfolio also includes SRA737, a selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), an emerging target for the treatment of cancer which has a key role in the DNA Damage Response (DDR). In November 2020, we entered into an amendment to the License Agreement with CRT Pioneer Fund (CPF) to allow for the potential future clinical development of SRA737. 
 We wholly own momelotinib, subject to future milestone payments and royalties, and retain the global commercialization rights to SRA737.
 Our Lead Product Candidate – Momelotinib
 Myelofibrosis
 Myelofibrosis is a disorder involving the stem-cells that give rise to blood cells, and is driven by molecular abnormalities that activate the JAK-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. The Janus kinases (JAKs) play a central role in the regulation of blood cell production, controlling survival, proliferation, and differentiation of progenitor cells as well as the function of mature cells. Abnormal activation of the JAK‑STAT pathway is central to the development of myelofibrosis by driving proliferation, inflammation, fibrosis, and progression of disease.
 The three cardinal disease manifestations of myelofibrosis are (1) progressive anemia, often in association with thrombocytopenia (deficiency of platelets in the blood) or other cytopenias (blood cell deficiencies); (2) constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats, fever, cachexia (wasting), bone pain, pruritus (itching), and weight loss; and (3) organ enlargement, principally of the spleen and less often the liver, due to these organs attempting to produce blood cells, which can cause commonly associated symptoms such as abdominal distension and pain, early satiety, dyspnea (labored breathing), and diarrhea. The median survival for all patients with myelofibrosis is about six years but is considerably worse for intermediate 2- and high-risk patients at 4 years and 2.25 years, respectively. Besides causing disease-related morbidity, myelofibrosis may result in early death from leukemic progression, which can occur in about 20% of patients, and complications arising from progressive bone marrow failure, portal or pulmonary hypertension, infections, clotting, bleeding, and cardiovascular complications.
 Myelofibrosis is a relatively rare condition with an incidence of 0.1 to 1 per 100,000 individuals per year, and a prevalence of 6 per 100,000 person-years because of its chronic nature and disabling course. It is estimated that 18,000 patients are living with myelofibrosis in the United States, and there are up to 40,000 patients globally. Median age at diagnosis is 67 years. Myelofibrosis may occur de novo as primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or may arise from a preexisting myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), including primarily polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocytosis (ET).

Importance of Anemia in Myelofibrosis
 Anemia is a cardinal feature of myelofibrosis, and RBC transfusion dependence is a hallmark of the late-stage disease. Within a year of diagnosis, 45% of patients with myelofibrosis are already RBC transfusion dependent and eventually, nearly all will develop transfusion dependence.
 Transfusion dependence is a critical negative prognostic factor for survival for patients with myelofibrosis. Transfusions are associated with both acute and chronic health risks, and they place a significant burden on both the patient and the health care system. Severe anemia and transfusion dependence are independent predictors of poor prognosis and are inversely correlated with quality of life. Conversely, response to anemia-targeted therapies has been associated with improvement in quality of life. The prognostic effect of anemia was recently demonstrated in 1,109 consecutive PMF patients at the Mayo Clinic, 86% of whom presented with some degree of anemia. Even mild anemia impaired survival, while severe anemia (defined as Hgb level of < 8 g/dL or transfusion dependence) was associated with > 1.5-fold increase in risk of death compared with moderate anemia (Hgb level of 8-10 g/dL).
 Existing approaches for the management of myelofibrosis associated anemia include transfusion, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with low erythropoietin levels, corticosteroids, androgens (including danazol), immunomodulators, and splenectomy. Each of these treatments is described by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) as minimally effective.
 Momelotinib – A Potent and Selective JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 Inhibitor
 Momelotinib is a potent, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1, under development for treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. Momelotinib was discovered by Cytopia Research, which commenced an initial Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States in 2009. Cytopia was acquired by YM BioSciences, Inc. in 2010, which continued clinical development of the compound, before its own acquisition by Gilead in 2013. Amongst other clinical studies, Gilead conducted two registration-track Phase 3 trials in subjects with myelofibrosis, GS-US-352-0101 (SIMPLIFY-1) and GS-US-352-1214 (SIMPLIFY-2). In August 2018, we acquired the momelotinib program from Gilead and assumed the role of IND sponsor in September 2018 with the intent to continue development of momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Several members of our senior management team were previously executives at Cytopia and/or YM BioSciences and led the early development of momelotinib.
 Following our acquisition of the program, we conducted a comprehensive review of data from the two Phase 3 trials of momelotinib, versus ruxolitinib (SIMPLIFY-1) and best available therapy (BAT) (SIMPLIFY-2), as well as GS-US-352-1672, a Phase 2, open-label, translational biology trial of momelotinib in transfusion-dependent subjects with myelofibrosis. In aggregate, our analyses across a variety of datasets show consistent benefit in the three cardinal disease manifestations of myelofibrosis across a spectrum of intermediate-high risk patients with myelofibrosis, both JAK inhibitor-naïve and previously JAK inhibitor-exposed: namely, (1) anemia and transfusion dependency, (2) constitutional symptoms, and (3) enlarged spleen, consistent with the compound’s differentiated inhibition of JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1. Although SIMPLIFY-1 met its primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior spleen volume reduction, it did not meet its key secondary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior reduction in total symptom score; and although SIMPLIFY-2 did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of superior reduction in spleen volume, it did meet its key secondary efficacy endpoint of superior reduction in total symptom score. In both SIMPLIFY studies, additional secondary endpoints related to transfusion independence rate, transfusion dependence rate, and rate of red blood cell transfusions all favored momelotinib over control and supported the potential for momelotinib to provide meaningful anemia benefits. As such, we have determined that there is substantial clinical justification for further development of momelotinib.
 Among the JAK-inhibitor class, momelotinib uniquely inhibits JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1. All three targets contribute to disease manifestations of myelofibrosis in complex and overlapping ways. The dominant roles for each in driving the various disease manifestations include: JAK1, abnormal cytokine production and immune dysregulation; JAK2, clonal myeloid proliferation; and ACVR1, anemia. Evidence suggests that momelotinib can provide an array of differentiated and compelling anemia-related clinical benefits, while also providing symptomatic and splenic benefits clinically comparable to the approved standard-of-care, ruxolitinib. Specifically, via inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2, momelotinib is uniquely positioned as the only JAK-inhibitor demonstrated to provide comparable splenic benefit when compared directly to ruxolitinib in the JAK inhibitor treatment-naïve setting, while Phase 3 data strongly suggest the potential for momelotinib to provide substantial symptom benefit for both JAK-inhibitor treatment-naïve and exposed patients with myelofibrosis. In addition, momelotinib induces robust, clinically meaningful and consistent anemia benefits, likely via inhibition of ACVR1 and JAK1, as demonstrated in the two momelotinib Phase 3 trials and in the Phase 2 translational biology trial (GS-US-352-1672) in transfusion-dependent patients.

Myelofibrosis-associated anemia is dependent on a number of factors and involves the hyperactivation of two parallel signal transduction pathways that drive production of the peptide hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron metabolism, and elevated levels in myelofibrosis perturbs iron homeostasis and exacerbates anemia. The principle pathway directing hepcidin expression involves activation of ACVR1, whereas a secondary pathway increases hepcidin in response to inflammation and JAK-STAT signaling. Momelotinib directly inhibits ACVR1, JAK1 and JAK2 to effectively limit hepcidin production. This unique profile induces a dose-dependent decrease in serum hepcidin, restoring iron homeostasis and alleviating anemia. 
 In a nonclinical anemia model, momelotinib treatment increased circulating plasma iron, RBC production, and Hgb levels consistent with the observed reduction in inflammatory cytokine and hepcidin levels associated with inhibition of JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1.This effect of momelotinib was further validated by data from trial GS-US-352-1672 in an advanced, transfusion-dependent myelofibrosis population in which 34% and 39% of patients achieved transfusion independence for at least 12 and 8 weeks, respectively. Median plasma hepcidin levels declined acutely after momelotinib dosing and chronically over the entire 24-week dosing period, suggesting momelotinib induced a sustained reduction of both predose (basal) and postdose levels of hepcidin. In an exploratory post-hoc analysis, a substantial reduction in transfusion frequency was also observed in subjects who did not achieve complete transfusion independence.
 Similarly, substantially higher rates of transfusion independence and lower rates of transfusion dependency were observed in momelotinib-treated subjects compared with ruxolitinib or BAT-treated subjects in the SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2 pivotal trials.  In an exploratory aggregate analysis including 152 transfusion dependent patients treated with momelotinib across the SIMPLIFY-1, SIMPLIFY-2, and GS-US-352-1672 trials, the combined 8- and 12-week transfusion independence response rates across this continuum of JAK-inhibitor-naïve and exposed, intermediate- and high-risk myelofibrosis patients, were 48.7% and 44.1%, respectively. The rate of transfusion independence in transfusion-dependent subjects, along with other anemia benefits, were broadly consistent across these trials, and are consistent with the empirical findings of a pronounced anemia benefit observed in initial Phase 1/2 momelotinib clinical studies. 
 In addition, there is extensive evidence of momelotinib’s sustained positive effects on hemoglobin (Hgb) and other anemia endpoints. A robust and long-lasting increase in Hgb was observed in the GS-US-352-1672 trial, which enrolled only transfusion-dependent subjects. A similar observation was noted in the JAK inhibitor-naïve SIMPLIFY-1 trial, where a rapid and sustained increase in Hgb was observed in subjects randomized to momelotinib, which contrasted with the acute and profound reduction in Hgb by treatment with the standard-of-care, ruxolitinib. Notably, subjects who crossed over to momelotinib treatment following 24 weeks of ruxolitinib therapy experienced a rapid and substantive increase in Hgb, ultimately achieving sustained Hgb levels that exceeded those observed in the pretreatment baseline period.
 In totality, over 1,200 subjects have been treated with momelotinib across more than 20 clinical studies, with over 820 myelofibrosis patients treated to date. Uniquely among the JAK inhibitor class, this substantive body of clinical data has demonstrated consistent and reproducible therapeutic benefits for momelotinib across all three hallmarks of myelofibrosis, anemia, enlarged spleen and symptoms. In general, momelotinib has proven to be generally well tolerated, with certain patients having received continuous daily dosing of momelotinib for more than 10 years, indicative of momelotinib’s potential to provide long-term tolerability and sustained benefit. In the randomized phases of SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2, the most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events for subjects treated with momelotinib were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, headache, asthenia and nausea. The most commonly reported Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were anemia, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, pneumonia and cardiac failure. These SAEs include events assessed as both related and unrelated to momelotinib and each occurred in < 4% of subjects.
 Momelotinib – Next Steps
 During the fourth quarter of 2019, we launched the MOMENTUM clinical trial for patients with myelofibrosis. The randomized double-blind global Phase 3 trial is designed to confirm the efficacy of momelotinib on myelofibrosis symptoms, transfusion independence and splenomegaly, as compared to danazol. The trial is targeting enrollment of 180 myelofibrosis patients who are symptomatic, anemic and have been treated previously with a JAK inhibitor. We anticipate reporting top-line data from the trial in the first half of 2022. Data from MOMENTUM, along with data from more than 820 myelofibrosis patients previously treated with momelotinib, will form the basis of the global registration strategy for momelotinib.

Our DDR Candidate – SRA737 
 SRA737, a Potent, Highly Selective, Orally Bioavailable Chk1 Inhibitor
 SRA737 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1, an emerging target for the treatment of cancer which has a key role in the DNA Damage Response. SRA737 was investigated in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials that were initiated in the third quarter of 2016 in the United Kingdom under a Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA). SRA737 was licensed to us in September 2016 and in January 2017, we successfully transferred sponsorship of the trials to Sierra.
Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a serine-threonine kinase and master regulator of cell cycle progression and the DNA Damage Response (DDR) replication stress response. One of the hallmarks of cancer is genomic instability.  A major source of genomic instability in certain tumors arises as a consequence of dysregulated cell cycle checkpoints and aberrant DNA replication, resulting in high replication stress (RS), which is manifested by stalled replication forks and associated DNA damage. Chk1 regulates multiple cell-cycle phases, temporarily inhibiting the progression of cell replication and division in order to ensure proper replication of the genome and repair of collapsed or damaged replication forks.  Chk1 stabilizes stalled replication forks, manages origin firing to avoid further replication stress, and mediates DNA repair via homologous recombination in the event of fork collapse.  Tumors with high RS become reliant on Chk1 to mitigate the potentially catastrophic consequences of excess genomic instability. As such, Chk1 represents a promising therapeutic target in cancers with high RS, as inhibiting Chk1 drives excessive genomic instability which can result in replication catastrophe and tumor cell death.
 During the second quarter of 2019, we reported preliminary efficacy and safety data from these two trials at the 2019 ASCO Annual meeting. We also announced plans to prioritize our resources on the development of momelotinib and that we would be launching a campaign exploring non-dilutive strategic options to support any future continued development of SRA737. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced an amendment to the license agreement with CPF to allow for the potential future clinical development of SRA737.
 SRA737-01 Phase 1/2 Monotherapy Trial
 This signal-seeking Phase 1/2 study (NCT02797964) was designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of continuous, oral daily dosing of SRA737, as well as to survey a broad range of cancer indications and genetic contexts in the expansion phase, in order to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity and delineate potential genetic signatures and/or tumor indications that might warrant additional therapeutic investigation.
 At the 2019 ASCO Annual meeting, we reported preliminary efficacy and safety data from this trial. Evidence of anti-tumor activity was observed in subjects with high grade serous ovarian carcinomas, colorectal, prostate and non-small cell lung cancers; no RECIST partial responses or complete responses were confirmed, but several noteworthy tumor reductions were recorded.
 SRA737-02 Phase 1/2 Low-Dose Gemcitabine Combination Trial
 Extensive preclinical data, as well as emerging clinical data, support the synergistic interaction between Chk1 inhibition and gemcitabine.  Gemcitabine profoundly depletes DNA replication building blocks, and targets proliferating cells by inducing replication stress through induction of stalled replication forks and double-strand breaks.  Low concentrations of gemcitabine cause a prolonged cell cycle S-phase and induce hallmarks of replication stress without inducing overt cytotoxicity. The critical role of Chk1 in mediating cellular responses to replication stress affords the opportunity to combine SRA737 with sub-therapeutic concentrations of the replication stress-inducing agent gemcitabine.  
 This signal-seeking Phase 1/2 study (NCT02797977) was designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of SRA737 in combination with sub-therapeutic, low dose gemcitabine (LDG), as well as to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of SRA737 potentiated by LDG in tumors with genetic alterations predicted to confer increased intrinsic RS and Chk1i sensitivity. Relative to standard-of-care, gemcitabine doses tested were approximately 10-25% of a standard chemotherapeutic dose.

At the 2019 ASCO Annual meeting, we reported preliminary efficacy and safety data from this trial. Overall, Partial Responses were observed in six subjects and 41 subjects had a best response of Stable Disease (SD); durable SD lasting ≥ 4 months was recorded in 32 subjects and was observed in all expansion cohorts. The combination of SRA737+LDG was generally well tolerated. Following ASCO 2019, we announced plans to prioritize our resources on the development of momelotinib and that we would be launching a campaign exploring non-dilutive strategic options to support any future continued development of SRA737. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced an amendment to the license agreement with CPF to allow for the potential future clinical development of SRA737.

 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for momelotinib and SRA737 and future product candidates, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our strategy is to seek to protect our proprietary position and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing patent applications related to our proprietary technology and product candidates in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position.
 We have acquired all rights to patent portfolios directed to compositions of matter and methods of use related to momelotinib and other JAK 1/2 and ACVR1 inhibitors. As of December 31, 2020, these rights included three issued U.S. patents comprising claims directed to compositions and analogs of momelotinib and methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrotic indications as a single agent. Two of these patents will expire in 2028 while the third patent will expire in 2030, absent any extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also include 53 issued foreign patents and one pending foreign patent application in 48 jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, several countries in Europe, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia and others comprising claims directed to compositions of momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrotic indications as a single agent. These foreign patents, and any patent issuing from the pending foreign patent application, are expected to expire in 2028, absent any extension. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one issued U.S. utility patent and one reissued U.S. utility patent, and one pending reissue application comprising claims directed to different polymorph and salt forms of momelotinib, and methods of their use for the treatment of myelofibrotic indications. These patents will expire in 2035, absent any extension. Note that for issued U.S. patents, up to five years of patent term extension is available for a single patent directed to the composition of momelotinib, bringing the possible patent exclusivity in the U.S. out to 2040. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included 46 issued foreign patents, and 14 pending foreign patent applications in 52 jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, several countries in Europe, Hong-Kong, India, Israel, New Zealand, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan comprising claims directed to different polymorph and salt forms of momelotinib. These foreign patents, and any patent issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2035, absent any extension. Note that for issued European patents, up to five years of term extension is available via a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) for a single patent directed to the composition of momelotinib, bringing the possible patent exclusivity in Europe out to 2040. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included four issued foreign patents in four jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa comprising claims directed to methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of anemia. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one issued U.S. patent comprising claims directed to methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of ACVR1-mediated diseases. This U.S. patent will expire in 2037, absent any extensions. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application, and two foreign pending application comprising claims directed to platelet count-agnostic methods of using momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis. We have filed and will continue to file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of momelotinib as they develop.

We have exclusively licensed CPF’s rights to patents owned by Cancer Research Technology (CPF), a subsidiary of Cancer Research UK (CRUK), directed to compositions of matter and methods of use related to SRA737 and other Chk1 inhibitors. As of December 31, 2020, these rights included two issued U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent application comprising claims directed to compositions of SRA737 and methods of using SRA737 for the treatment of cancer indications as a single agent, or in combination with a DNA damaging agent. The two issued U.S. patents and any patents issuing from the pending U.S. utility application are expected to expire in 2033, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included 27 issued foreign patents and 6 pending foreign patent applications in 27 foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe and Japan comprising claims directed to compositions of SRA737 and methods of using SRA737 for the treatment of cancer indications as a single agent, or in combination with a DNA damaging agent. These foreign patents, and any patents issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2033, absent any extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included, one pending U.S. application and 4 pending foreign applications comprising claims directed to biomarkers and patient selection when using SRA737 to treat cancer indications. Any patents issuing from these pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2038, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending U.S. application and 8 pending foreign applications comprising claims directed to methods of using SRA737 in combination with PARP inhibitors for inhibiting tumor reduction. Any patents issuing from these pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2038, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending U.S. application and 7 pending foreign applications comprising claims directed to methods of using SRA737 as a monotherapy or in combination therapy to treat cancer indications. Any patents issuing from these pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2039, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application filed by the Company and The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center comprising claims directed to methods of using SRA737 to treat cancer indications. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, these rights also included one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application comprising claims directed to methods of using SRA737 in the treatment of cancer associated with an intermediate mutational burden (TMB), or genetic abnormality in one or more particular genes associated with replicative stress. We have filed and will continue to file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of SRA737 as they develop. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or other foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product candidate and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. 
 As with other oncology companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Our issued patents and any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before momelotinib and SRA737 or any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
 11

In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our scientific advisors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with a third party. 
 Competition 
 The hematology and oncology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies that are available for the indication or indications for which they are approved and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 To our knowledge, there are currently two approved myelofibrosis drugs that specifically rely on JAK inhibition, ruxolitinib, marketed by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi® in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi in the rest of the world and fedratinib, marketed by Celgene Corporation as Inrebic® in the United States. Fedratinib was also recently approved in Europe. In addition, there is one additional JAK inhibitor competitor in clinical development, at a similar state of development or more advanced than us. CTI Biopharma Corporation is developing pacritinib, for a subset of myelofibrosis patients with platelet counts less than 50,000/uL commenced its rolling NDA submission in October 2020. However, to our knowledge, there are no drugs that target JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 on the market, nor in development. Other competitors developing myelofibrosis therapeutics include Acceleron, Constellation Pharma, AbbVie, Kartos and Incyte. Celgene and Acceleron are developing luspatercept in a Phase 3 clinical trial for myelofibrosis. Constellation Pharma is developing pelabresib (CPI-0610), a BET inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical trial in combiniation with ruxolitinib. AbbVie announced two Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with ruxolitinib for JAKi naïve and previously JAKi treated patients. Kartos announced clinical trial plans for KRT-232, a MDM2 inhibitor for JAKi relapsed or refractory MF patients. Incyte launched Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate parsaclisib, in combination with ruxolitinib. In addition, there are several Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials being conducted in myelofibrosis by various companies, including a Phase 2 study of a deuterated form of momelotinib being run by Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals in China. Several additional companies are advancing assets in the early stages of development potentially for the myelofibrosis market. If momelotinib is approved, it will compete with existing therapies for the indication or indications for which it is approved. While we believe that momelotinib may have the ability to provide an anemia benefit in addition to treating the other manifestations of myelofibrosis, which we believe is unique within the JAK inhibitor class of agents, the market for momelotinib is competitive, and physicians and other prescribers may not recommend or prescribe momelotinib over other competing products.
To our knowledge, there are no approved drugs that specifically target Chk1 on the market, but there are a number of competitors in clinical development, at a similar stage of development or more advanced than us. To our knowledge, Esperas Pharma is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of an oral Chk1 inhibitor as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. There are also preclinical programs focused on developing Chk1 inhibitors. If SRA737 is approved, it will compete with existing therapies and currently marketed drugs for the indication or indications for which it is approved.
 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the hematology and oncology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs. 
 12

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture and supply of preclinical study and clinical trial materials in relation to our lead product candidate, momelotinib, including materials for any combination trials that we may undertake, and any future potential product candidates that we may develop for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if momelotinib receives marketing approval. 
 We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. We believe that our manufacturers have sufficient capacity to meet our current demand and, in the event that they fail to meet our demand, adequate alternative sources for such materials exist. However, there is a risk that if supplies are interrupted or result in poor yield or quality, it would materially harm our business. We will continue to evaluate product demand requirements and qualify alternate sources for momelotinib, and our other product candidates on an as-needed basis. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations are required to comply with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations, which are regulatory requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans. 
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, consent decrees, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil or criminal penalties, and criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13

 
• | approval by an independent IRB ethics committee, either centralized or with respect to each clinical site, before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for substantive review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices (GLPs). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to eligible human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
  The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) for approval. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove research. IRB review serves an important role in the protection of the rights and welfare of human 
 14

research subjects. Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which may review data and endpoints at designated check points, make recommendations and/or halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Further, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, the FDA has issued guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including certain reporting requirements, and additional guidance on the good manufacturing practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection and other topics. We may be required to make further adjustments to our clinical trials or business operations based on current or future guidance and regulatory requirements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 15

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development nonclinical and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in a Complete Response Letter and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter to the FDA satisfaction, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug, and typically require substantial documentation and communication with the FDA. 
 16

Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 Pediatric Information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted; however, beginning in 2020, PREA will apply to NDAs for orphan-designated drugs if the drug is molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. With regard to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. 
 In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.  Accelerated approval or Fast Track programs do not reduce the amount of clinical data necessary to establish the drug is both safe and effective or the standards for approval.
 17

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. We previously announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation to momelotinib for the treatment of patients with intermediate/high-risk myelofibrosis who have previously received a JAK inhibitor. Even if a product qualifies for Fast Track designation or any of these other programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may continue to explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling changes, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------

 18

 
• | clinical holds on post-approval or Phase IV clinical studies, if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products. A company can only promote the indications that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. In many cases, physicians view such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the 
 19

applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 Marketing Exclusivity and Patent Term Extension 
 Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission and approval of certain marketing applications for products containing the same active ingredient. Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which FDA cannot approval an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent term extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue testing and review with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from NDA approval. For patents that might expire during the review phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. Up to five years of patent term extension is potentially available for a single US issued patent directed to the momelotinib composition of matter upon NDA approval. We have acquired patent rights including two issued U.S. utility patents and one pending reissue application comprising claims directed to a polymorph and salt form of momelotinib. These patents will expire in 2035, absent any extension. If five years of patent term extension is applied to one of these patents, the patent exclusivity for momelotinib in the U.S. would extend to either 2040 or the maximum allowable 14-year limit from NDA approval, whichever is sooner. 
 During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (505(b)(2) NDA), submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 20

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products that we are developing are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with applicable health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, Stark law, and implementing regulations, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Other laws and regulations that may apply to prescription drug manufacturers include the Sunshine Act, prescription drug price reporting requirements, and various state transparency and reporting laws. All business activities of prescription drug manufacturers are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (PPACA) amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and any referral source on the other, including prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests, and service fees, unless expressly exempted or protected by a safe harbor. Further, the statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where one purpose of the remuneration was to obtain remuneration in exchange for referral or to induce further referrals for an item or service. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria of an applicable safe harbor for protection from liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by PPACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that the government does not need to prove that a person had the intent to specifically violate the statute in order to find a violation. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not expressly provide for certain safe harbors or impose different requirements for safe harbor protection under applicable state laws.
 21

The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted or cause to be submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare billing numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label), and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, provincial, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including jurisdictions in which we conduct our clinical trials. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors, service providers or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires applicable manufacturers and certain distributors of prescription drugs, among other products, that are available for coverage by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third-party as directed by that entity, to covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; and (ii) physician ownership (including immediate family ownership) and investment interests in the entity. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting and transparency requirements will extend to include payments and transfers of value made during the previous year to certain non-physician covered recipients, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. There are also an increasing number of state and local “sunshine” or transparency and reporting laws that require applicable manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. The U.S. federal government discloses the reported information on a publicly available website. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. These federal, state, and local laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 22

Because of the breadth of these health care laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and corporate integrity agreement, which impose certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country or if we contract with vendors or independent contractors outside of the U.S., we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-approval requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-corruption/anti-bribery laws, anti-kickback laws, healthcare fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. While we are not aware of any current issues, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under applicable healthcare laws, or the impact of such actions on our business. However, the costs of defending such actions or claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of pharmaceutical products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Third-party payers may attempt to control costs by limiting coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, and by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. 
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Some third-party payers also require pre-approval or prior authorization of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who prescribe such therapies or patients who use such prescription drugs. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 23

In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
 Enacted in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, or PPACA, is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, PPACA revises the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. For example, in November 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. In December 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. PPACA, as well as other legislation and regulations, may continue to place downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. These new laws may result in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
 There have been judicial and Congressional challenges and amendments to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future, including the potential repeal of all or part of PPACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. 
 24

There have been legislative and judicial efforts to repeal, replace, or change some or all of the ACA, including measures taken during the Trump administration. The Tax Reform Act, among other things, included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision that held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. It is uncertain how the United States Supreme Court will rule on this case or how healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA and our business. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans and the medical device excise tax, and effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, also amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, effective January 1, 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.  
 Further, there have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increased patient access to lower cost generic and biosimilar drugs. In particular, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. The FDA also released a final rule in September 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, in November 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The CMS also issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. In December 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. It is unclear to what extent these new regulations will be implemented and to what extent these or any future legislation or regulation by the Biden administration will have on our business, including our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability. We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved.
 Our business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals 
 25

are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently the SEC and the Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing, among other things, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drugs, and reimbursement requirements. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. 
 In the European Union, Member States require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure or national procedure. An additional route (mutual recognition procedure) is based on the recognition of granted marketing authorizations by one or more EU countries. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of medicines, including human medicines containing new active substances to treat cancer. 
 We would be subject to the centralized authorization procedure, which provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (who, together with the European Union Member States) are members of the European Economic Area (EEA). Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. By law, a company can only start to market a medicine once it has received a marketing authorization. 
 The UK is no longer a member of the EU, but EU law remains applicable in Northern Ireland.  There are a number of new marketing authorization routes available in the UK, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) or Northern Ireland, in addition to the national procedure. As with the EU position, a company can only start to market a medicine in the UK once it has received a marketing authorization.
 European Regulation of Clinical Trials and Grant of Marketing Authorization
 Pharmaceutical products in the European Union are subject to regulation under comprehensive legislation enacted by the European Commission in the European Medicinal Products Directive (Directive 2001/83/EC), as amended. Centrally authorized products are also regulated by Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004. This legislation is binding on all Member States together with ancillary legislation governing research. In the UK, the main legislative texts relating to human medicines is the Medicines Act 1968 and the Human Medicines Regulation 2012.
 26

Clinical Trial Authorization
 Clinical trials in the European Union are regulated under European Council Directive 2001/20/EC (Clinical Trials Directive) on the implementation of GCP in the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products for human use. The Clinical Trials Directive requires the sponsor of an investigational medicinal product to obtain a CTA, much like an IND in the United States, from the national competent authority of a European Union Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. The application for CTA must satisfy detailed requirements for the protection of trial subjects including requirements relating to consent and specific rules for minors and adults unable to consent by reason of incapacity. The CTA application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the Council Directive and corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance, including the European Commission Communication 2010/C 82/01. A clinical trial may only be commenced after an Ethics Committee has given its approval. 
 A sponsor of a clinical trial must also follow certain procedures, including obtaining a unique EudraCT number by entering specified relevant information in the EudraCT Community Clinical Trial System. In addition, Member States require that the manufacture and/or importation of investigational medicinal products be authorized. Sponsors of investigational medicinal products must ensure compliance with, among other things, GCP and good manufacturing practice (GMP) as well as requirements pertaining to safety reporting. 
 In April 2014, Regulation EU No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted to replace the Clinical Trials Directive. The Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify the current rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance. For instance, there will be a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, a European Union portal and database. The implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation depends on confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) through an independent audit, which commenced in September 2020. The system is currently planned to go live in December 2021. The new clinical trial portal and database will be maintained by the EMA in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Union Member States. The objectives of the new Regulation include consistent rules for conducting trials throughout the European Union, consistent data standards and adverse events listing, and consistent information on the authorization status. Additionally, information on the conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the European Union will be made publicly available.
 The main legislation that applies to clinical trials in the UK is the UK Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, which transposes the Clinical Trials Directive into domestic law.  Consequently, the requirements and obligations that relate to the conduct of clinical trials in the UK currently remain largely aligned with the EU position.  A CTA will be required to conduct a clinical trial in the UK, together with Ethics Committee approval.  However, the sponsor of a clinical trial in the UK must be established in the UK or a country on an approved list (currently limited to the EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) or appoint a legal representative who is established on one of the aforementioned countries. Clinical trials should also be registered on an established international register such as ISRCTN registry or ClinicalTrials.gov.  The UK also requires the manufacture and/or importation of investigational medicinal products to be authorised.  There is no mutual recognition agreement between the UK and EU on GMP, so medicines manufactured in the UK would be subject to GMP release in the EU. 
 Procedural Routes for Marketing Authorization in the European Union and UK
 The European Union system for authorization of medicinal products for human use offers several routes: the centralized procedure, the decentralized procedure, and the mutual recognition procedure, as well as domestic national routes. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union Member States as well as the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain categories of investigational products, including human products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer, AIDS, diabetes and neurodegenerative illness; orphan medicinal products; and medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes. Applications for marketing authorization for such medicines must be submitted to the EMA, in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is generally responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. 
 27

The decentralized and mutual recognition procedures are applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products and are both based on the principle of recognition of a marketing authorization by one or more Member States. The decentralized procedure is available for applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union Member States where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union Member State before. In this procedure, an application for marketing authorization is submitted simultaneously in several Member States, one of them being chosen as the “Reference Member State.” At the end of the procedure, national marketing authorizations are granted in the Reference and in the concerned Member States. The mutual recognition procedure is compulsory when a medicinal product has already received a marketing authorization in one Member State and is to be marketed in a Member State other than that in which it was first authorized. Any national marketing authorization granted by a European Union Member State's national authority can be used to support an application for its mutual recognition by other Member States. Marketing authorization applications can also be submitted directly to the Member State's national competent authority under the national route (if the centralized route is not compulsory).  There are now multiple routes to obtain a marketing authorization in the UK, Great Britain or Northern Ireland, which are broadly categorized as either (1) national routes (i.e.  the innovative licensing and access procedure (ILAP), the national procedure, rolling review, EC Decision Procedure (ECDP), the MR/DC reliance procedure and unfettered access from Northern Ireland); or (2) international routes (i.e. Access Consortium to market a medicine in the UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore and/or Switzerland; or the Project Orbis program for cancer treatments). The application procedure will depend on the relevant procedure chosen.
 All granted centrally authorized marketing authorizations automatically became Great Britain (GB) marketing authorizations on 1 January 2021. Though there are several ways to obtain a marketing authorization for GB (and Northern Ireland) discussed above, the EDRCP is available for marketing authorizations approved under the centralized procedure. Under this procedure the UK's regulator, the MHRA, can rely on the decision of the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization under centralized procedure for a period of two years from 1 January 2021 when determining an application for a GB marketing authorization. Applicants submit a letter of intent to submit an EDRCP to the MHRA at least 4 weeks before the submission of the application for the EDRCP marketing authorization application.  The marketing authorization application is submitted after receipt of the positive opinion from the CHMP. 
 Standard for Approval of a Marketing Authorization in the European Union and UK
 The objective of the EMA is the comprehensive evaluation of benefit/risk profile of a new medicinal product going through the centralized procedure. This evaluation involves showing that the product has significant efficacy and safety, together with a satisfactory plan for risk management post-marketing. The CHMP is the EMA’s expert committee responsible for human medicinal products. The CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial review of centrally authorized marketing authorization applications and for assessing modifications or extensions (variations) to an existing marketing authorization. It also considers the recommendations of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee on the safety of medicines on the market and when necessary, recommends to the European Commission changes to a medicine’s marketing authorization, or its suspension or withdrawal from the market. The marketing authorization application is similar to the NDA in the United States. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document (CTD), which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and non-clinical and clinical trial information. The main scientific principle used by the CHMP in the evaluation of medicinal products is the benefit/risk ratio based on quality, efficacy, safety, and risk management considerations. The CHMP assesses whether the data it reviews comply with the ICH-harmonized Good Practices published for GCP, GMP and good laboratory practice (GLP). The CHMP also considers whether studies concluding efficacy and safety of products have sufficient statistical power.
 Marketing authorizations for the UK are submitted to the MHRA.  As the Medicinal Products Directive is transposed into domestic law, the standards of clinical efficacy, safety, chemical control and manufacture as at 31 December 2020 (the end of the transition period for the UK’s exit from the EU) are retained.  As Northern Ireland continues to apply EU law, medicines regulation for Great Britain is likely to be closely aligned with the EU for some time.

Other Regulatory Issues
 An exemption to the rule requiring marketing authorization permits Member States of the European Union (and the UK) to make a product available for compassionate use to patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered life threatening, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product. The medicinal product concerned must be undergoing clinical trials or the subject of application for marketing authorization.
 Quality of the medicinal products in question is governed by the GMP Directives. These lay down the legal framework for GMP for both marketed medicinal products and investigational products in clinical trials. The Directive obliges manufacturers to comply with GMP for an effective pharmaceutical quality assurance, quality control, systems for recording and reviewing complaints and a system for prompt recall of products in the distribution network. With regards to post–marketing safety of newly authorized products, the EMA monitors and supervises the safety of medicines that have been authorized in the EU to ensure their benefits outweigh their risks. Volume 4 of EudraLex published by the European Commission provides GMP guidelines used to interpret the principles of GMP laid down in the GMP Directives..  
 The pharmacovigilance legislation imposes a duty on Member States to collect information on the risks of products with regards to patients’ or public health. That information must refer to adverse events arising from the use of the medicinal product within the terms of the marketing authorization as well as use outside the authorized indication and use associated with occupational exposure.
 There is a similar obligation on the marketing authorization holder (MAH) to operate a robust pharmacovigilance system equivalent to that of the relevant Member State. The MAH must evaluate all safety and effectiveness information scientifically, consider the options for risk minimization and take appropriate measures as necessary. As part of the pharmacovigilance system, the MAH must have permanently and continuously an appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance, maintain a pharmacovigilance master file, operate a risk management system for each medicinal product, monitor the outcome of risk minimization measures contained in the risk management program and continually update the risk management system and monitor the pharmacovigilance system to determine whether there are new risks or changes to the risk-benefit profile of the product(s).
Two recent developments have been introduced which further expand the European regulatory framework: the Falsified Medicines Directive and the Pharmacovigilance Directive. The Falsified Medicines Directive obliges manufacturers of medicinal products to audit their suppliers of active substances to ensure compliance with GMP. It also introduces a new obligation on product manufacturers to inform the competent authority (e.g., ANSM) and the marketing authorization holder if they become aware that these products may be falsified, whether they are being distributed through the legitimate supply chain or by illegal means. The Pharmacovigilance Directive obliges marketing authorization holders to monitor the safety of authorized products and detect any change in their risk-benefit profile. A new pan-European clinical trial data information database has been created that will be complementary to the database established for pharmacovigilance (Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with respect to centrally authorized medicinal products).  In addition, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 outlines the practical implications for marketing authorization holders, national competent authorities, and the EMA. Also, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 on post-authorization efficacy studies specifies the situations in which such studies may be required. Post-authorization efficacy studies may be required where concerns relating to some aspects of efficacy of the medicinal product are identified and can be resolved only after the medicinal product has been marketed, or where the understanding of the disease, the clinical methodology or the use of the medicinal product under real-life conditions indicate that previous efficacy evaluations might have to be revised significantly. Brexit will disrupt the operation of pre- and post-authorization clinical trial infrastructure. The rules around GMP and pharmacovigilance in the UK currently remain similar to the EU requirements.  However, the Falsified Medicines Directive will not apply in Great Britain though it is likely that the UK will implement a procedure to minimise the risk of falsified medicines.  
 29

In addition, in May 2016, the EU formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which applies to all EU member states from May 25, 2018 and replaced the European Union Data Protection Directive. The GDPR has imposed many new or additional requirements including, but not limited to, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the nature and scope of notifications provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and using third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. Failure to comply with the GDPR could subject us to regulatory sanctions, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution and/or civil fines or penalties. Additionally, GDPR creates a direct cause of action by individual data subjects. The GDPR is a complex law and the regulatory guidance is still evolving, including with respect to how the GDPR should be applied in the context of clinical trials or other transactions from that we may gain access to personal data. Beginning in 2021, the UK will be a “third country” under the GDPR. These changes in the law will increase our costs of compliance and result in greater legal risks. Other countries maintain different privacy laws that we are subject to.
 Approval Outside the United States/European Union
 For marketing outside the United States and the European Union, we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. Whether or not FDA or European Commission approval has been obtained for a product, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States or the European Union, as the case may be, must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries. Approval in one country does not assure that a product will be approved in another country. In certain countries, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar to those in the United States and the European Union, where approval decisions by regulators are based on the regulators’ review of the results of clinical trials performed for specific indications. Other countries may have a less comprehensive review process in terms of data requirements and may rely on prior marketing approval from a foreign regulatory authority in other countries such as the United States or the European Union. In many countries outside of the United States, approvals for pricing, coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans, are also required.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 69 active employees, of which 14 had M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and 46 were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
