Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on August 18, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, completion of our initial public offering (referred to herein as our “Initial Public Offering”) and the evaluation of possible business combinations, and we have neither engaged in any other operations nor generated any revenues. Based on our business activities to date, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have minimal operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash held in a trust account. 
 The Company was co-founded by Hudson Executive Capital LP (“Hudson Executive Capital”), a value-oriented, event-driven investment firm with a focus on, and experience across, the financial services and healthcare sectors, Douglas L. Braunstein, our President and Chairman, and Douglas G. Bergeron, our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Braunstein is the Founder and a Managing Partner of Hudson Executive Capital and Mr. Bergeron is a Managing Partner. Hudson Executive Capital, which is an affiliate, was founded in 2015 and has a successful history investing in undervalued domestic small and mid-cap public companies with identified and actionable opportunities for value creation. Since Hudson Executive Capital’s inception, the majority of its employed capital has been focused on financial services and healthcare.

 Company History 
 On August 21, 2020, the sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering costs of the Company in consideration of 14,375,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock (the “founder shares”). On February 23, 2021, the Company effected a 718,750 stock dividend resulting in 15,093,750 founder shares outstanding. The founder shares included an aggregate of up to 1,968,750 shares of Class B common stock that were subject to forfeiture by the sponsor. As a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option, a total of 1,875,000 shares are no longer subject to forfeiture and 93,750 shares were forfeited as the underwriters did not exercise their overallotment option in full before its expiration. On February 26, 2021, we completed our Initial Public Offering of 60,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (“units”), generating gross proceeds of $600,000,000. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“warrant”). Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments and conditions. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 9,333,334 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”), each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, or $14,000,001 in the aggregate. An aggregate of $600,000,000 from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “trust account”) such that the trust account held $600,000,000 at the time of closing of the Initial Public Offering. 
 On April 14, 2021, we announced that, commencing on April 16, 2021, holders of the units sold in our Initial Public Offering may elect to separately trade the Class A common stock and warrants included in the units. Those units not separated will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “HIIIU,” and the Class A common stock and warrants that are separated will trade on the Nasdaq under the symbols “HIII” and “HIIIW,” respectively. We did not issue fractional warrants upon separation of the units.

  At December 31, 2021, funds held in the trust account consisted solely of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. A portion of interest income on the funds held in the trust account may be released to us to pay tax obligations. 
 Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC’s internet site (http://www.sec.gov) contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. 
 Further, section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with certain other public companies difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. We intend to continue to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th or (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. 
 Facilities 
 In September 2021, we became a fully remote company. Accordingly, we do not maintain a principal office.

We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. 
Legal Proceedings
