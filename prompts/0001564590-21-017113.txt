 Based on similar economic and operational characteristics, the Company’s business is aggregated into one reportable segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7 for selective enterprise information.
 AMVAC is a California corporation that traces its history from 1945 and is a specialty chemical manufacturer that develops and markets products for agricultural, commercial and consumer uses. It manufactures and formulates chemicals for crops, turf and ornamental plants, and human and animal health protection. These chemicals, which include insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, molluscicides, growth regulators, and soil fumigants, are marketed in liquid, powder, and granular forms. AMVAC primarily synthesizes, formulates, and distributes its own proprietary products or custom manufactures, formulates or distributes for others. In addition, the Company has carved out a leadership position in closed delivery systems, currently offers certain of its products in SmartBox, Lock ‘n Load and EZ Load systems, and is commercializing a precision application technology known as SIMPAS (see “Intellectual Property” below) which permits the delivery of multiple products (from AMVAC and/or other companies) at variable rates in a single pass. AMVAC has historically expanded its business through both the acquisition of established chemistries, the development and commercialization of new formulations or compounds through licensing arrangements and by expanding its distribution network to gain broader market access. 
 AMVAC BV is a Netherlands Corporation that was established in 2012 and is based in Utrecht, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands. AMVAC BV sells product both directly and through its network of subsidiaries in various international territories. 
 Below is a description of the Company’s acquisition/licensing activity over the past four years. 
 On October 8, 2020, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, AVD Australia, completed the purchase of all outstanding shares of AgNova. AgNova is an Australian company that sources, develops, and distributes specialty crop protection and production solutions for agricultural and horticultural producers and for selected non-crop users. AgNova has an established reputation for cost-effective product development from original concept through evaluation, registration, marketing, and sales, with new technologies flowing from its development pipeline. AgNova is committed to the provision of innovative, value-adding solutions for agriculture and related industries. The acquired assets included product registration, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, workforce, fixed assets, and existing working capital.

On October 2, 2020, the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC, completed the purchase of all outstanding shares of the Agrinos Group Companies (Agrinos), except for Agrinos AS. Agrinos AS was taken under administration as a bankruptcy estate by the Norwegian bankruptcy court in Oslo. In addition to the shares of Agrinos, AMVAC acquired certain intellectual property rights. Agrinos is a fully integrated biological input supplier with proprietary technology, internal manufacturing, and global distribution capabilities. Its High Yield Technology® product platform works in conjunction with other nutritional crop inputs to increase crop yield, improve soil health and reduce the environmental footprint of traditional agricultural practices. The acquired assets included product registration, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, workforce, fixed assets, two factories and existing working capital.
 On April 1, 2020, the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC, acquired 6,250,000 common shares of Clean Seed Capital Group Ltd. (Clean Seed), representing an ownership of approximately 8%. In addition, AMVAC licensed from Clean Seed certain intellectual property rights related to Clean Seed’s SMART planting technologies. 
 On December 20, 2019, the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC, completed the purchase of certain assets related to four herbicide products from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, doing-business-as Corteva Agriscience and Dow Agrosciences, LLC., for use in the U.S.. The purchased assets included end-use registrations, registration data, trademarks (specifically, Classic®, First Rate®, Python® and Hornet®), on-hand inventory, commercial sales information, know-how and certain product supply arrangements. 
 On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of three crop protection products for the U.S. market from Raymat Crop Science, Inc. and its affiliate, Esstar Crop Science, Inc. The acquired products are the miticide etoxazole, the insect growth regulator Diflubenzuron, and a rice herbicide bispyribac sodium (Arroz). The acquired assets included product registrations, trademarks and trade names, customer lists and associated on-hand inventory. 
 On January 10, 2019, the Company’s international subsidiary AMVAC do Brazil completed the purchase of Defensive and Agrovant, two distribution companies based in Brazil. Defensive and Agrovant market and distribute crop protection products and micronutrients with focus on the fruit and vegetable market segments throughout Brazil. The acquired entities are holding assets that consist, in part, of product registration, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, workforce, fixed assets, and existing working capital.
 On December 28, 2018, the Company’s international subsidiary AMVAC BV completed the purchase of certain assets related to the Quizalofop product family from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. Quizalofop is an herbicide marketed under the name Assure II for use on canola, soybeans and pulse (among other things) in Canada and the U.S.. The acquired assets included product rights, registration data, trademarks, and on-hand inventory. Subsequently, AMVAC BV transferred the acquired assets related to the U.S. market to AMVAC. 
 On December 14, 2018, AMVAC completed the purchase of certain assets related to the trichlorfon product line from Bayer AG and Bayer CropScience AG (“Bayer”). Trichlorfon is an insecticide marketed under the name Dylox in turf, ornamental and other markets. This transaction included product registrations, trademarks and manufacturing know-how. AMVAC manufactures and supplies formulated end use products to Bayer (for the professional turf market) and to SBM (for the consumer lawn market).
 On November 9, 2018, AMVAC completed the purchase of all of the outstanding shares of TyraTech, Inc. and, in the process, delisted TyraTech from the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. TyraTech develops non-toxic insecticides and green solutions for pest control. Their patented technology platform leverages synergistic essential oil combinations to target invertebrate pest receptors that are not active in humans and other mammals.
 On June 20, 2018, AMVAC completed the purchase of certain intangible assets related to the bromacil product family including end use registrations in the U.S.. The assets were purchased from Bayer AG. Bromacil is a broad-spectrum residual herbicide used for non-agricultural industrial vegetation control and on many crops such as pineapples, citrus, agave and asparagus. Marketed under the Hyvar® and Krovar® brands, bromacil herbicides are valued and long-established weed control tools. Amvac already owned these registrations for markets outside the U.S. and Canada through a prior purchase. 
 Seasonality
 The agricultural chemical industry, in general, is cyclical in nature. The demand for AVD’s products tends to be seasonal. Seasonal usage, however, does not necessarily follow calendar dates, but more closely follows growing patterns, weather conditions, geography, weather related pressure from pests and customer marketing programs. 
 3

Backlog
 AVD primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders. The purchase orders are typically fulfilled within a short time frame. As a result, backlog is not considered a significant factor of AVD’s business.
Customers
 The Company’s largest three customers accounted for 17%, 12% and 10% of the Company’s sales in 2020; 18%, 14% and 7% in 2019; and 12%, 9% and 8% in 2018.
 Distribution
 In the U.S. AMVAC predominantly distributes its products through national distribution companies and buying groups or co-operatives, which purchase AMVAC’s goods on a purchase order basis and, in turn, sell them to retailers/growers/end-users. 
 Internationally, AMVAC BV has sales offices or wholly owned distributors in Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Australia, and India, and sales force executives or sales agents in a number of other territories. The Company’s domestic and international distributors, agents and customers typically have long-established relationships with retailers/end-users, far-reaching logistics, transportation capabilities and/or customer service expertise. The markets for AVD products vary by region, target crop, use and type of distribution channel. AVD’s customers are experts at addressing these various markets. 
 Competition
 In its many marketplaces, AVD faces competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than AVD. AVD’s capacity to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and/or expand its product lines and customer base. AVD competes principally on the basis of quality, product efficacy, price, technical service and customer support. In some cases, AVD has positioned itself in smaller niche markets, which are no longer addressed by larger companies. In other cases, for example in the Midwest corn and soybean markets, the Company competes directly with larger competitors.
Manufacturing
 Through its six manufacturing facilities (see Item 2, Properties), AVD synthesizes many of the technical grade active ingredients that are in its end-use products. Further, the Company formulates and packages its end use products at its own facilities or at the facilities of third-party formulators in the U.S. and at various international locations. Furthermore, we noted earlier that, in October 2020, the Company completed the purchase of Agrinos. That biological business owns two manufacturing sites, one in the U.S. and the second in Mexico, and has product manufactured at a third-party facility in India.
Raw Materials
 AVD utilizes numerous companies to supply the various raw materials and components used in manufacturing its products. Many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources. In those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic, AVD seeks to secure its supply by either long-term (multi-year) arrangements or purchasing on long lead times from its suppliers. Further, where the availability or cost of certain raw materials may be subject to the effect of tariffs, the Company may order goods at times or in volumes out of the ordinary course in order to optimize pricing and to ensure supply.
Intellectual Property
 AVD’s proprietary product formulations are protected, to the extent possible, as trade secrets and, to a lesser extent, by patents. Certain of the Company’s closed delivery systems are patented, and the Company has both pending and issued patents relating to its equipment portfolio, particularly with respect to its SIMPAS and Ultimus technology. Further, AVD’s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets. AVD considers that, in the aggregate, its product registrations, trademarks, licenses, customer lists and patents constitute valuable assets. While it does not regard its current business as being materially dependent upon any single product registration, trademark, license, or patent, it believes that patents will play an increasingly important role in its developmental equipment technology in future years, including with respect to its Envance essential oils technology.
 4

EPA Registrations
 In the U.S., AVD’s products also receive protection afforded by the terms of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), pursuant to which it is unlawful to sell any pesticide in the U.S., unless such pesticide has first been registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”). Most of the Company’s products that are sold in the U.S. are subject to USEPA registration and periodic re-registration requirements and are registered in accordance with FIFRA. This registration by USEPA is based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment, when used according to approved label directions. In addition, each state requires a specific registration before any of AVD’s products can be marketed or used in that state. State registrations are predominantly renewed annually with a smaller number of registrations that are renewed on a multiple year basis. Foreign jurisdictions typically have similar registration requirements by statute. 
 The USEPA, state, and foreign agencies have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by AVD. AVD, on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants, has furnished, and is currently furnishing, required data relative to specific products. Under FIFRA, the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support U.S. registrations. This requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as regulatory compliance, with USEPA and other such bodies in the markets in which the Company sells its products. In addition, at times, the Company is required to generate new formulations of existing products or to produce new products in order to remain compliant. The Company expensed $15,613, $13,989 and $16,047, during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on these activities.

Environmental
 Commerce Site
 During 2020, AMVAC continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility in Commerce, CA. (the “Facility”). An outline of the history of those activities follows.
 In 1995, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (“DTSC”) conducted a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Facility Assessment (“RFA”) of those facilities having hazardous waste storage permits. In March 1997, the RFA culminated in DTSC accepting the Facility into its Expedited Remedial Action Program. Under this program, the Facility was required to conduct an environmental investigation and health risk assessment. This activity then took two paths: first, the RCRA permit closure and second, the larger site characterization.
 With respect to the RCRA permit closure, in 1998, AMVAC began the formal process to close its hazardous waste permit at the Facility (which had allowed AMVAC to store hazardous waste longer than 90 days) as required by federal regulations. Formal regulatory closure actions began in 2005 and were completed in 2008, as evidenced by DTSC’s October 1, 2008 acknowledgement of AMVAC’s Closure Certification Report.
 With respect to the larger site characterization, soil and groundwater characterization activities began in December 2002 in accordance with the Site Investigation Plan that was approved by DTSC. Additional activities were conducted from 2003 to 2014, with oversight provided by DTSC. In 2014, the Company submitted a remedial action plan (“RAP”) to DTSC, under the provisions of which, the Company proposed not to disturb sub-surface contaminants, but to continue monitoring, maintain the cover above affected soil, enter into restrictive covenants regarding the potential use of the property in the future, and provide financial assurances relating to the requirements of the RAP.  In January 2017, the RAP was circulated for public comment.  DTSC responded to those comments and, on September 29, 2017, approved the RAP as submitted by the Company. The Company continues to conduct groundwater monitoring and maintain the cover above affected soil and is working with DTSC to prepare an operation and maintenance plan, to record covenants on certain affected parcels and to obtain further clarification on financial assurance obligations relating to the RAP.  At this stage, the Company does not believe that costs to be incurred in connection with the RAP will be material and has not recorded a loss contingency for these activities.

Other Environmental
 AMVAC is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at its six manufacturing facilities both in the U.S. and abroad. The Company continually adapts its manufacturing, storage, transportation, handling and disposal processes to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory and other agencies to which it is subject. The USEPA and other foreign, federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on the Company’s operations.
 AMVAC expends substantial funds to minimize the risk of discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment. Wherever feasible, the Company recovers and recycles raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs.
 The Company is committed to a long-term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment, as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns.
 Human Capital Resources
 We believe that, beyond being essential to our operations, our people have inestimable worth independent of our business. As outlined in our Human Rights Policy (see, www.american-vanguard.com under ESG tab), we believe that it is fundamental to our corporate responsibility and, indeed, to our humanity, that we recognize, respect and nurture the freedom and dignity of all persons. Accordingly, we have insinuated that belief throughout the fabric of our operations in our approach toward our employees. Indeed, the first two core values underlying our commitment to sustainability (see, 2017/2018 Sustainability Report, www.american-vanguard.com under ESG tab) are “Safety First” – which is a culture that begins with highly-regulated manufacturing plants, continues into the design of science-backed products and extends into market-leading delivery systems – and “Making a Difference” – under which, by rewarding achievement and giving our employees a voice, we attract diverse employees who want to make a difference in their careers, in the company and in the communities that we serve. 
 The most salient feature of success in managing human capital has been our ability to attract and retain excellent talent. We are not the largest company within our sector – in fact, we are possibly the smallest public company dedicated to crop inputs and precision application technology. However, we have consistently drawn high-achieving, successful personnel from much larger competitors, largely due to the fact that we are not only collegial and nimble, but also offer employees the chance to make a difference, to be themselves, to think creatively. 
 Another important practice in managing human capital is that we offer among the most generous healthy benefits in the industry – minimal employee contribution, copays, out-of-pocket limits. (See also the Compensation Discussion & Analysis in our 2020 Proxy Statement at www.american-vanguard.com, click on SEC filings). We also provide a comprehensive wellness program, with annual biometric testing and incentives for health coaching. These programs serve to keep the employee population and their families healthy. Further, these programs are, for the most part, self-insured and represent a direct and important investment in our people. 
 We are also one of the only public companies of which we are aware that gives awards of our common stock to the entire full-time workforce. Most public companies limit their stock awards to those in the highest echelon. We do not. Rather, we believe that all employees should share in our long-term success and that those who work for the company should have the perspective of both employee and shareholder. This practice also engenders a sense of greater permanency in the work relationship through which employees are more inclined to propose plans and solutions for the future. Similarly, unlike many public companies, we allocate our incentive compensation throughout the entire workforce, thereby rewarding their contribution to our companywide performance. As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed 771 employees. The Company employed 671 employees as of December 31, 2019 and 624 employees as of December 31, 2018. From time to time, due to the seasonality of its business, AVD uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products. None of the Company’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees.

The Company’s Operations in a Pandemic
 Having been categorized as a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has since spread, at the time of this document, to infect over 100 million people and caused over 2 million fatalities worldwide. Like many other companies, we have had to adapt quickly and frequently to ensure the health and safety of the workplace while maintaining operations without disruption. Our mission was driven in part by our legal status. Under applicable federal guidelines (at https://www.cisa.gov), the Company is part of the nation’s “critical infrastructure” and falls within three of the 16 sectors that are specially permitted to operate:  “Food and Agriculture” sector (engaged in “the production of chemicals and other substances used by the food and agriculture industry, including pesticides, herbicides etc.”), the “Chemical” sector (supporting the operation . . . of facilities (particularly those with high risk chemicals . . . whose work cannot be done remotely and requires the presence of highly trained personnel to ensure safe operations”) and the “Public Works and Infrastructure Support Services” sector (in support of public health including pest control and exterminators, landscapers and others who provide services to residences and businesses). In issuing guidance on Coronavirus, then President Donald J. Trump said, “If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule [emphasis added].” We have found that state COVID-19 orders and, indeed, even those of countries in which the outbreak has been most pronounced, have consistently excepted food supply as an area essential to the survival of its populations and, as such, had given special permission to companies, such as ours, to continue to operate during the pandemic. 
 In light of our status within the critical infrastructure, at the outset of the pandemic, the Company took swift action to understand, contain and mitigate the risks posed by this pandemic. Specifically, we formed a Pandemic Work Group to design and implement protocols for social distancing, make provisions for the workforce to work remotely where possible, establish quarantine, tracing and leave-of-absence policies for those who present COVID-like symptom or may have been in touch with those who have. Further, the group has kept current with local, state, federal and international laws and restrictions that could affect the business; provided real-time information to the workforce including with respect to testing and vaccinations; and drawn from political commentary and news statements concrete directions on how best to continue operations. We have also prepared contingency plans to permit the continued operation of our factories, in the event that there are critical staffing issues due to attrition. Further, we have continuously monitored supply chain, transport, logistics and border closures and have reached out to third-parties to make clear that we are continuing to operate, that we have our own policies relating to health and safety (e.g., all staff who can work remotely were instructed so to do and were provided with the necessary IT equipment, no third-party visitors, no face-to-face meetings) and are committed to compliance with COVID-19 policies of our business partners. Our CEO and the Pandemic Work Group have held regular “state of the company” calls with the functional heads of our businesses across the globe to ensure that our information is shared in a timely manner and that our direction is clear. 
 In keeping with our charge to operate as an essential business and by virtue of our efforts to contain and mitigate the risks posed by the pandemic, we have been able to manage our business with minimal disruption during the reporting period. As referred to in this Form 10-K (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the coronavirus has affected our overall performance to a degree. Lost opportunities for certain new product launches, inability to meet both existing and potential new customers face-to-face, reduced demand for commodity crops sold to restaurants, and foreign exchange effects in Brazil, Mexico and Australia, have likely limited the Company’s top-line growth by up to several million dollars and the associated profitability, to an indeterminate degree, since the inception of the pandemic.  
 Risk Management
 The Company regularly monitors matters, whether insurable or not, that could pose material risk to its operations, the safety of its employees and neighbors, and its financial performance. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (“Board”) was formed in 2010, consists of four members of the Board and meets regularly. However, all members of the Board are invited to and regularly attend Risk Committee meetings. Working with senior management, the committee continuously evaluates the Company’s risk profile, identifies mitigation measures and ensures that the Company is prudently managing these risks. 
 8

Further, in support of the Risk Committee, senior management has appointed a risk manager who is focused on addressing each of the most material risks facing the Company. The top risks identified by management (in no particular order) include: adverse political and regulatory climate; managing inventory and optimizing manufacturing efficiency; succession planning and bench strength; maintaining a competitive edge in the marketplace; the possibility of an environmental event; undervaluation of the Company; availability of acquisition and licensing targets and cyber-terrorism. In addition, the Company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability, property damage and other potential areas of risk. Management believes its facilities and equipment are adequately insured against loss from usual business risks including cyber-terrorism.
 Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
 At the center of our ESG commitment is the principle of Sustainable Agriculture. While this concept has been used by many to mean many different things, we have given it a very clear meaning. In our parlance, Sustainable Agriculture is broad enough to encompass a comprehensive ESG program, but clear enough to give us direction in our outlook and purpose in our activities. Please click on the “ESG” tab at www.american-vanguard.com to access the documents mentioned below. 
 Access to food is a basic human right and is at the core of our commitment to sustainable agriculture. All people should be able to rely on a stable, affordable food supply both now and into the future. We are committed to meeting that need upon a foundation of social responsibility and equity. In that vein, we believe that sustainable agriculture must include these three principles:
 Climate Equity – as outlined in our Climate Change Commitment, we are committed to making enterprise-wide, progressive and measurable efforts to do our part to help to arrest the trend of global warming. In making decisions, taking actions and conducting our operations we are mindful of climate equity, which holds that climate change has three primary effects – generational, regional and individual. To that end, we believe that reducing our carbon footprint and, through our products and services, enabling others to do so will advance climate equity consistent with the goal of a 2-degree warmer world, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. Whether in terms of eco-friendly products – such as natural oils from Envance (used in Proctor & Gamble’s Zevo product line), microbial High Yield solutions from Agrinos (that enhance soil health and promote carbon sequestration) or tailored bionutritional products from Greenplants – or delivery systems, such as our SIMPAS precision application system that maximizes yield while minimizing the environmental footprint – we are endeavoring to making the planet a better place than we found it. 
 Environmental Equity – we recognize that our planet has limited resources and that what we do with them has an effect on the habitat for both humans and other species, both for today and tomorrow. We also recognize that our activities can affect the environment generationally, regionally and individually. We are, therefore, committed to environmental equity in our operations. Specifically, and as more fully outlined in our sustainability reports, we seek to conserve finite resources such as water, land and energy while protecting the environment and enhancing biodiversity, so that these resources are available in amounts and quality to support our neighbors and future generations. In addition, we have committed significant resources toward supporting growers with precision application technology – like SIMPAS and Ultimus – that enable growers to manage, optimize and trace the use of crop and soil inputs, and to use only what is needed, precisely where it is needed. Furthermore, we are mindful of those who might be disproportionately affected by what we do, such as loaders and applicators of our products. To that end, we have been at the forefront of user-friendly, closed delivery systems (from Lock ‘n Load to SMARTBox to SIMPAS/SmartCartridges) to minimize exposure and maximize safety for those on-the-ground. 
 Food Equity – we are committed to the proposition that access to food is a basic human right. Implicit in that commitment is the principle of food equity, which has three aspects, once again, generational, regional and individual. First, food security – we believe it is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of the global agricultural industry. We contribute toward food security by investing in eco-friendly solutions and in new technology, like SIMPAS, that give growers the best tools possible to ensure that their operations are viable, both today and tomorrow. Second, food availability – ensuring that food gets from field to table. As we saw in the pandemic, the supply chain for food can be broken, and those who suffer most are often those farthest from the fields. To that end, we support farm-to-field efforts and programs to reduce food waste. Third, food affordability – ensuring that food prices can be maintained for all, including the impoverished. We do this by giving farmers effective tools, including precision application equipment, that optimize their costs, boost their yield, and enable them to produce and market food at reasonable prices. 
 Social Responsibility – our discussion of Sustainable Agriculture would not be complete without specific mention of our commitment to social responsibility. This concept is inherent in all forms of equity, be they climate, environmental or food related. However, social responsibility gives us pause to consider factors of a more fundamental nature, such as human rights. Our Human Rights Policy details our essential belief that we respect and support human rights, both within and without our operations. We believe that it is fundamental to our corporate responsibility and, indeed, to our humanity, that we recognize, respect and nurture the freedom and dignity of all persons. To that end, we support the tenets of the International Bill of Human Rights, including the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN framework on Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights (which is one section of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) and the UN International Labor Organization on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

Under the umbrella of Sustainable Agriculture, we are committed to operating our business with a sense of mindfulness – toward the climate, toward the environment and toward the good of humans and other species. We consider ourselves to be part of a broader mission – one of ensuring that people can rely upon a stable, affordable food supply both now and in the future. It is a privilege to be part of that mission. With that privilege comes responsibility, and we take that responsibility seriously.
