Item 1. Business
Overview
New Relic is a strategic observability platform that companies use to build, develop, and operate their digital businesses. We provide software development and IT operations teams with capabilities they need to improve uptime and performance, gain greater scale and efficiency, as well as accelerate their time to market. From the beginning, our ambition has been to instrument more of the digital world than anyone else and help our customers build more perfect software. We exist to continue that work along the expanse of the Internet, because our goal is to establish the standards by which all software and its impact can be measured and improved. 
Digital initiatives have become critical to the success of global businesses across industries. Fundamental technology and business shifts are now enabling continuous improvements to these digital environments. First, organizations around the globe are undertaking digital transformations to meet the demands of an increasingly digitally savvy customer base. Second, companies are increasingly adopting cloud technologies, utilizing the cloud as a new foundational architecture to support their digital business. Both of these shifts have put tremendous pressure on internal technology teams to adapt to these new business demands. In response to this pressure, engineering teams are adopting new agile processes and software development operations, or DevOps, practices that enable them to move to the cloud faster and take advantage of modern infrastructure technologies like microservices and containers, in order to accelerate their pace of innovation and responsiveness to business demands.
New Relic is positioned at the center of these trends, which are changing the way companies build, develop, and operate software. The New Relic One Platform, our integrated, multi-tenant observability platform, enables our customers to collect, store, and analyze vast quantities of telemetry data flowing through and about their software. Building on our leadership in application performance monitoring, or APM, the New Relic One Platform collects and correlates data using a number of different techniques to provide more holistic visibility to our customers. Our end users, primarily developers and operations professionals, are generally tasked with creating and deploying software code, with the goal of driving revenue growth, increasing productivity, and enhancing brand value at their companies. Customers using the New Relic One Platform are empowered to build and release software into production more quickly, all while maintaining or improving uptime and stability, to improve their competitive position in a global environment where software is a critical differentiator.
We offer our customers a fully integrated software solution that provides visibility into every layer of the modern software stack, from application performance to infrastructure health to the end-user experience. Our cloud-based platform is open and connected, with out-of-the-box curated experiences for our customers, enabling them to scale to meet the ever-changing needs of their businesses. In addition, our platform is programmable, which allows users to go beyond our curated experiences to build use cases unique to their data and business workflows.
Our Growth Strategy
We employ a land, expand, and standardize go-to-market strategy, which combines grassroots user adoption with both customized low-touch and high-touch sales approaches. We often land in new accounts to support grassroots projects, often with our flagship APM capabilities, and because our products are easy to get started with, users often grow our footprint within their companies, as they increase the number of applications monitored and expand their use of our products. This allows customers to develop into accounts with hundreds of users across multiple roles, each accessing a common set of data through the New Relic One Platform to deliver real-time visibility into the operations of their digital business. Over time, we plan to drive efficient growth through the following efforts:
•expanding our installed base by increasing application coverage and benefiting from growth in organic usage;
•adding new customers;
•further penetrating international markets; and
•expanding our platform with additional paid offerings and platform capabilities.
Our Solution
Software and IT teams rely on the breadth and depth of visibility provided by the New Relic One Platform to collect, store, and analyze vast quantities of telemetry data flowing through and about their software. For teams with complex environments, New Relic One empowers them to find, visualize, and understand the entities and their dependencies to innovate faster, make better decisions, and create best-in-class digital experiences. The New Relic One Platform collects and correlates various types of critical telemetry data such as application performance management data, logs, metrics, events and trace data, 
providing customers with the visibility needed to troubleshoot and analyze their applications and infrastructure. New Relic One offers prebuilt dashboards and visualizations as well as the ability to search across data types, create customized dashboards and build applications that can be shared and customized by other users.
The New Relic One Platform uses a common infrastructure to enable customers to:
•Collect. We provide customers with our software code, called agents, to add to their applications and infrastructure. These agents for APM and infrastructure monitoring enable developers and operations teams to easily deploy software code into their applications and related IT infrastructure, including physical and virtual servers, browsers, and mobile devices. We also provide a number of open data application performance interfaces, or APIs, and software development kits, or SDKs, as well as support open source connectors and technologies for customers, partners, and third-party developers to extend our platform into their products, increasing their ability to capture more types of data within the New Relic One Platform. 
•Store. Data collected by our customers is stored in New Relic Database (NRDB), our proprietary, highly secure and scalable cloud-based architecture and big data database. Our database has been crafted so that our customers do not need to build or maintain their own big data solution for digital operations. We have optimized this database to store data as well as handle the analytics and queries that we believe are important to drive decision making.
•Analyze. We provide a number of offerings with out-of-the-box features including New Relic APM, Mobile, Browser, Synthetics, Infrastructure, and Insights. We also offer New Relic chart builder, dashboards and programmability features that allow our customers to use connected data to easily build tailored, flexible, information-dense visuals. Data queries are accessible to team members with a range of experience through basic and advanced chart builder modes. This functionality is designed to enable customers to get answers to their questions quickly without having to re-index or re-instrument their data. In addition, we offer New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes features that work together to enable engineering and operations teams to intelligently spot abnormal behavior across billions of pieces of data, predict where problems may arise, and ultimately provide prescriptive recommendations for problems before they impact customers.
The New Relic One Platform also contains the following platform capabilities:
•New Relic Alerts provides a centralized notification system that delivers alerts from across the products that make up the New Relic One Platform. It allows users to manage alert policies and alert conditions in order to receive early notification to identify potential performance issues and take action.
•New Relic’s extensible architecture provides customers, partners, and third-party developers with APIs, SDKs and open source connectors and technologies to build software integrations and custom applications that extend our functionality and data into other application or IT environments. For example, while our focus is on supporting modern programming languages and frameworks with our agents, some customers and developers have built integrations to address custom or legacy on-premises applications and architectures. In addition, these integrations can also extend the functionality and data from other applications and sources into our databases, including metric and trace data from popular open source software standards.
Key Elements of Our Solution
•SaaS-Based Delivery Model. While we can support many types of customer environments, we designed our products based on cloud architecture and a SaaS delivery model. We are able to provide frequent updates to our software, enabling us to continuously improve it to reflect technology developments. This approach delivers a wide range of technology and financial benefits to our customers over on-premises architectures, including potential faster time to market, accelerated return on investment, and lower total cost of ownership.
•Scalable, Flexible Cloud Architecture. Our customers can collectively analyze trillions of data points per day. Because we built our technology with a multi-tenant cloud architecture, customers can leverage its scale to rapidly run queries and get answers without having to build their own expensive infrastructure.
•Visibility Across Applications and Infrastructure. Our customers are rapidly adopting modern technologies like containers and Kubernetes at the infrastructure layer, as well as modern application development patterns like serverless. We provide our customers with visibility from the mobile application or browser through back-end services down to the underlying infrastructure. Our platform provides visibility into cutting edge cloud environments, and legacy on-premises environments, enabling customers to adopt New Relic no matter where they are on their cloud migration journey or if their business requires a traditional data center. 
•Big Data Database and Analytics. NRDB, our proprietary, cloud-based architecture and big data database, leverages modern big data technologies, which enable our users to collect, store, and analyze trillions of data points each day. 
Our schema-less database structure allows customers to easily build dashboards or make ad-hoc queries to deliver real-time insights.
•Enterprise-grade Security. We have developed robust security processes to help protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data so that users can control how their data is stored and used. We undergo annual audits by third-party services, including AICPA SOC2 Type 2 and FedRAMP/NIST 800-53-based assessments. Our platform and products have also achieved FedRAMP authorization at a moderate impact level, and our Chicago data center is Tier III SOC2 certified. In addition, we voluntarily participate in the Cloud Star Alliance’s Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry.
•Easy and Intuitive. We design our products to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly. Users are able to learn, deploy, and begin using our products, often within a few minutes. This is beneficial to developers and operations teams, who do not need to do extra coding or configuration to use our products. It is also important for business and technical users who can leverage our products to augment their existing knowledge of applications and infrastructure.
•Integrated Suite. Our products and platform capabilities share a common design and user interface and access the same cloud-based architecture. Users can move seamlessly among different analytic categories and use cases for their data. Users are able to easily add products to extend their ability to obtain insights from their same or new portions of their data.
Employees
As of March 31, 2020, we had 2,131 employees, including temporary employees. We also engage consultants. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Operations
We host our applications and serve all our customers from data centers and a combination of cloud hosting providers. We utilize third parties to manage the infrastructure at our data centers. In addition, we are continuing to build out services and functionality in the public cloud with a view to migrating more software to the public cloud over time. This strategy provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and scale our deployment capabilities. We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of our data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers. Our technology uses multi-tenant architecture, enabling all our customers to share the same version of our products and platform capabilities while securely partitioning their data.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of all aspects of the New Relic One Platform suite of products and platform capabilities. We invest heavily in these efforts to continuously improve, innovate, and add new features to our solutions.
We deploy new features, functionality, and technologies through daily and weekly software releases or updates in order to minimize disruption and provide for constant improvement. Our product managers regularly engage with customers, partners, and industry analysts, as well as other stakeholders, in functions such as sales, customer success, marketing, and business development to understand customer needs as well as general trends in our industry. Once product improvements are identified, the development organization works closely together to design, develop, test, and launch a solution.
The majority of our research and development team is based in our Portland, Oregon office, but also has a significant presence in our offices in San Francisco, California, Barcelona, Spain and Tel Aviv, Israel. To foster rapid innovation, our team is further apportioned into smaller, agile development teams.
As of March 31, 2020, we had 596 employees in our research and development organization. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to drive market awareness, create and manage user and customer leads, provide qualified leads to our sales pipeline, and build customer relationships to drive revenue growth. As of March 31, 2020, we had 1,018 employees in our sales and marketing organization.
Sales
We sell our products to businesses of all sizes largely through our direct sales organization, with our primary focus on larger accounts. Our direct sales organization is organized by geography and size of customer and is focused on growing the number of accounts and usage within accounts (i.e. providing our customers with a broader set of our product solutions).
Our sales strategy is based on the size of the opportunity and the target user at an organization (e.g., software developers, DevOps engineers, or IT managers).
Marketing
Our marketing strategy focuses on meaningful interactions with practitioners and buyers by targeting software developers, operations professionals, IT leaders, and technology executives across many industries and regions. Additionally, our digital engagement strategy, demand generation, customer programs, events, corporate communications, and product marketing teams focus on building brand, engagement, and demand with our target markets. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online banner and video advertising, our website, product demonstrations and trials, blogs, corporate communications, whitepapers, case studies, user events, sponsorships, and webinars. We believe an effective method to market our platform is for users to actively use and explore its capabilities. We encourage free trials of one or more of our products in order to successfully convert those accounts to paid subscriptions.
Seasonality
We have experienced increased seasonality in our sales and operating results, and the first two quarters of each fiscal year usually have lower or potentially negative sequential deferred revenue growth than the third and fourth fiscal quarters, during which we generally benefit from a larger renewal base and opportunity to up-sell existing customers. Over time, these trends could lead to stronger sequential revenue results in our fourth and first fiscal quarters as our deferred revenue is recognized.
Customer Support
Our products and platform capabilities are designed to minimize the need for customer support, as users can easily download, install, and deploy our software agents without needing support. We offer a range of customer support options with multiple levels of support. These include free community support, email support, and phone support, up to our customer support organization, which provides dedicated customer success representatives, onsite support, with global capabilities and is available at all hours of the day. Through our training platform, we offer courses to help our customers quickly learn how to effectively use our products as well as implement best practices. Courses are available online, in-person at events, and, as requested by certain customers, on-site. Our training sessions are typically targeted at specific levels of employee seniority and product experience, such as agent essentials or administrator experts, to more effectively tailor training to intended audiences.
Partnerships and Strategic Relationships
We have built marketing relationships with a number of technology companies to help promote and grow our user base and footprint. We also have developed relationships with several cloud providers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and others, through which we collaborate to ensure our products and platform capabilities work well on applications running on their clouds. These providers offer access to our products and platform capabilities through links on their websites, refer developers and other potential users to us, and expand our marketing reach. Additionally, a growing number of system integrators, consultants, and value-added resellers are using the New Relic One Platform to help their customers make the resourcing and prioritization decisions necessary for successful cloud migrations and transformation projects.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Our observability platform combines functionality from numerous traditional product categories, and hence we compete in each of these categories with home-grown and open-source technologies, as well as a number of different commercial vendors.
With respect to application performance monitoring, we compete with providers such as AppDynamics, Inc. (an operating division of Cisco Systems, Inc.) and Dynatrace, Inc. With respect to log management, we compete with Elastic NV and Splunk Inc. With respect to infrastructure monitoring, we compete with diversified technology vendors such as International Business Machines Corporation, BMC Software, Inc. and CA, Inc. (a subsidiary of Broadcom, Inc.); with native solutions from cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Google LLC; and with independent vendors such as Datadog, Inc.
The principal competitive factors in our market include:
•product and platform features, architecture, reliability, security, performance, effectiveness, and supported environments;
•product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
•digital operations expertise;
•ease of use of products and platform capabilities;
•price and total cost of ownership;
•adherence to industry standards and certifications;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•focus on customer success.
We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, common law, and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and domain names to protect our intellectual property. As of March 31, 2020, we had 16 issued patents in the United States and abroad, and 38 patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We are also the registered holder of a variety of United States and international domain names that include the term New Relic. Our products utilize our “New Relic” trademark as well as our logo and images.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
Companies in Internet-related industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
