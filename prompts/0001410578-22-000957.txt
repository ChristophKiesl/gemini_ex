Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a technology-driven, leading provider of communications infrastructure services, power grid modernization, and renewables solutions to the North American telecommunications and utilities industries. We provide a variety of mission-critical services across the telecom and renewable energy value chain, including wireline and fiber optic terminations, wireless, fiber-to-the-home, or FTTH, and customer fulfillment activities. Our experienced management team has leveraged our technical expertise, rigorous quality and safety standards, and execution track record to establish and maintain long-standing relationships with blue-chip customers.
We operate out of two business segments: Telecom and Renewables & Recovery Logistics. Telecom consists of wireless, wireline, and power, which represented 81% of our revenues for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. We entered the renewable infrastructure sector with our acquisition of Fiber Network Solutions, LLC (“FNS”) in January 2021, which represented 5% of our revenues for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. Recovery Logistics represented 14% of our revenues for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.
Telecommunications
We provide a full suite of services to the telecom sector across both the wireless and wireline markets, from site acquisition and permitting to initial engineering and design to installation, maintenance, program management and fulfillment. Our core offerings consist of:

· | We also provide cable and satellite fulfillment services for residential and commercial customers. These services are provided for telecom companies in connection with the maintenance or expansion of new and existing networks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the telecommunications industry is naturally concentrated, we maintain customer diversification across our business segments. We have numerous long-established relationships with telephone companies, wireless carriers, multiple cable system operators and electric utilities companies, which have been built upon and cultivated through numerous Master Service Agreements (“MSAs”) that extend for periods of one or more years (majority are for three or more years, some of which have auto-renewal provisions). Blue-chip, investment grade customers including AT&T, Verizon, COX Communications, T-Mobile, Spectrum, and Comcast comprise a substantial portion of our revenue.
Within our Telecommunications segment we also provide electrical contracting, and utility construction and maintenance services. We construct and maintain overhead and underground distribution systems for municipalities, electric membership cooperatives, and electric-utility companies.
Renewables and Recovery Logistics
We entered the renewable infrastructure sector with our acquisition of FNS in January 2021. FNS is a full-service provider of fiber optic and electrical services, focusing primarily on renewable energy projects. Our capabilities in the space include expertise in wind and solar farm fiber, installation, and testing, optical ground wire (“OPGW”) & all-dielectric self-supporting, or ADSS, aerial transmission line installation, and large-scale data com solutions and installation.
In serving our customers, we provide fiber optic terminations, optical time domain reflectometer (“OTDR”) and power meter testing, fusion splicing, fiber placement, extensive fiber optic and copper infrastructure installation, cable jetting, boring and trenching, industry specific maintenance and material procurement.

We also provide business continuity and disaster relief services to telecommunications and power utility companies, as well as business-as-usual, or BAU, services such as generator storage and repair and cell maintenance services.
Geographic Presence
Our consolidated business has a national footprint with approximately 80 service locations across the U.S., strategically located in close proximity to major customers and growing markets. Our geographic footprint has grown to its present state both organically and through strategic acquisitions. QualTek serves markets locally through a dedicated in-house employee base of approximately 1,900 employees and a workforce of over 5,000 individuals (inclusive of in-house employees). Ultimately, we are a technology-driven provider of communications infrastructure services and solutions to the North American telecommunications and utilities industries, and we believe we are well-positioned for continued growth.

Industry Overview
Telecommunications
Significant advances in technology and rapid innovation in service offerings to data consumers have substantially increased demand for faster and more reliable wireless and wireline/fiber communications network services. Cisco’s 2020 Annual Internet Report predicts that by 2023, North Americans will have 5 billion networked devices/connections, up from 3 billion in 2018, with a nearly tripling of broadband and wireless speeds (measured in Mbps) over the same time period.
With the proliferation of mobile devices, advancements in the “internet of things,” or IoT, and segments of the workforce permanently shifting to remote work post-COVID-19, network traffic is at an all-time high and is expected to continue to grow, generating demand for both wired and wireless connectivity. Increased data usage is driven by two key dynamics: i) an increase in the number of internet-enabled devices per capita and ii) an increase in connection speed. The 2020 Cisco Report provides that devices and connections are growing faster (10% CAGR) than both the population (1% CAGR) and internet users (6% CAGR). As a result, devices and connections per household and per capita in North America are expected to grow 63%, up from 8.2 in 2018 to 13.4 by 2023.
COVID-19 has further catalyzed network traffic growth by creating permanent shifts away from the office and into the home. Per a 2020 Gartner report, 75% of companies are planning to permanently shift to remote work post COVID-19, which will continue to drive consumer demand for high-speed home office connectivity.

Low levels of fiber penetration and the nascent state of North American 5G deployment currently present significant opportunities for sustained growth for businesses such as QualTek:

· | Wireless: Major carriers have continued to expand wireless network capacity and density with accelerated development and planned implementation of 5G wireless technologies. The increased speed and capacity that will result from deployment of 5G technology will require additional and improved tower capacity with higher data frequencies, as well as deployment of numerous higher bandwidth small cells to “densify” network performance. Wireless technology will need to be supported by fiber backbone and as a result, many carriers have committed to investing in the fiber infrastructure buildout.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Wired: Telecommunication companies have also deployed capital and initiatives to improve fiber connectivity. Only about 10-15% of total broadband connections in the U.S. are provisioned by fiber, as compared to over 50% in other developed countries such as South Korea, Sweden and Finland. Importantly, with only about 47 million U.S. homes (about 37% as per the Fiber Broadband Association) passed with fiber in 2019, over 100 million U.S. homes represent opportunities for fiber passing over the next several years, indicating a massive investment cycle that is still in early stages.

Renewable and Recovery Logistics
In 2017 and 2018, solar PV and onshore wind consolidated their dominance in the renewable energy market, representing on average 77% of total finance commitments in renewable energy. The highly modular nature of these technologies, their short project development lead times, increasing competitiveness driven by technology and manufacturing improvements, and government regulations play an important role in explaining these technologies’ large share of global renewable energy investment.

6



Investment in offshore wind has picked up, attracting, on average, $21 billion a year globally between 2013 and 2018, and representing 8% of the total renewable capacity addition in 2018. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), offshore wind holds considerable growth potential and will have a key role to play in achieving a level of deployment to support a decarbonized growth trajectory.
The Biden administration is expected to amplify this increase in spending for renewable power projects. For example, since his first day in office, President Biden has rejoined the 2015 Paris Agreement, committed to investing $400 billion in the next ten years in clean energy and innovation, and set a goal to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. We believe that this will translate into significant government spending in renewables to meet this goal, and also government regulations and policies that promote spending in the renewables space across various sectors of the economy. We believe that the Biden administration’s commitment to renewable energy will create ripple effects across the nation and ultimately lead to more opportunities for us to expand our business with customers.
Competitive Strengths
Culture of Operational Excellence that Resonates with Established Blue-Chip Customer Base
QualTek analyzes and evaluates key performance metrics, from customer satisfaction to technical issues in the field, hiring processes and working capital management. We have fostered a culture of continuous improvement and our operational excellence is reflected in our ability to take market share.

To maintain this operational excellence, we conduct disciplined measuring of key performance indicators, or KPIs, with quality control for every division to ensure industry-leading execution capabilities.
Significant Revenue and Backlog Visibility
Our backlog consists of the estimated amount of revenue we expect to realize from future work on uncompleted contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. A significant portion of our 24-month backlog is attributable to MSAs and other service agreements, none of which require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short or no advance notice. Backlog amounts are determined based on estimates that incorporate historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers.
Our long-standing relationships with blue-chip, investment grade customers enable us to understand our customers’ needs and expand our backlog. Our backlog provides long-term visibility into a recurring and growing revenue base. QualTek has significant revenue visibility given our estimated $2.1 billion two-year backlog of which $2.0 billion relates to our Telecom segment and $0.1 billion relates to our Renewables & Recovery Logistics segment.
Backlog is not a measure defined by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, GAAP results. Participants in our industry often disclose a calculation of their backlog; however, our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or if actual results will be consistent with the estimates included in our forecasts. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings.
Proven Acquisition Strategy with Successful Integration Process
Our management team has demonstrated the success of its unique M&A strategy through the successful identification and integration of nine add-ons in the last three-and-a-half years, including four during 2021.

enables a quick and seamless integration process by onboarding the target business onto QualTek’s supporting IT infrastructure, leveraging our QVision platform to standardize performance within the target business to meet the standard of quality that QualTek delivers.
Our M&A activity has also successfully diversified our revenue base across a number of high quality customers in both the telecommunication and renewable energy sectors, with continued emphasis on providing complementary service offerings to drive cross-sell and capture market share and we expect to continue acquiring target companies at accretive multiples.
World-Class Talent and Management Team
QualTek is led by highly experienced management team that is positioned to drive market share capture and capitalize on sector momentum. Our senior management team has an average of 25+ years of individual industry experience and has worked together for a considerable period of time. Our team is well suited to establish and maintain long-standing relationships with blue-chip customers as a result of our technical expertise, rigorous quality and safety standards, and execution track record.
Strategic Regional Presence across the U.S.
QualTek has a national footprint with approximately 80 strategically located service locations across the U.S. in close proximity to our major customers, allowing us to respond to customer demand swiftly and efficiently. Our presence in multiple regions gives us valuable insight into local market drivers and customer demand, thereby enabling us to provide bespoke services in each market. Due to this presence, QualTek has also built deep relationships with local customers that help drive business development, project execution, and cross-sell opportunities. QualTek serves markets locally through a dedicated in-house employee base of approximately 1,900 employees and its activities provide work for over 5,000 people through the use of subcontracting firms to access a deeper and more flexible labor pool to efficiently deliver on engagements across the region.
Growth Strategy
Expand Service Offerings & Solutions while Leveraging Contract Opportunities
QualTek’s complementary service offering creates an opportunity for us to grow our business with customers in two core ways: by winning more contracts and cross-selling services. We anticipate growth in our Telecom business as spectrum continues to become available. Additionally, we plan to cross-sell our full-suite of wireless services to our existing customer base.
In our Renewables & Recovery Logistics segment, we see significant opportunity to leverage existing customers and footprint for incremental projects. We also expect the Biden administration to promote more spending in renewables, not only through government contracts, but also in other sectors and businesses that will in turn reinvest in renewable energy solutions.
Scaled Growth Leader in the Early Stage of a Multi-Year Telecom and Renewables Infrastructure Spend Cycle
We believe that QualTek is poised to capitalize on attractive industry dynamics and tailwinds. Increasing data consumption across multiple platforms, continued growth of mobile data demand, increasing popularity of video streaming services, and continued expansion of fiber networks are all drivers of carrier demand for network infrastructure. This exponential increase in data traffic will require an upgraded network infrastructure and deeper fiber penetration to serve as the foundation for 5G wireless technology moving forward. Every major carrier, including Verizon and AT&T, has publicly committed to investing in the fiber and 5G build-out.
Continued Value Creation Through Strategic M&A
Since 2012, QualTek has successfully leveraged the experience and track record of our seasoned management team to identify and integrate tuck-in opportunities, which have aided in our growth both organically and inorganically. In the past three-and-a-half years, we have successfully acquired and integrated nine targets. Our origination process is largely centered on management’s deep relationships across the industry, which enable us to actively identify strategic targets in attractive markets or with complementary, value-added service capabilities. Thus, we have a continually evolving platform of high quality potential targets.
QualTek also has a successful history of integrating tuck-ins and providing a conducive environment for target management to achieve earnouts. We are able to leverage our proprietary technology-driven and highly scalable shared services platform to seamlessly integrate and grow the acquisition targets. Over time, we often see a reduction in our acquisition multiple (between pre-acquisition 

8



EBITDA multiple and post-acquisition EBITDA multiple) as QualTek realizes significant growth synergies and expands its business with customers.

--+--------------------------------------------------

Our wind business comprises a majority of the revenue for our Renewables sub-segment for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. Advanced wind turbines include a large number of sensors whose signals are prone to contamination from electrical interference from lightning strikes. It is increasingly common to use fiber optics to galvanically isolate such interfaces, which is more difficult and costly with copper wires. This not only limits the damage of any lightning strikes but also can help reduce the effects of power line noise on sensitive sensor readings. Fiber optics are used for both galvanic isolation purposes and data communications. In addition, offshore turbines are often situated five plus miles from the control center on land, making routine maintenance difficult and costly. As a result, wind turbine operators increasingly rely on complex sensors to monitor efficiently and schedule routine maintenance. Fiber optic cables are the preferred choice from a reliability and ease of maintenance perspective, especially at scale.
Our solar business services help support solar power generation by ensuring that our clients’ farms are running safely and efficiently. In a solar farm power generation system, large amounts of current are generated from the heat of the sun. In order to protect the equipment from current leakage, galvanic insulation becomes important to ensure the power system’s quality and reliability. Fiber optics offer insulation protection from high-voltage/current glitches and unwanted signals into power equipment controls and communication. In addition, fiber optic communication can cover longer link distance connections compared to copper wire. As the solar farms grow in size, monitoring and controlling all the solar panels requires long link distance connections, which is only possible with fiber optic cable.
Recovery Logistics
This sub-segment operates under the brand QualTek Recovery Logistics and provides business continuity, restoration, and disaster relief services to its clients, including AT&T, Verizon, Duke Energy, Gulf Power, and Entergy, amongst others. QualTek Recovery 

11



Logistics is able to deploy recovery teams from any one of QualTek’s approximately 80 locations, enabling rapid responses across North America. Some other services offered include:

· | Recovery Management
--+--------------------


· | Transport Logistics
--+--------------------


· | Temporary Shelter
--+------------------


· | Network Recovery
--+-----------------


· | Fleet Services
--+---------------


· | Energy Resources
--+-----------------


· | Catering
--+---------


· | Sanitation
--+-----------

Through our 2018 acquisition of Recovery Logistics, LLC (“RLI”), we transformed our recovery logistics sub-segment from a regional player with concentration in the Southeast to a fully national presence with a diversified customer base which can be served out of approximately 80 locations. RLI is a leading provider of business continuity and disaster recovery operations for the telecommunications and power utility sectors. RLI helps businesses recover from unplanned events, including hurricanes, winter storms and floods.
QualTek’s recent entry into the renewable energy space positions it to capitalize on sector tailwinds. Within Renewables, there is also significant opportunity for the Company to leverage existing customer relationships, as well as its footprint, to gain traction and win incremental projects. This also applies to QualTek’s Recovery Logistics sub-segment, as the Company may be able to cross-sell recurring maintenance and recovery services to capture incremental revenue and deepen penetration with existing customer relationships. Providing recovery logistics capabilities offers another touchpoint for the Company to deliver high value-added services, underlining QualTek’s extensive repertoire of end-to-end services.
We believe that revenue will continue to be propelled by the government’s focus and spending in the Renewables space, as well as QualTek’s commitment to expanding its service offerings and customer base, specifically in its Recovery Logistics sub-segment.
Contract Overview
QualTek has numerous MSAs with blue chip customers that extend for periods of one or more years, with a majority for three or more years, some of which have automatic renewals, providing meaningful revenue visibility. Generally, the Company maintains multiple agreements with each customer as different geographies and scopes of work are individually priced. Pricing is generally based on a fixed price per unit basis with up to hundreds of units priced in a single contract. Many contracts specify discrete billing milestones for each job to be performed. As an agreed-upon milestone is achieved, QualTek may bill for the work performed. Purchase orders for discrete projects are generally issued under an MSA. This allows for quantity adjustments for the number of tasks/units that are performed with respect to a project. There are also other adjustments such as “rock adders” that accommodate changes in scope versus original engineering plans. As these adjustments are billed continuously throughout the job, they are known and often accepted by the customer as the work proceeds, substantially reducing QualTek’s risk of having cost overruns. MSAs have historically been renewed creating sticky revenue.
QualTek utilizes a disciplined approach when bidding on new contracts and will decline to bid if management believes QualTek cannot deliver the quality that meets Company standards while achieving return targets. The Company’s approach in submitting a bid that meets target returns is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to its:

· | Experience in understanding the true scope of the work and associated margin
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Knowledge of local factors (i.e. resources, regional dynamics, work conditions, etc.) that will impact work to be performed
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




· | Ability to simultaneously “lock-in” labor rates with contracts for the work to be performed on fixed price per unit basis (“back-to-back” agreements with contractors)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pass-through nature of material purchases
--+------------------------------------------

Due to the Company’s turnkey capabilities and high standard for quality control, QualTek often receives requests from customers to bid on new contract opportunities.
Backlog
Our backlog consists of the estimated amount of revenue we expect to realize from future work on uncompleted contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. A significant portion of our 24-month backlog is attributable to MSAs and other service agreements, none of which require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short or no advance notice. Backlog amounts are determined based on estimates that incorporate historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers.
QualTek maintains strong potential revenue visibility through its two-year estimated backlog. Consistent with standard practice across the industry, QualTek calculates its estimated backlog for work under MSAs and other service agreements (including issued purchase orders) based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. We have a two-year aggregate backlog of $2.1 billion of which $2.0 billion relates to our Telecom segment and $0.1 billion relates to our Renewables & Recovery Logistics segment.
Backlog is not a measure defined by GAAP and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, GAAP results. Participants in our industry often disclose a calculation of their backlog; however, our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or if actual results will be consistent with the estimates included in our forecasts. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings.
Facilities
QualTek’s headquarters are located in an approximately 39,000 square foot facility that we lease in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. Our lease of this facility expires in 2031, and we have the option to extend the lease for an additional five-year period. QualTek has properties related to its operations in approximately 80 locations. QualTek’s management believes that its properties have been well maintained, are in good condition, and are adequate to meet our current needs.
Human Capital Resources
Our employees are critical to our success. In order to best service our customers, QualTek utilizes a hybrid in-house & contracted labor model to flex our workforce in real-time. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a workforce of approximately 840 in the Midwest, 1,450 in the West, 600 in the Southwest, 820 in the Southeast, and 1,515 in the Northeast. The Northeast workforce included approximately 100 corporate employees that support all regions. Our executive leadership team averages over 25 years of industry or functional experience. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing.
Government Regulations
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection. While many of our customers operate in regulated industries (for example, utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight.
In addition to environmental laws and regulations, as a contractor, our operations are subject to various laws, including:

· | regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state equivalents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13




· | regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | contractor licensing requirements;
--+-----------------------------------


· | permitting and inspection requirements; and
--+--------------------------------------------


· | building and electrical codes.
--+-------------------------------

We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and programs, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, laws governing emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil, and programs related to the protection of endangered species and critical habitats.
We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business.
In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. Our contracts with customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. From time to time, we may incur unanticipated and substantial costs and obligations related to environmental compliance and/or remediation matters.
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory and environmental requirements. We could, however, incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with such requirements.
The potential effects of climate change on our operations is highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather. Therefore, major changes in weather patterns could have a significant effect on our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability. Climate change could also affect our customers and the projects that they award. Demand for power projects or other projects could be negatively affected by significant changes in weather or from legislation or regulations governing climate change.
Legal Proceedings
We are from time to time subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties, and could result in damages, fines, penalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. We recognize provisions for claims or pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates.
