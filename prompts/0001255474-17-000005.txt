 Item 1.        Business
 Overview
 We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in development, production, acquisition and exploration activities primarily in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States.  We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2003 in connection with our initial public offering.
 Since our inception, we have built a strong asset base through a combination of property acquisitions, development of proved reserves and exploration activities.  Our current operations and capital programs are focused on organic drilling opportunities and on the development of previously acquired properties, specifically on projects that we believe provide the greatest potential for repeatable success and production growth, while selectively pursuing acquisitions that complement our existing core properties, such as the acquisition of Kodiak Oil & Gas Corp. (the “Kodiak Acquisition”) discussed in the “Acquisitions and Divestitures” footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. As a result of lower crude oil prices during 2015 and 2016, we significantly reduced our level of capital spending to more closely align with our cash flows generated from operations, and have focused our drilling activity on projects that provide the highest rate of return.  In addition, we continually evaluate our property portfolio and sell properties when we believe that the sales price realized will provide an above average rate of return for the property or when the property no longer matches the profile of properties we desire to own, such as the asset sales discussed below under “Acquisitions and Divestitures”.
 As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved reserves totaled 615.5 MMBOE and our 2016 average daily production was 129.9 MBOE/d, which results in an average reserve life of approximately 12.9 years.
 The following table summarizes by core area, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, their corresponding pre-tax PV10% values, and our fourth quarter 2016 average daily production rates, as well as our company’s total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2016:

(1) | Oil and gas reserve quantities and related discounted future net cash flows have been derived from an oil price of $42.75 per Bbl and a gas price of $2.49 per MMBtu, which were calculated using an average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month within the 12 months ended December 31, 2016 as required by current SEC and FASB guidelines.

(2) | Pre-tax PV10% may be considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC and is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (the “Standardized Measure”), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV10% is computed on the same basis as the Standardized Measure but without deducting future income taxes. We believe pre-tax PV10% is a useful measure for investors when evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We further believe investors may utilize our pre-tax PV10% as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other companies because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Our management uses this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and gas properties and acquisitions. However, pre-tax PV10% is not a substitute for the 5

Standardized Measure. Our pre-tax PV10% and Standardized Measure do not purport to present the fair value of our proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves.

  During 2016, we incurred $554 million in exploration and development (“E&D”) expenditures, including $504 million for the drilling of 89 gross (48.2 net) wells.  All of these new wells resulted in productive completions.
 Our current 2017 E&D budget is $1.1 billion, which we expect to fund substantially with net cash provided by our operating activities, proceeds from property divestitures, cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facility or by accessing the capital markets. To the extent net cash provided by operating activities is higher or lower than currently anticipated, we would adjust our E&D budget accordingly, enter into agreements with industry partners, divest certain oil and gas property interests, adjust borrowings outstanding under our credit facility or access the capital markets as necessary.
 Acquisitions and Divestitures
 During 2015 and 2016, in response to sustained lower crude oil prices, we divested of a large number of non-core oil and gas properties that no longer matched the profile of properties we desire to own.  In addition, in January 2017 we closed on the sale of our interests in two gas processing plants located in the Williston Basin for aggregate sales proceeds of $375 million.  Refer to the “Subsequent Events” footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on this transaction.  Our significant acquisitions and divestitures during the last two years are summarized below.
 Acquisitions.  There were no significant acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 2016 Divestitures. In July 2016, we completed the sale of our interest in our enhanced oil recovery project in the North Ward Estes field in Ward and Winkler counties of Texas, including our interest in certain CO2 properties in the McElmo Dome field in Colorado and certain other related assets and liabilities (the “North Ward Estes Properties”) for a cash purchase price of $300 million (before closing adjustments).  The sale was effective July 1, 2016 and resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $187 million.  In addition to the cash purchase price, the buyer has agreed to pay us $100,000 for every $0.01 that, as of June 28, 2018, the average NYMEX crude oil futures contract price for each month from August 2018 through July 2021 is above $50.00/Bbl up to a maximum amount of $100 million (the “Contingent Payment”).  The Contingent Payment will be made at the option of the buyer either in cash on July 31, 2018 or in the form of a secured promissory note, accruing interest at 8% per annum with a maturity date of July 29, 2022.  The North Ward Estes Properties consisted of estimated proved reserves of 120.3 MMBOE as of December 31, 2015, representing 15% of our proved reserves as of that date, and generated 8.6 MBOE/d (or 6%) of our June 2016 average daily net production.
 2015 Divestitures. In December 2015, we completed the sale of a fresh water delivery system, a produced water gathering system and four saltwater disposal wells located in Weld County, Colorado, effective December 16, 2015, for aggregate sales proceeds of $75 million (before closing adjustments).
 In June 2015, we completed the sale of our interests in certain non-core oil and gas wells, effective June 1, 2015, for aggregate sales proceeds of $150 million (before closing adjustments) resulting in a pre-tax loss on sale of $118 million.  The properties included over 2,000 gross wells in 132 fields across 10 states.  The properties had estimated proved reserves of 20.9 MMBOE as of December 31, 2014, representing 3% of our proved reserves as of that date, and generated 5.3 MBOE/d (or 3%) of our May 2015 average daily production.
 In April 2015, we completed the sale of our interests in certain non-core oil and gas wells, effective May 1, 2015, for aggregate sales proceeds of $108 million (before closing adjustments) resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $29 million.  The properties are located in 187 fields across 14 states, and predominately consisted of assets that were previously included in the underlying properties of Whiting USA Trust I.  The properties had estimated proved reserves of 8.9 MMBOE as of December 31, 2014, representing 1% of our total proved reserves as of that date, and generated 2.7 MBOE/d (or 2%) of our March 2015 average daily net production.

Also during the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed several immaterial divestiture transactions for the sale of our interests in certain non-core oil and gas wells and undeveloped acreage, for aggregate sales proceeds of $176 million (before closing adjustments) resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $28 million.  These properties had estimated proved reserves of 23.4 MMBOE as of December 31, 2014, representing 3% of our total proved reserves as of that date.  The properties generated a combined total of approximately 4.4 MBOE/d of average daily net production, based on production rates at each of the respective closing dates.
 Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to generate meaningful growth in shareholder value through the development, acquisition and exploration of oil and gas projects with attractive rates of return on capital.  Specifically, we have focused, and plan to continue to focus, on the following:
 Developing Existing Properties.  The development of large resource plays such as our Williston Basin and Denver Julesburg Basin (“DJ Basin”) projects has become one of our central objectives.  As of December 31, 2016, we have assembled approximately 736,000 gross (443,800 net) developed and undeveloped acres in the Williston Basin located in North Dakota and Montana.  As of December 31, 2016, we had four drilling rigs operating in this area. During 2016, we entered into two separate wellbore participation agreements related to wells drilled in the Williston Basin, which helped allow us to continue completion activity in this area.
 At our Redtail field in the DJ Basin in Weld County, Colorado, we have assembled approximately 157,200 gross (132,200 net) developed and undeveloped acres.  As of December 31, 2016, we had one drilling rig operating in the DJ Basin.  We suspended completion operations in this area beginning in the second quarter of 2016; however, we plan to resume completion activity in early 2017. Our Redtail gas plant processes the associated gas produced from our wells in this area, and has a current inlet capacity of 50 MMcf/d.
 Disciplined Financial Approach. Our goal is to remain financially strong, yet flexible, through the prudent management of our balance sheet and active management of our exposure to commodity price volatility.  We have historically funded our acquisition and growth activity through a combination of equity and debt issuances, bank borrowings, internally generated cash flows and certain oil and gas property divestitures, as appropriate, to maintain our financial position.  As a result of sustained lower crude oil prices in 2015 and 2016, we significantly reduced our level of capital spending to more closely align with our cash flows generated from operations, and have focused our drilling activity on projects that provide the highest rate of return.  From time to time, we monetize non-core properties and use the net proceeds from these asset sales to repay debt under our credit agreement or fund our E&D expenditures.  For example, during 2015 and 2016 we sold a large number of non-core oil and gas properties that no longer matched the profile of properties we desire to own.  In addition, to support cash flow generation on our existing properties and help ensure expected cash flows from newly acquired properties, we periodically enter into derivative contracts.  Typically, we use costless collars, swaps and crude oil sales and delivery contracts to provide an attractive base commodity price level. As of January 3, 2017, we had derivative contracts covering the sale of approximately 49% of our forecasted 2017 oil production.
 Growing Through Accretive Acquisitions.  Since 2003, we have completed 21 separate significant acquisitions of producing properties for total estimated proved reserves of 445.2 MMBOE, as of the effective dates of the acquisitions.  Our experienced team of management, land, engineering and geoscience professionals has developed and refined an acquisition program designed to increase reserves and complement our existing properties, including identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities, closing purchases and effectively managing the properties we acquire.  We intend to selectively pursue the acquisition of properties that are complementary to our core operating areas, such as the Kodiak Acquisition, which closed in 2014 and significantly expanded our presence in the Williston Basin.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that our key competitive strengths lie in our focused asset portfolio, our experienced management and technical teams and our commitment to the effective application of new technologies.
 Focused, Long-Lived Asset Base.  As of December 31, 2016, we had interests in 4,687 gross (1,917 net) productive wells on approximately 849,300 gross (517,200 net) developed acres across our geographical areas.  We believe the concentration of our operated assets presents us with multiple opportunities to successfully execute our business strategy by enabling us to leverage our technical expertise and take advantage of operational efficiencies.  Our proved reserve life is approximately 12.9 years based on year-end 2016 proved reserves and 2016 production.
 Experienced Management and Technical Teams.  Our management team averages 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry.  Our personnel have extensive experience in each of our core geographical areas and in all of our operational disciplines.  In addition, our team of acquisition professionals has an average of 33 years of experience in the evaluation, acquisition and operational assimilation of oil and gas properties.

Commitment to Technology.  In each of our core operating areas, we have accumulated extensive geologic and geophysical knowledge and have developed significant technical and operational expertise.  In recent years, we have developed considerable expertise in conventional and 3-D seismic imaging and interpretation.  Data provided by our in-house, state-of-the-art rock analysis laboratory is used to support real-time drilling and completion decisions, and to help us further understand unconventional oil plays.  Our technical team has access to approximately 9,400 square miles of 3-D seismic data, digital well logs and other subsurface information.  This data is analyzed with advanced geophysical and geological computer resources dedicated to the accurate and efficient characterization of the subsurface oil and gas reservoirs that comprise our asset base.  In addition, our information systems enable us to update our production databases through daily uploads from hand-held computers in the field.  This commitment to technology has increased the productivity and efficiency of our field operations and development activities.
 We continue to advance our completion techniques, including significantly increasing proppant volumes, utilizing diverter agents to better distribute fluid and proppant across individual zones, varying the number of completion stages, and employing new fracture stimulation fluids, including slickwater.  We plan to continue use of these state-of-the-art completion designs on wells we drill throughout 2017, while also testing new diversion technology and more efficient placement and drillout of down-hole plugs.

Marketing and Major Customers
 We principally sell our oil and gas production to end users, marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline facilities.  In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is trucked or transported by rail to terminals, market hubs, refineries or storage facilities.  The tables below present percentages by purchaser that accounted for 10% or more of our total oil, NGL and natural gas sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, no individual purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our total oil, NGL and natural gas sales.  We believe that the loss of any individual purchaser would not have a long-term material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations, as alternative customers and markets for the sale of our products are readily available in the areas in which we operate.

 Title to Properties
 Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens securing indebtedness, liens incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens, including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions.  Our credit agreement is also collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of our assets.  We do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with the use of our properties or the operation of our business.
 We believe that we have satisfactory rights or title to all of our producing properties.  As is customary in the oil and gas industry, limited investigation of title is made at the time of acquisition of undeveloped properties.  In most cases, we investigate title and obtain title opinions from counsel only when we acquire producing properties or before commencement of drilling operations.
 Competition
 The oil and gas industry is a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, obtaining investment capital, securing oil field goods and services, marketing oil and natural gas products and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate.  Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our resources permit.  In addition, the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs or other equipment and services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations.  Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Regulation
 Regulation of Production 
 The production of oil and gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations.  Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and periodic report submittals during operations.  All of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of well spacing and the plugging and abandonment of wells.  The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations that we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing.  Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production or sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas within its jurisdiction.
 Currently, none of our total production volumes are produced from offshore leases, however, some of our prior offshore operations were conducted on federal leases that are administered by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the “BOEM”).  The present value of our future abandonment obligations associated with offshore properties was $38 million as of December 31, 2016.  We are therefore required to comply with the regulations and orders issued by the BOEM under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

Among other things, we are required to obtain prior BOEM approval for any exploration plans we pursue and for our lease development and production plans.  BOEM regulations also establish construction requirements for production facilities located on our federal offshore leases and govern the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal of production facilities from these leases.
 The BOEM also establishes the basis for royalty payments due under federal oil and gas leases through regulations issued under applicable statutory authority.  State regulatory authorities establish similar standards for royalty payments due under state oil and gas leases.  The basis for royalty payments established by the BOEM and the state regulatory authorities is generally applicable to all federal and state oil and gas lessees.  Accordingly, we believe that the impact of royalty regulation on our operations should generally be the same as the impact on our competitors.
 Regulation of Sale and Transportation of Oil 
 Sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices, however, Congress could reenact price controls or enact other legislation in the future.
 Our crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation.  The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act.  In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances.  Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for crude oil transportation rates that allowed for an increase or decrease in the cost of transporting oil to the purchaser.  The FERC’s regulations include a methodology for oil pipelines to change their rates through the use of an index system that establishes ceiling levels for such rates.  The most recent mandatory five-year review period resulted in an order from the FERC for the index to be based on Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (the “PPI-FG”) plus a 1.23% adjustment for the five-year period from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2021.  This represents a decrease from the PPI-FG plus 2.65% adjustment from the prior five-year period.  The FERC determined that it would now use a calculation based on what it determined to be a superior data source, reflecting actual cost-of-service data as opposed to the accounting data historically used as a proxy for such information under the prior index methodology.  The regulations provide that each year the Commission will publish the oil pipeline index after the PPI-FG becomes available.  Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions.  The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state.  Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
 Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis.  Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates.  When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs.  In addition, the FERC has emergency authority under the Interstate Commerce Act to intervene and direct priority use of oil pipeline transportation capacity, and the FERC exercised this authority over a specific pipeline in February 2014 in response to significant disruptions in the supply of propane.  Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.
 Public protests and media attention related to permitting and construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation may attract additional attention to oil pipeline operations and regulation.  We do not expect any resulting impacts to oil pipeline transportation would affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
 Transportation and safety of oil and hazardous liquid is subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) under the Pipeline Integrity, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2012.  The Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency within the DOT, enforces regulations on all interstate liquids transportation and some intrastate liquids transportation.  PHMSA does not enforce the regulations in states that are capable of enforcing the same regulations themselves.  The effect of regulatory changes under the DOT and their effect on interstate and intrastate oil and hazardous liquid transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
 A portion of our crude oil production may be shipped to market centers using rail transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties.  The DOT and PHMSA establish safety regulations relating to crude-by-rail transportation.  In addition, third-party rail operators are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board of the DOT, the Federal Railroad Administration (the “FRA”) of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal regulatory agencies.  Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.

In response to rail accidents occurring between 2002 and 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the Rail Safety and Improvement Act of 2008, which implemented regulations governing different areas related to railroad safety.  In response to train derailments occurring in the United States and Canada in 2013 and 2014, U.S. regulators have taken a number of actions to address the safety risks of transporting crude oil by rail.
 In February 2014, the DOT issued an emergency order requiring all persons to ensure crude oil is properly tested and classed prior to offering such product into transportation, and to assure all shipments by rail of crude oil be handled as a Packing Group I or II hazardous material.  Also in February 2014, the Association of American Railroads entered into a voluntary agreement with the DOT to implement certain restrictions around the movement of crude oil by rail.  In May 2014 (and extended indefinitely in May 2015), the DOT issued an Emergency Restriction/Prohibition Order requiring each railroad carrier operating trains transporting 1,000,000 gallons or more of Bakken crude oil to provide notice to state officials regarding the expected movement of the trains through the counties in each state.  The PHMSA and FRA have also issued safety advisories and alerts regarding oil transportation and have issued a report focused on the increased volatility and flammability of Bakken crude oil as compared with other crudes in the U.S.  In May 2015, PHMSA issued new rules applicable to “high-hazard flammable trains”, defined as a continuous block of 20 or more tank cars loaded with a flammable liquid or 35 or more tank cars loaded with a flammable liquid dispersed throughout a train.  Among other requirements, the new rules require enhanced braking systems, enhanced standards for newly constructed tank cars and retrofitting of existing tank cars, restricted operating speeds, a documented testing and sampling program, and routine assessments that evaluate 27 safety and security factors.  In December 2015, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (“FAST”) Act became law, further extending PHMSA’s authority to improve the safety of transporting flammable liquids by rail and pursuant to which new regulations phasing out the use of certain older rail cars were finalized in August 2016.  In June 2016, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (“PIPES”) Act of 2016 became law.  The PIPES Act strengthens PHMSA’s safety authority, including an expansion of its ability to issue emergency orders, which were adopted by rule in October 2016.  PHMSA continues to review further potential new safety regulations under the PIPES Act and the FAST Act.
 We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars.  However, the adoption of any regulations that impact the testing or rail transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at favorable prices at market centers throughout the U.S., the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The effect of any such regulatory changes will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
 Regulation of Transportation, Storage, Sale and Gathering of Natural Gas
 The FERC regulates the transportation, and to a lesser extent, the sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those Acts.  In 1989, however, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993.  While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at unregulated market prices, in the future Congress could reenact price controls or enact other legislation with detrimental impact on many aspects of our business.
 Our natural gas sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation.  The price and terms of access to pipeline transportation and underground storage are subject to extensive federal and state regulation.  From 1985 to the present, several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales.  In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry that remain subject to the FERC's jurisdiction, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies and certain underground storage facilities.  These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances.  The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry by making natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis.
 The FERC implements the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act pertaining to transportation and pipeline issues, which requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf provide open access and non-discriminatory transportation service.  One of the FERC’s principal goals in carrying out this Act’s mandate is to increase transparency in the market to provide producers and shippers on the outer continental shelf with greater assurance of open access services on pipelines located on the outer continental shelf and non-discriminatory rates and conditions of service on such pipelines.
 We cannot accurately predict whether the FERC’s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in the markets in which our natural gas is sold.  Regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum product pipelines.  In addition, the natural gas industry historically has always been heavily regulated.  Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue.  However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers.

Transportation and safety of natural gas is subject to regulation by the DOT under the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2012.  In addition, intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to enforcement by state regulatory agencies and PHMSA enforces regulations on interstate natural gas transportation.  State regulatory agencies can also create their own transportation and safety regulations as long as they meet PHMSA’s minimum requirements.  The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state.  Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any of the states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.  Likewise, the effect of regulatory changes by the DOT and their effect on interstate natural gas transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
 The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties.  We use the latest tools and technologies to remain compliant with current pipeline safety regulations.
 In October 2015, a failure at an underground natural gas storage facility in Southern California prompted PHMSA to issue an advisory bulletin reminding owners and operators of underground storage facilities to review operations, identify the potential for facility leaks and failures, and to review and update emergency plans.  The State of California proclaimed the underground natural gas storage facility an emergency situation in January 2016.  A federal task force was also convened to make recommendations to help avoid such failures.  An interim final rule of PHMSA became effective in January 2017 addressing design issues for underground storage facilities, including wells, wellbore tubing and casing.  Any further increased attention to and requirements for underground storage safety and infrastructure by state and federal regulators that may result from this incident will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers.
 Environmental Regulations 
 General.  Our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge or release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection.  Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or that may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply.  These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or facility construction commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit project siting, construction or drilling activities on certain lands located within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas; require remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits; and impose substantial liabilities for unauthorized pollution resulting from our operations.  The EPA and analogous state agencies may delay or refuse the issuance of required permits or otherwise include onerous or limiting permit conditions that may have a significant adverse impact on our ability to conduct operations.  The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability.
 Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly material handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general.  While we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future.
 President Trump has indicated that he would work to ease regulatory burdens on industry and on the oil and gas sector, including environmental regulations.  However, any executive orders the President may issue or any new legislation Congress may pass with the goal of reducing environmental statutory or regulatory requirements may be challenged in court.  In addition, various state laws and regulations (and permits issued thereunder) will be unaffected by federal changes unless and until the state laws and corresponding permits are similarly changed, and any judicial review is completed.
 The environmental laws and regulations which have the most significant impact on the oil and gas exploration and production industry are as follows:
 Superfund.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”), and comparable state laws impose strict joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of the site where a release occurred and anyone who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance released at the site.  Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the 

 

12

 

costs of certain health studies. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.  In the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate material that may be regulated as “hazardous substances”. Consequently, we may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA or comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites where these materials have been disposed or released.
 We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned or leased, properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas.  Although we and our predecessors have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal.  In addition, many of these owned and leased properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons were not under our control.  Similarly, the disposal facilities where discarded materials are sent are also often operated by third parties whose waste treatment and disposal practices may not be adequate.  While we only use what we consider to be reputable disposal facilities, we might not know of a potential problem if the disposal occurred before we acquired the property or business, and if the problem itself is not discovered until years later.  Our properties, adjacent affected properties, offsite disposal facilities and substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA and analogous state laws.  Under these laws, we could be required:

· | to remove or remediate previously disposed materials, including materials disposed or released by prior owners or operators or other third parties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | to clean up contaminated property, including contaminated groundwater;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination, including the plugging and abandonment of wells drilled and left inactive by prior owners and operators; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | to pay some or all of the costs of any such action.
--+----------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 At this time, we do not believe that we are a potentially responsible party with respect to any Superfund site and we have not been notified of any claim, liability or damages under CERCLA.
 Oil Pollution Act.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) and regulations issued under OPA impose strict, joint and several liability on “responsible parties” for removal costs and damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States.  A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility and the lessee, permittee or holder of a right of use and easement of the area in which an offshore facility is located.  OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities of $350 million per spill, while the liability limit for offshore facilities is the payment of all removal costs plus $75 million per spill damages.  These limits do not apply if the spill is caused by a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from a responsible party’s violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; a responsible party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a cleanup; or a responsible party fails to comply with an order issued under the authority of the Intervention on the High Seas Act.  OPA also requires the lessee or permittee of the offshore area in which a covered offshore facility is located to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of $35 million to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such responsible party is statutorily responsible.  The President may increase the amount of financial responsibility required under OPA by up to $150 million, depending on the risk represented by the quantity or quality of oil that is handled by the facility.  Any failure to comply with OPA’s requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to administrative penalties up to $25,000 per day per violation.  We believe we are in compliance with all applicable OPA financial responsibility obligations.  Moreover, we are not aware of any action or event that would subject us to liability under OPA, and we believe that compliance with OPA’s financial responsibility and other operating requirements will not have a material adverse effect on us.
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.  Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements. We generate solid and hazardous wastes that are subject to RCRA and comparable state laws.  Drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions.  However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous waste in the future. In September 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a petition with the EPA, requesting them to reconsider the RCRA exemption for exploration, production and development wastes.  In May 2016, several environmental groups sued the EPA for failing to update its rules for management of oil and gas drilling waste under RCRA.  The petitioners requested that the EPA revise its regulations for waste materials generated as a result of oil and gas exploration and production activities.  The petitioners claimed that the EPA has not reviewed or revised its regulations for management of wastes from oil and gas exploration and production operations since 1988, even though the statute requires the EPA to review and, if necessary, revise the regulations every three years.  In December 2016, the court entered a Consent Decree resolving the litigation.  Under the Consent Decree, the EPA has agreed to propose no later than March 15, 2019 a rulemaking for revision of the regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a 

 

13

 

determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary.  In the event that the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any such change in the current RCRA exemption and comparable state laws could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes.  Additionally, these exploration and production wastes may be regulated by state agencies as solid waste.  Also, ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste.  Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our materials constituting wastes (as they are presently classified) to be significant, any repeal or modification of the oil and gas exploration and production exemption by administrative, legislative or judicial process, or modification of similar exemptions in analogous state statutes would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur increased operating expenses.
 Clean Water Act.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, as amended (“CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or other waters of the United States.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency.  Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak.  In addition, CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.
 The EPA had regulations under the authority of CWA that required certain oil and gas exploration and production projects to obtain permits for construction projects with storm water discharges.  However, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 nullified most of the EPA regulations that required storm water permitting of oil and gas construction projects.  There are still some state and federal rules that regulate the discharge of storm water from some oil and gas construction projects. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater and/or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans.  Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. In Section 40 CFR 112 of the regulations, the EPA promulgated the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure regulations, which require certain oil containing facilities to prepare plans and meet construction and operating standards.
 Air Emissions.  The Federal Clean Air Act, as amended (the “CAA”), and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants from various industrial sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose other monitoring and reporting requirements.  We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining pre-construction and operating permits and approvals for air emissions.  In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources.  For example, in 2012, the EPA finalized rules establishing new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production operations.  Specifically, the EPA’s rule includes New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. Among other things, these standards require the application of reduced emission completion techniques associated with the completion of newly drilled and fractured wells in addition to existing wells that are refractured.  The rules also establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment.  These rules could require a number of modifications to operations at certain of our oil and gas properties including the installation of new equipment.  Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our business.  Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.
 The EPA announced in 2015 that it would directly regulate methane emissions from oil and natural gas wells for the first time as part of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan.  As part of this strategy, in May 2016, the EPA issued three final rules.  The EPA issued a final rule that updated the New Source Performance Standards to add requirements that the oil and gas industry reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to cover additional equipment and activities in the oil and gas production chain.  The final rule sets emissions limits for methane, which is the principal greenhouse gas emitted by equipment and processes in the oil and gas sector.  This rule applies to new, reconstructed and modified processes and equipment.  This rule also expands the volatile organic compound emissions limits to hydraulically fractured oil wells and equipment used across the industry that was not regulated in the 2012 rules.  The rule also requires owners and operators to find and repair leaks, also known as “fugitive emissions.”  The EPA also issued a final rule known as the Source Determination Rule, which is intended to clarify when multiple pieces of equipment and activities in the oil and gas industry must be deemed a single source when determining whether major source permitting programs apply under the prevention of significant deterioration, nonattainment new source review preconstruction and operation permit programs under Title V of the CAA (“Title V”).  The final rule defines the term “adjacent” to clarify that equipment and activities in the oil and gas sector that are under common control will be considered part of the same source if they are located near each other – specifically, if they are located on the same site, or on sites that share equipment and are within one quarter of a mile of each other.  This rule applies to equipment and activities used for onshore oil and natural gas production, and for natural gas processing.  It does not apply to offshore operations.

Finally, the EPA also issued a final Federal Implementation Plan (“FIP”) for Indian country, which implements the minor new source review program in Indian country for oil and natural gas production.  The FIP will be used instead of site-specific minor new source review preconstruction permits in Indian country and incorporates emissions limits and other requirements from eight federal air standards, including the final New Source Performance Standard.  Requirements of the FIP apply throughout Indian country, except non-reservation areas, unless a tribe or the EPA demonstrates jurisdiction for those areas.
 Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our business.  Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.
 In 2016, the EPA also issued the first draft of an Information Collection Request, seeking a broad range of information on the oil and gas industry, including: how equipment and emissions controls are, or can be, configured, what installing those controls entails and the associated costs.  This includes information on natural gas venting that occurs as part of existing processes or maintenance activities, such as well and pipeline blowdowns, equipment malfunctions and flashing emissions from storage tanks.
 After the closing of the Kodiak Acquisition, the EPA contacted us to discuss Kodiak’s responses to a June 2014 information request from the EPA under Section 114(a) of the CAA.  In addition, in July 2015 and March 2016, we received information requests from the EPA under Section 114(a) of the CAA.  The information requests relate to tank batteries used in our Williston Basin operations and our compliance with certain regulatory requirements at those locations for the control of air pollutant emissions from those facilities.  We have responded to the EPA’s July 2015 and March 2016 information requests, and such responses were also provided to the North Dakota Department of Health (the “NDDoH”), with whom the EPA was coordinating in making the requests.  The EPA has sole authority to enforce CAA violations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, and, to date, no formal federal enforcement action has been commenced in connection with this matter for our North Dakota tribal properties beyond receipt of the noted information requests.  We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of possible federal enforcement with respect to our North Dakota tribal properties, or other exclusively federal requirements at any of our North Dakota properties, at this time, which could result in civil penalties or require us to undertake corrective actions, or both.
 In connection with the above EPA inquiries, in October 2016, the NDDoH concurrently filed in the North Dakota District Court for Burleigh County (the “Court”) a complaint against, and a settlement with, us regarding tank operation and other inspection-related alleged violations of North Dakota’s air pollution control laws.  In November 2016, the Court issued its order accepting this settlement as its final judgment to resolve the issues raised in the complaint.  This settlement addresses approximately 94 percent of our North Dakota properties but does not address our North Dakota tribal property operations or exclusively federal requirements applicable to all of our North Dakota properties, which are governed by the EPA.  In the settlement, we and a significant number of North Dakota operators have worked with the NDDoH to develop inspection and repair measures to detect and prevent emissions from facilities even more effectively going forward.  We believe these measures will be included in settlements between the NDDoH and each participating operator.  We and the NDDoH, pending Court approval of the settlement, have agreed that we will pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million, of which $1.1 million may be reduced by up to 60 percent by early and continued implementation of the aforementioned inspection and repair measures and a quality control policy.  We anticipate being able to qualify for all available penalty reductions.  The settlement is not an admission by us of any violation.
 Hydraulic Fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight rock formations.  The process involves the injection of mainly water and sand plus a de minimis amount of chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.  Hydraulic fracturing has been utilized to complete wells in our most active areas located in the states of Colorado, Montana and North Dakota, and we expect it will also be used in the future.  Should our exploration and production activities expand to other states, it is likely that we will utilize hydraulic fracturing to complete or recomplete wells in those areas.  The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions.  However, the EPA also issued guidance in 2014 for permitting authorities and the industry regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel.
 In December 2016, the EPA released a final report on the potential impacts of oil and gas fracturing activities on the quality and quantity of drinking water resources in the United States. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule promulgating pretreatment standards for the oil and gas extraction category which would address discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works.  The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater.  The EPA is collecting data and information regarding the extent to which these facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of the facilities, the environmental impacts of discharges and other information.
 Other federal agencies are also examining hydraulic fracturing, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the White House Council for Environmental Quality.  In March 2015, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a final rule addressing (i) hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian oil and natural gas leases to require validation of well integrity and strong cement barriers between the wellbore and water zones through which the wellbore passes, (ii) disclosure of 

 

15

 

chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing to the Bureau of Land Management, (iii) higher standards for interim storage of recovered waste fluids from hydraulic fracturing, and (iv) measures to lower the risk of cross-well contamination with chemicals and fluids used in fracturing operations. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process.  Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could ban, restrict or impose additional requirements on activities relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances.  For example, in June 2011, Texas enacted a law that requires the disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process to the Railroad Commission of Texas (the entity that regulates oil and natural gas production in Texas) and the public.  Such federal or state legislation could require the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities who could then make such information publicly available.  Disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing hydraulic fracturing to pursue legal proceedings against producers and service providers based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect human health or the environment, including groundwater.  In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays, litigation risk and potential increases in costs.  Further, local governments may seek to adopt, and some have adopted, ordinances within their jurisdictions restricting the use of or regulating the time, place and manner of drilling or hydraulic fracturing.  No assurance can be given as to whether or not similar measures might be considered or implemented in the jurisdictions in which our properties are located.  If new laws, regulations or ordinances that significantly restrict or otherwise impact hydraulic fracturing are passed by Congress or adopted in the states or local municipalities where our properties are located, such legal requirements could prohibit or make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby could affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable.  In addition, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercially paying quantities and the calculation of our reserves.
 In addition, in July 2014, a major university and U.S. Geological Survey researchers published a study purporting to find a causal connection between the deep well injection of hydraulic fracturing wastewater and a sharp increase in seismic activity in Oklahoma since 2008.  This study, as well as subsequent studies and reports, may trigger new legislation or regulations that would limit or ban the disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in deep injection wells.  If such new laws or rules are adopted, our operations may be curtailed while alternative treatment and disposal methods are developed and approved.
 Further, in May 2014, the EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to the disclosure of chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production.  Depending on the precise disclosure requirements the EPA elects to impose, if any, we may be obliged to disclose valuable proprietary information, and failure to do so may subject us to penalties.
 Global Warming and Climate Change.  In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climate changes.  Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations that restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA, including rules that limit emissions of GHG from motor vehicles beginning with the 2012 model year.  The EPA has asserted that these final motor vehicle GHG emission standards trigger the CAA construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources, commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect in January 2011.  In June 2010, the EPA published its final rule to address the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (the “PSD”) and Title V permitting programs.  This rule “tailors” these permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first becoming subject to permitting.  Further, facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions are required to reduce those emissions consistent with guidance for determining “best available control technology” standards for GHG, which guidance was published by the EPA in November 2010.  Also in November 2010, the EPA expanded its existing GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities.  This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis.  We believe that we are in compliance with all substantial applicable emissions requirements.
 In June 2014, the Supreme Court upheld most of the EPA’s GHG permitting requirements, allowing the agency to regulate the emission of GHG from stationary sources already subject to the PSD and Title V requirements.  Certain of our equipment and installations may currently be subject to PSD and Title V requirements and hence, under the Supreme Court’s ruling, may also be subject to the installation of controls to capture GHG.  For any equipment or installation so subject, we may have to incur increased compliance costs to capture related GHG emissions.
 In October 2016, the EPA proposed revisions to the rule applicable to GHGs for PSD and Title V permitting requirements.  The proposed rule has not been finalized.
 In accordance with President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, in August 2015, the EPA issued a rule to reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units.  The rule, commonly called the “Clean Power Plan”, requires states to develop plans to reduce carbon 

 

16

 

emissions from fossil fuel-fired generating units commencing in 2022, with the reductions to be fully phased in by 2030.  Each state is given a different carbon reduction target, but the EPA expects that, in the aggregate, the overall proposal will reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units by 32% from 2005 levels.  States are given substantial flexibility in meeting their emission reduction targets and can generally choose to lower carbon emissions by replacing higher carbon generation, such as coal or natural gas, with lower carbon generation, such as efficient natural gas units or renewable energy alternatives.  Several industry groups and states have challenged the Clean Power Plan in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and in February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while it is being challenged in court.  The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments on the Clean Power Plan in September 2016, but has not yet issued a decision.  President Trump has indicated that he is opposed to the Clean Power Plan, and the new administration could withdraw the rule and potentially repropose it, or seek to invalidate the EPA’s prior determination that GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment.  Either action is likely to be challenged in court, which could delay implementation of any new rules.
 In addition, both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHG, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHG, primarily through the development of GHG inventories, GHG permitting and/or regional GHG “cap and trade” programs.  Most of these “cap and trade” programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved.  In the absence of new legislation, the EPA is issuing new regulations that limit emissions of GHG associated with our operations, which will require us to incur costs to inventory and reduce emissions of GHG associated with our operations and which could adversely affect demand for the oil, NGLs and natural gas that we produce.  Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events.  If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
 Consideration of Environmental Issues in Connection with Governmental Approvals.  Our operations frequently require licenses, permits and/or other governmental approvals.  Several federal statutes, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”), the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) and the Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”), require federal agencies to evaluate environmental issues in connection with granting such approvals and/or taking other major agency actions.  OCSLA, for instance, requires the U.S. Department of Interior to evaluate whether certain proposed activities would cause serious harm or damage to the marine, coastal or human environment.  Similarly, NEPA requires the Department of Interior and other federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment.  In the course of such evaluations, an agency would have to prepare an environmental assessment and potentially an environmental impact statement.  The CZMA, on the other hand, aids states in developing a coastal management program to protect the coastal environment from growing demands associated with various uses, including offshore oil and gas development.  In obtaining various approvals from the Department of Interior, we must certify that we will conduct our activities in a manner consistent with all applicable regulations.
