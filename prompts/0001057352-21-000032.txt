Item 1.    Business
In this report, the words “we,” “our,” “us,” “CoStar” or the “Company” refer to CoStar Group, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. This report also refers to our websites, but information contained on those sites is not part of this report.
CoStar Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, founded in 1987, is the number one provider of information, analytics and online marketplaces to the commercial real estate industry in the United States (“U.S.”) and United Kingdom (“U.K.”) based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available; have the largest research department in the industry; own and operate leading online marketplaces for commercial real estate and apartment listings in the U.S. based on the numbers of unique visitors and site visits per month; and provide more information, analytics and marketing services than any of our competitors. We have created and compiled a standardized platform of information, analytics and online marketplace services where industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate, including apartments, and the related business communities, can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently accessing and exchanging accurate and standardized real estate-related information. Our service offerings span all commercial property types, including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, commercial land, mixed-use and hospitality. With our recent acquisition of Homesnap, Inc., (“Homesnap”) we also offer an online mobile software platform for residential real estate agents and brokers.
We manage our business geographically in two operating segments, with our primary areas of measurement and decision-making being North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, and International, which primarily includes Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. On October 22, 2019, we acquired STR, Inc. and STR Global, Ltd. (together with STR, Inc., "STR"), which provides benchmarking and analytics for the hospitality industry. On June 24, 2020, we acquired Ten-X Holding Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Ten-X"), which operate an online auction platform for commercial real estate. On October 26, 2020, we acquired Emporis GmbH, a Germany-based provider of international commercial real estate data and images, and on December 22, 2020, we acquired Homesnap. See Notes 5 and 9 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the Homesnap acquisition.
Strategy
Our strategy is to provide real estate industry professionals and consumers with critical knowledge to explore and complete transactions by offering the most comprehensive, timely and standardized information on real estate and the right tools to be able to effectively utilize that information. Over time, we have expanded, and we continue to expand, our services for real estate information, analytics and online marketplaces in an effort to continue to meet the needs of the industry as it grows and evolves.
Our standardized platform includes the most comprehensive proprietary database of commercial real estate information in the industry; the largest research department in the industry; proprietary data collection, information management and quality control systems; a large in-house product development team; a broad suite of web-based information, analytics and online marketplace services; a large team of analysts and economists; and a large, diverse base of clients. Our database has been developed and enhanced for more than 30 years by a research department that makes thousands of daily database updates. In addition to our internal efforts to grow the database, we have obtained and assimilated a significant number of proprietary databases. Our comprehensive commercial real estate database powers our information services, sources data used in our analytic services and provides content for most of our online marketplace services and our auction platform. Our ability to utilize the same commercial real estate information across our standardized platform creates efficiencies in operations and improves data quality for our customers.
We deliver our comprehensive commercial real estate information content to our U.S. and European customers primarily via an integrated suite of online service offerings that includes information about space available for-lease, comparable sales 
information, information about properties for-sale, tenant information, Internet marketing services, analytical capabilities, information for clients’ websites, information about industry professionals and their business relationships, data integration and industry news. We also operate complementary online marketplaces for commercial real estate listings and apartment rentals, as well as a commercial real estate auction platform. We strive to cross-sell our services to our customers in order to best suit their needs.
Information about our revenues, long-lived assets and total assets derived from and located in foreign countries is included in Notes 2, 3 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues; net income before interest and other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”); and total assets and liabilities for each of our segments are set forth in Notes 3 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Information about risks associated with our foreign operations is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our primary brands include CoStar®, LoopNet®, Apartments.comTM, STR®, Ten-X®, BizBuySell®, LandsofAmericaTM, and HomeSnap®, which are accessible via the Internet and through our mobile applications. Our subscription-based services consist primarily of CoStar Suite® services, which include information, analytics and online marketplace services offered to the commercial real estate industry and related professionals. CoStar Suite® is sold as a platform of service offerings consisting of CoStar Property Professional®, CoStar COMPS Professional® and CoStar Tenant®, and is our largest service offering in our North America and International operating segments.
LoopNet® is the flagship brand in our network of commercial real estate marketing sites, which also includes Cityfeet.com and Showcase.com. Our LoopNet online marketplace enables commercial property owners, landlords, and brokers to advertise properties for-sale or for-lease and to submit detailed information about property listings. Commercial real estate agents, buyers, investors, and tenants use LoopNet extensively to search for available property listings that meet their criteria. LoopNet offers unique, subscription-based advertising solutions for different segments within the industry and delivers value across its constituent networks. The LoopNet network leverages CoStar’s commercial real estate database to provide in-depth and accurate information across all commercial property types, including office, industrial, retail, restaurant, shopping center, multifamily, specialty, health care, hospitality, sports and entertainment, land, and residential income. Investors and tenants are also able to consume industry news developed by our in-house editorial team.
We are consolidating STR data and services with CoStar Suite to create an integrated platform, which is expected to allow us to create valuable new and improved tools for industry participants. We are also working on integrating the Ten-X platform into both LoopNet and CoStar, to expand the audience for Ten-X auctions to include our online commercial real estate users.
Apartments.comTM is the flagship brand in our network of apartment marketing sites, which also includes ApartmentFinder.comTM, ForRent.com®, ApartmentHomeLiving.comTM, WestsideRentals.com®, AFTER55.com®, CorporateHousing.comTM, ForRentUniversity.com®, Apartamentos.comTM, which is our apartment-listing site offered exclusively in Spanish, and OffCampusPartners.com, which provides student housing marketplace content and powers off campus housing sites for many universities across the U.S. Our apartment marketing network of subscription-based services offers renters a searchable database of apartment listings and provides property owners, professional property management companies and landlords with an advertising destination. Our apartment marketing network draws on and leverages CoStar’s multifamily database, which contains detailed information on apartment properties and is designed to meet renter preferences and demands, in order to drive traffic to those sites and attract advertisers who prefer to advertise on heavily trafficked apartment websites. Our network of apartment marketing sites provides a comprehensive selection of rentals, information on actual availabilities and rents, and in-depth data on neighborhoods, including restaurants, nightlife, history, schools and other facts important to renters. To help renters find the information that meets their needs, we have sites that also offer innovative search tools such as the PolygonTM Search tool, which allow renters to specifically define the area in which they want to find an apartment and Plan Commute tools, which allow renters to search property listings that meet their transportation needs. We also offer complementary services to the rental industry, including the ability for renters to apply for rentals online, and for landlords to receive applications, screen tenants, and process rental payments and lease renewals.
Our BizBuySell services, which include BizQuest® and FindaFranchise, provide an online marketplace for businesses and franchises for-sale. Our LandsofAmerica services, which include LandAndFarm and LandWatch®, provide an online marketplace for rural lands for-sale and are also accessible via our Land.com domain.
We also provide other services that complement those offered through our primary brands. These include real estate and lease management solutions, lease administration, lease accounting and abstraction services, through our CoStar Real Estate Manager service offerings; market research, consulting and analysis, portfolio and debt analysis, and management and reporting 
capabilities through our CoStar Investment Analysis and CoStar Risk Analytics service offerings; and benchmarking and analytics for the hospitality industry through our STR offerings.
Our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscription-based license agreements that renew automatically, a majority of which have a term of at least one year. Upon renewal, many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations. To encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based services rather than charging fees based on actual system usage or number of paid clicks. Depending on the type of service, contract rates are generally based on the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client's business focus, geography, the number and types of services to which a client subscribes, the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a client's advertised properties in the search results. Our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis. Auction transaction fees from our newly acquired online auction platform, Ten-X, are generally charged upon the successful closure of an auction as a percentage of the winning buyer's offer price for the commercial real estate property sold. We generally see higher sales of Apartments.com listing services during the peak summer rental season and higher CoStar Suite sales towards the end of the year, however sales fluctuate from year-to-year and revenue is not generally seasonal because our services are typically sold on a subscription basis.
Expansion and Growth
Acquisitions
We have expanded and continue to expand the coverage and depth of our information, analytics and online marketplace services. In addition to organic growth, we have grown our business through strategic acquisitions. Most recently, on June 24, 2020, we acquired Ten-X, which operates an online auction platform for commercial real estate; on October 26, 2020, we acquired Emporis GmbH, a Germany-based provider of international commercial real estate data and images, which we subsequently merged into another of our German subsidiaries; and on December 22, 2020, we acquired Homesnap, which operates an online mobile software platform for residential real estate agents and brokers. We continue to integrate our recent acquisitions and the services they offer into our CoStar network. See Notes 5 and 9 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these acquisitions.
Development, Investments and Expansion
We are committed to supporting, improving and enhancing our information, analytics and online marketplace solutions, including expanding and improving our offerings for property owners, property managers, brokers, agents, buyers, commercial tenants and residential renters. We expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, integrate and cross-sell services, and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research, sales and marketing organizations.
We evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers’ needs. Further, in some cases, when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs, we may decide to combine, shift focus from, de-emphasize, phase out, or eliminate a service that, among other things, overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer. In the event that we eliminate or phase out particular service offerings, we may experience reduced revenues and earnings. The decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately result in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services. However, we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings, if any, resulting from the elimination or phasing out of any service offering.
We are consolidating STR hospitality data and benchmarking and analytics services with CoStar Suite to create an integrated platform. We expect that the combination of STR's and CoStar's offerings will allow us to create valuable new and improved tools for commercial real estate industry participants. We plan to drive international expansion, in part, through STR's global operations and to apply STR's benchmarking expertise to other commercial real estate segments we serve. We are working on integrating the Ten-X platform into both the LoopNet and CoStar service offerings, to expand the audience for Ten-X auctions to include our online commercial real estate users. To increase exposure, we have upgraded LoopNet listings for properties to be auctioned on Ten-X and are allocating banner space on both our CoStar and LoopNet sites to Ten-X to cross-market our services. We are beginning to incorporate recently acquired Emporis commercial real estate data and images into CoStar, and our Homesnap team is creating new and improved tools to help agents promote their residential listings, connect with buyers and sellers and streamline their daily workflow.
We believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services, including acquisitions and expansion of our existing service offerings, have created a platform for long-term revenue growth. We expect these investments to result in further penetration of our subscription-based services and the successful cross-selling of our services to customers in existing markets.
We have invested in the expansion and development of our field sales force to support the growth and expansion of our company and our service offerings, and plan to continue to invest in, evaluate and strategically position our sales force as the Company continues to develop and grow. Specifically, we continue to invest in marketing our services, as well as in our research operations to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings to meet the growing content needs of our clients. Starting in 2019 and continuing throughout 2020, we increased our investment in Apartments.com marketing. We plan to continue to utilize a multi-channel marketing campaign and to work to determine the optimal level of marketing investment for our services for future periods. While we believe the investments we make in our business create a platform for growth, those investments may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our near-term financial position.
To support our continued expansion and development, in 2020 we completed a public equity offering, a Senior Notes offering and the refinancing of our revolving credit facility. For additional discussion of our public equity offering, Senior Notes offering and refinancing of our revolving credit facility, please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations“—Overview—Development, Investments and Expansion" and Notes 11 and 15 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry Overview
The market for real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety, volume and value of transactions related to real estate. Each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements, and in order to facilitate transactions, industry participants must have extensive, accurate and current information and analysis. Members of the real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability, properties for-sale, rental units available, rental rates, vacancy rates, tenant movements, sales comparables, supply, new construction, absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively. Market research (including historical and forecast conditions) and applied analytics are instrumental to the success of industry participants. There is a strong need for an efficient marketplace, where real estate professionals can exchange information, evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses, and interact with each other on a continuous basis.
A large number of parties involved in commercial and residential real estate and the related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses, including:

• | Sales and leasing brokers | • | Government agencies 
• | Property owners | • | Mortgage-backed security issuers
• | Property managers | • | Appraisers 
• | Design and construction professionals | • | Pension fund managers 
• | Real estate developers | • | Reporters 
• | Real estate investment trust managers | • | Tenant vendors 
• | Investment and commercial bankers | • | Building services vendors 
• | Mortgage bankers | • | Communications providers 
• | Mortgage brokers | • | Insurance companies’ managers 
• | Retailers | • | Institutional advisors 
• | Hospitality owners | • | Investors and asset managers 
• | Real estate agents | | 

The commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace. Various organizations, including hundreds of brokerage firms, directory publishers and local research companies, collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered. This highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of efforts in the collection and analysis of information, excessive internal cost and the creation of non-standardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness, resulting in a formidable information gap.
The creation and maintenance of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database, accurate and comprehensive research capabilities, experienced analysts, easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction. By combining our extensive database, researchers, our experienced team of analysts and economists, technological expertise and broad customer base, we believe that we have created such a platform.
The apartment rental advertising industry serves property managers and owners who are tasked with finding renters to occupy vacant apartments, as well as renters who are searching for their next home. Property managers have several options at their disposal, including their own websites, drive-by and outdoor advertising, traditional classified ads, free online listing services, search engine marketing and Internet listings services (“ILS”), like Apartments.com and the network of apartment listing websites we own and operate. Many apartment ILS websites feature only the rental availabilities that larger property owners pay to advertise, resulting in a poor user experience in which the renter’s search criteria return either limited or no results, irrelevant results or stale results that do not represent actual availabilities.
We believe that consumers expect accurate, actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information. Our apartment ILS websites include renter-focused features like the ability to filter search results according to various criteria (e.g., commute time to work); professional images of the properties, including immersive videos and 3-D interactive models; custom neighborhood profiles; and tenant reviews. Our network of apartment listing websites draws on our multifamily database and includes researched and verified information. We proactively gather information on available rentals to improve the accuracy of the listings on our apartment ILS websites, including real time unit-level availability, current pricing, and rent specials. We have continually invested in our network to improve the features and services offered to property managers and website users. Recent additions include: dynamic lead forms that provide more information about prospective residents, a reporting suite that provides customers with rent comparables, making rent trends information publicly available and free digital ad retargeting, and integrated online rental solutions, including lease applications, and tenant credit and background checks. We believe that we have created and maintain easily searchable apartment ILS websites with a comprehensive selection of rentals, information on actual rental availabilities and rents, and in-depth data on neighborhoods, as well as easy to use and actionable tools for the rental process.
CoStar’s Comprehensive Database
CoStar has spent more than 30 years building and acquiring databases of commercial real estate information, which includes information on leasing, sales, comparable sales, tenants, and demand statistics, as well as digital images. This highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields, tracking such categories as location, site and zoning information, building characteristics, space and unit availability, tax assessments, ownership, sales and lease comparables, space requirements, number of retail stores, number of listings, mortgage and deed information, for-sale and for-lease listings, income and expense histories, tenant names, lease expirations, contact information, historical trends, demographic information and retail sales per square foot. The database also includes building photographs, aerial photographs, 3D virtual tours, plat maps and floor plans.
CoStar Research
Research Department. Our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department. Our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through phone calls, e-mails and Internet updates, in addition to field inspections, public records review, news monitoring and third-party data feeds. We have also set up direct feeds from larger apartment sites and have put in place an automated system that compiles information sourced from the Internet in order to provide the most up-to-date information on rental availabilities.
Our researchers are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our database information, training our clients to use the CoStar products and handling their customer service questions, creating a "one touch" approach to customer care. As part of the process, researchers use to update records in our database, researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information. Because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry, many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions through our online tool, which we refer to as our Marketing Center, or directly to our researchers. 
CoStar's field research effort includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new availabilities, find additional property inventory, new construction, collect tenant information, verify existing information, photograph properties and create high quality videos of interior spaces (including walk-through videos and 3D virtual tours), amenities and exterior 
features of properties. CoStar utilizes high-tech, field research vehicles primarily within North America and Europe. A significant majority of these vehicles are customized, energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers, Global Positioning System tracking software, high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to precisely measure buildings and geo-code and position them on digital maps. Each CoStar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data. A typical site inspection consists of photographing the building, measuring the building, geo-coding the building, capturing “for-sale” or “for-lease” sign information, counting parking spaces, assessing property condition and construction, and gathering tenant information. Field researchers also canvass properties, collecting tenant data suite-by-suite. CoStar also utilizes a low-flying airplane and a fleet of drones to conduct aerial research of commercial real estate. We place researchers on the low-flying aircraft to scout additional commercial developments and take aerial photographs and videos. Our U.S. drone operators are Federal Aviation Administration certified and trained to capture aerial photographs and videos of commercial real estate. Our drone operators in the U.K. and Canada are certified and trained to Civil Aviation Authority standards with a permission for commercial operations pending.
Data and Image Providers. We license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third-party data sources. Licensing agreements with these entities allow us to use a variety of commercial real estate information, including property ownership, tenant information, demographic information, maps, aerial photographs and 3D virtual apartment tours of apartment communities, all of which enhance various CoStar services. These license agreements generally grant us a non-exclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information, analytics and online marketplaces.
Management and Quality Control Systems. Our research processes include automated and non-automated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process. A large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors, including occupancy date conflicts, available square footage greater than building area, typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases. We also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology. Our non-automated quality control procedures include:
•Calling our information sources on recently updated properties to re-verify information;
•Performing periodic research audits and field checks to determine if we correctly canvassed buildings;
•Providing training and retraining to our research professionals to ensure accurate and standardized data compilation; and
•Compiling measurable performance metrics for research teams and managers for feedback on data quality.
Finally, one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day.

Clients
We draw clients from across the real estate and related business community, including real estate brokers, agents, owners, developers, landlords, property managers, financial institutions, retailers, vendors, appraisers, investment banks, government agencies and other parties involved in real estate. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no single client accounted for more than 5% of our revenues.
Sales and Marketing
Our overall sales strategy is to provide optimal service to our existing customers, attract new clients and cross-sell the numerous solutions we have to offer. Our sales teams sell multiple products and are primarily located in field sales offices throughout the U.S., with others in Canada, the U.K., Spain, France, and Germany. Our inside sales teams are largely based in Washington, DC and Richmond, Virginia. Our inside sales professionals actively work lead lists, prospect for new customers and perform virtual product demonstrations. Our professionals utilize the Internet and remote presentation tools to convey the multiple solutions we offer. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our entire sales force has been equipped to operate remotely.
Our local offices typically support field sales and field research operations within the markets in which they operate. This enables our clients to benefit from a local presence. Our field sales force has the primary front-line responsibility for customer service, ensuring client satisfaction and building long-term relationships. Our local offices act as hubs for training, sources of market insight, product feedback sessions and connecting industry participants.
We actively manage all client accounts with frequent meetings, trainings, and updates on new enhancements. In 2020, we successfully implemented a number of important sales initiatives, focused on selling our products to brokers, property owners and lenders in the U.S. This focus will continue in 2021. Our initiatives to partner with brokers to provide value to property owners allowed us to successfully position LoopNet Ads as a valuable marketing solution for a property owner’s major risk, namely, the cost of vacant space and the resulting negative impact on valuation of the property or portfolio, a risk that has been significantly magnified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we worked closely with clients to help them navigate the unprecedented challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic through relevant training initiatives and curated webinars. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we began establishing a dedicated LoopNet sales division. Both our field sales and LoopNet sales teams will continue to sell LoopNet solutions.
To generate brand awareness and site traffic for the Apartments.com network of rental websites, we utilize a multi-channel marketing campaign featuring television and radio ads, online and digital advertising impressions, streaming audio and podcasts, social media, email, public relations and news articles, out-of-home and paid search marketing, all of which are reinforced with substantial Search Engine Optimization efforts. We plan to continue to utilize these marketing methods to generate brand awareness and site traffic for the Apartments.com network and implement similar marketing strategies for LoopNet and Ten-X. We will continue to work to determine the optimal level of marketing investment for each of these services for future periods.
Our CoStar U.K. sales force continued to grow our existing client base, and trained users on the numerous product enhancements we released during 2019 and 2020. In Canada, our sales representatives were focused on targeting brokers, owners and lender prospects for subscribing to our suite of products.
We seek to make our services essential to our clients’ businesses. To encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based information services rather than fees based on actual system usage. Contract rates for subscription-based services are generally based on the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client’s business focus, geography and the range of services subscribed for. Our marketing solutions are priced by exposure levels, the number of properties/spaces for-lease, rent or sale and the market in which they are offered. Listings for customers who purchase packages with the highest level of exposure usually appear first in search results and offer the richest media content and engagement opportunities for tenants searching for space, renters looking for an apartment or investors seeking an opportunity. Our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis.
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary marketing methods included: virtual service demonstrations; targeted paid digital marketing; retargeting and social marketing; direct marketing such as email; communication via our corporate website and news services; participation in virtual trade shows and industry events; virtual Company-sponsored events; client referrals; content marketing including webinars, seminars, and white papers and other company newsletters distributed via email to our clients and prospects.
To generate brand awareness and site traffic for the Apartments.com network of rental websites, we utilize a multi-channel marketing campaign featuring television and radio ads, online and digital advertising impressions, streaming audio and podcasts, social media, email, public relations and news articles, out-of-home and paid search marketing, all of which are reinforced with substantial Search Engine Optimization efforts. We plan to continue to utilize these marketing methods to generate brand awareness and site traffic, and will continue to work to determine the optimal level of marketing investment for our services for future periods.
Comprehensive digital marketing and direct marketing are effective means for us to find prospective clients. Our digital marketing efforts include Search Engine Optimization, paid advertising with major search engines, social media and display advertising on commercial real estate news and business websites and mobile applications, and our direct marketing efforts include television, radio, out-of-home ads, direct mail and email and, when applicable, make extensive use of our unique, proprietary database. Once we have identified a prospective client, our most effective sales method is a service demonstration. We use various forms of integrated marketing and advertising to build brand awareness, brand identity and reinforce the value and benefits of our services. We also sponsor and attend local virtual association activities and events, including industry-leading events for commercial real estate brokers, property owners, investors and retail and financial services institutions, and attend or exhibit at virtual industry trade shows and conferences to reinforce our relationships with our core user groups.
News has always been a valuable part of CoStar's core subscription offering. CoStar's award-winning news teams report on the latest deals and developments across our markets, keeping subscribers informed and driving higher usage in our core product. In 2020, we enhanced our offerings, including producing a series of special reports on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial real estate industry and working with our analyst team, added weekly video updates and periodic webinars to discuss key changes to national and local markets. We merged STR's Hotel News Now news service into CoStar News, giving CoStar subscribers direct access to STR's hospitality news and analysis, while expanding the real estate audience for STR. Similarly, following CoStar's acquisition of Ten-X, we launched news coverage of commercial real estate auctions, telling the stories of prominent properties up for bid, including those featured on Ten-X. We continued to build our newsletter franchise, adding one focused on the hospitality industry and another highlighting the best of our analyst reports. We created new features for our newsletters showcasing the best of CoStar's architectural photography and data graphics. Finally, the news team, working with CoStar's research group, now produces quarterly Power Broker stories recognizing the top deals in each of our U.S., U.K. and Canadian markets, increasing broker exposure in the marketplace.
Competition
The market for information, analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and extremely dynamic. In the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries, we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are:
•Quality and depth of the underlying databases;
•Quality and quantity of leads and leases delivered;
•Ease of use, flexibility and functionality of the software;
•Intuitiveness and appeal of the user interface;
•Timeliness of the data, including listings;
•Breadth of geographic coverage and services offered;
•Completeness and accuracy of content;
•Client service and support;
•Perception that the service offered is the industry standard;
•Price;
•Effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts;
•Proprietary nature of methodologies, databases and technical resources;
•Vendor reputation;
•Brand loyalty among customers; and
•Capital resources.
We compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies:
•Online marketing services, websites or data exchanges targeted to commercial real estate brokers, buyers and sellers of commercial real estate properties, insurance companies, mortgage brokers and lenders, such as Reed Business Information Limited and its Estates Gazette and Radius Data Exchange products, SquareFoot, officespace.com, Brevitas, Catylist (now a part of Moody's), 42Floors, Altus Group (Commercial Property Search), Digsy, Quantum Listing, RealNex MarketPlace, TenantWise, Rofo, BuildingSearch.com, CIMLS, CompStak, Rightmove, Yardi (PropertyShark and CommercialCafe), CREXi, TotalCommercial.com, DebtX, Real Capital Markets, and VTS;
•Publishers and distributors of information, analytics and marketing services, including regional providers and national print publications, such as CBRE Economic Advisors, Marshall & Swift, REIS Network (part of the Moody's Analytics Accelerator), Real Capital Analytics, Real Capital Markets, Reonomy, Yardi Matrix, RealPage and its Axiometrics business, Altus Insight and Altus RealNet (Canada);
•Search engine and Internet listing services featuring apartments for rent, such as Google, Bing, Facebook Marketplace, ApartmentGuide.com, Rent.com, Rentals.com, Zillow Rentals, Trulia Rentals, StreetEasy, NakedApartments.com, HotPads.com, MyNewPlace.com, Zumper, PadMapper, Craigslist, ApartmentList.com, Move.com, Realtor.com, Adobo, RadPad, RentJungle, RentCafe.com, RentHop, RentBerry, and ApartmentRatings;
•Hospitality benchmarking and analytics services, such as Lodging Econometrics, Kalibri Labs, Travelclick, HotStats and Shigi Group (SnapShot);
•Online and mobile software application providers in the residential real estate industry, including Zillow, Redfin and Realtor.com, as well as agent marketing platforms and workflow providers;
•Locally controlled real estate boards, exchanges or associations sponsoring property listing services and the companies with whom they partner, such as Catylist, the National Association of Realtors, CCIM Institute, Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, the Commercial Association of Realtors Data Services and AIR CRE;
•Real estate portfolio management software solutions, such as Cougar Software, MRI Software, Altus, RealPage, AppFolio and SiteCompli;
•Real estate lease management and administration software solutions, such as Accruent, Tririga, Manhattan Software, Tango Analytics, Lease Accelerator, Visual Lease, Sequnetra, Lease Harbor and AMT Direct;
•In-house research departments operated by commercial real estate brokers; and
•Public record providers.
As the market for information, analytics and online marketplaces develops, additional competitors (including companies which could have greater access to data, financial, product development, technical, analytic or marketing resources than we do) may enter the market and competition may intensify. For example, a company like Bloomberg L.P. has the resources, and has previously announced an intention, to move into the commercial real estate information business. Further, a company like Google, which has a far-reaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities, could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena. A company like Zillow, which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry, could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among Internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners. While we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors, current or future competitors could materially harm our business.
Proprietary Rights
To protect our proprietary rights in our methodologies, database, software, trademarks and other intellectual property, we depend upon a combination of:
•Trade secret, misappropriation, unfair competition, copyright, trademark, computer fraud, database protection and other laws;
•Registration of copyrights and trademarks;
•Nondisclosure, noncompetition and other contractual provisions with employees and consultants;
•License agreements with customers;
•Patent protection; and
•Technical measures.
We seek to protect our software’s source code, our database and our photography as trade secrets and under copyright law. Although copyright registration is not a prerequisite for copyright protection, we have filed for copyright registration for many of our databases, photographs, software and other materials. Under current U.S. copyright law, the arrangement and selection of data may be protected, but the actual data itself may not be. Certain U.K. database protection laws provide additional protections for our U.K. databases. We license our services under license agreements that grant our clients non-exclusive, non-transferable rights. These agreements restrict the disclosure and use of our information and prohibit the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of any of our proprietary information, methodologies or analytics.
We also attempt to protect our proprietary databases, our trade secrets and our proprietary information through confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with our employees and consultants. Our services also include technical measures designed to detect, discourage and prevent unauthorized access to and/or copying of our intellectual property. We have established an internal antipiracy team that uses fraud-detection technology to continually monitor use of our services to detect and prevent unauthorized access, and we actively prosecute individuals and firms that engage in this unlawful activity.
We maintain U.S. and international trademark registrations for CoStar’s core service names and proactively file U.S. and international trademark applications covering our new and planned service names. Our federally registered trademarks include CoStar®, CoStar Suite®, CoStar Property®, CoStar COMPS®, CoStar Tenant®, CoStar Lease Analysis®, LoopNet®, Showcase.com®, Cityfeet.com®, Apartments.com®, Lands of America®, Ten-X® and HomeSnap®, among many others. In the U.S., trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and have not been found to be generic. We consider our trademarks in the aggregate to constitute a valuable asset.
In addition, we maintain a patent portfolio that protects certain of our systems and methodologies. We currently have one granted patent in the U.K., which expires in 2021, covering, among other things, certain of our field research methodologies, five patents in Canada, which expire in 2021 (2 patents) and 2036 (3 patents), covering, among other things, certain features of our field research methodologies and user interface features, and fifteen patents in the U.S. which expire in 2021 (2 patents), 2022 (2 patents), 2025 (1 patent), 2032 (2 patents), 2036 (3 patents), 2037 (4 patents), and 2038 (1 patent), covering, among other things, certain features of our field research methodologies and user interface feature. We regard the rights protected by our patents as valuable to our business, but do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single patent or portfolio of patents as a whole.
Human Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2021, we employed 4,752 employees. U.S-based employees represent approximately 88% of the overall employee population, followed by 10% in European and Asia-Pacific and Latin American countries, and 2% in Canadian provinces. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are excellent. As is common with many German companies, employees in our German subsidiary, Thomas Daily GmbH, have elected five fellow employees to form a Works Council, which represents our employees at the location. The Works Council has certain co-determination rights and rights to receive information from us and engage us in discussions under applicable law.
Our human resources and recruiting team works in partnership with business leaders, using a robust and diverse talent attraction strategy to fill vacancies and contribute to our growth, including our Careers page on our corporate website, employee referral program, social media and digital platforms, direct outreach, partnerships with commercial real estate industry groups and universities, and specific partnerships and programs to ensure a diverse slate of candidates for each role. The development and retention of our employees is critical to our success. To support career development, we offer on-demand and in-person training programs to new hires, managers, and leaders. We also offer a mentoring program, which pairs employees seeking mentorship with more experienced colleagues.
To assess employee engagement, we partner with a survey vendor to survey employees annually. Insights and results gathered from the survey are shared with our leadership, managers and employees and help to inform our human resources program strategy each year. We believe that diverse teams deliver better and more innovative solutions. The diversity of thought that comes from different perspectives and backgrounds allows us to deliver cutting edge research and technology solutions that best serve our customers. We have a dedicated Diversity, Equity and Inclusion team that is tasked with developing topical programming, communications and training including, but not limited to, celebrations of various heritage months and oversight of our employee resource groups, which create avenues for mentoring and professional development within these groups as well as education and awareness across the organization.
We provide competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain high quality talent. In addition to base salaries, compensation may include annual bonuses, commissions, and equity awards. Employees may also participate in an Employee Stock Purchase 
Plan, and a 401(k) Plan with a company match. Our comprehensive set of health and wellness benefits are affordable, high quality and valuable to employees and their families. Employees have multiple choices for health plans, access to vision and dental benefits and may participate in our employee wellness program as well as our employee assistance program. Additional benefits include paid time off, parental bonding leave, college savings benefits, tuition reimbursement, company-subsidized commuter benefits and access to mental health, tax, and legal services.
We consider the health and wellbeing of our employees, clients, and communities to be our top priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. We transitioned from in-office to remote work for non-essential employees in early March of 2020 through the adoption of new, stable, and secure technologies to support employees in remaining fully productive while working remotely. We also adopted new policies and procedures to ensure safety, which currently include requirements for mask wearing in the office and when coming into contact with the community. We provide personal protective equipment for all employees, including face coverings, hand sanitizer, antibacterial surface sanitizer and other protective equipment as needed. In addition, our office space workstations have been redesigned and upgraded to allow for six feet of social distancing between them and include physical barrier shielding. HVAC systems in our offices have been upgraded with enhanced filtration, increased fresh air intake and ultraviolet lighting disinfection. We have also made a significant investment in commercial grade air filtration equipment and monitor air quality in majority of our office locations. Finally, all high contact surfaces in our offices are cleaned multiple times during the day and deep cleaned each night. We also provide free COVID-19 PCR and antibody testing for our employees and their immediate household family members.
