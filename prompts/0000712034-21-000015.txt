ITEM 1. BUSINESS
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the terms "ACCO Brands," "ACCO," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ACCO Brands Corporation, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2005, and its consolidated domestic and international subsidiaries. 
For a description of certain factors that may have had, or may in the future have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
Overview of the Company
ACCO Brands designs, markets, and manufactures well-recognized consumer, school, technology and office products. Our widely known brands include AT-A-GLANCE®, Barrilito®, Derwent®, Esselte®, Five Star®, Foroni®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Leitz®, Marbig®, Mead®, NOBO®, PowerA®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Rexel®, Swingline®, Tilibra®, TruSens® and Wilson Jones®. Approximately 75 percent of our sales come from brands that occupy the No. 1 or No. 2 position in the product categories in which we compete. Our top 12 brands represented $1.3 billion of our 2020 net sales. We distribute our products through a wide variety of retail and commercial channels to ensure that our products are readily and conveniently available for purchase by consumers and other end-users, wherever they prefer to shop. These channels include mass retailers, e-tailers, discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; hardware and specialty stores; independent office product dealers; office superstores; wholesalers; contract stationers, technology specialty businesses, and our direct-to-consumer channel. Our products are sold primarily in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Australia, Canada, and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 44 percent of our net sales were in the U.S.
ACCO Brands is in the midst of a substantive transformation of its business. Today we are a global enterprise focused on developing innovative branded consumer and technology products for use in businesses, schools, and homes. Sales in the commercial channels have been declining for several years, and customers within the channel have been consolidating. Therefore, we have refocused our business to sell more in the mass merchant, e-commerce and technology channels to increase growth and profitability and to reduce reliance on declining customers and commoditized product categories. The commercial channel was also significantly impacted by COVID-19 in 2020. As a result of both of these factors, our top five customers represented 34 percent of our sales in 2020, compared with 43 percent in 2016.
We have been strategically transforming our business to be more consumer- and brand-centric, product differentiated, and geographically diverse. We are successfully achieving this transformation through both organic initiatives and acquisitions. Organically, we have grown our Kensington® computer accessories offerings and entered the wellness category with TruSens® branded air purifiers, which we plan to expand over the next few years. ACCO remains a leading supplier of school products, including our top-selling Five Star® line of school notebooks, laminating machines, and stapling and punching products, among others. We have refreshed most of our line of shredders in EMEA over the past three years, improving consumer designs. This refresh includes a new line of personal shredders to capitalize on the work-from-home environment. Shredder sales have remained strong, and we plan to leverage our platforms globally. During 2020, EMEA also launched organization and storage products for home offices under the Leitz® WOW and Leitz® Cosy brands.
Our approach to acquisitions has been focused on consolidation, geographic expansion, and adjacency opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Strategically, we are focusing on categories or geographies that provide opportunities for growth, leading brands, and channel diversity. We have made five acquisitions over the past five years. These acquisitions have meaningfully expanded our portfolio of well-known brands, enhanced our competitive position from both a product and channel perspective, and added scale to our operations. As a result, our foreign businesses contributed over half of our sales in 2020, up from 43 percent in 2016.
Our most recent acquisition of PowerA in late 2020 is about accelerating growth and entering into an attractive consumer product adjacency of third-party video game controllers, power charging stations, and headsets. The addition of PowerA will meaningfully improve our organic sales growth and profitability and increase our presence in faster growing mass and e-commerce channels. PowerA is expected to provide strong double-digit sales growth in the U.S., as well as opportunities for expansion internationally, particularly in Europe. It greatly advances our strategic shift toward consumer, school and technology products as more than half of our sales will now come from these product categories, which offer faster growing demand. On a pro forma basis, including full year PowerA sales for 2020, computer and gaming products would represent approximately 22 percent of our sales.

Our leading product category positions provide the scale to invest in marketing and product innovation to drive profitable growth. We now expect to grow in mature markets in consumer, technology, and adjacent categories driven by new product development. We will also continue to grow in emerging markets once the impact of COVID-19 subsides in Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. In all of our markets, we see opportunities for sales growth through share gains, channel and geographic expansion, and product enhancements.
We generate strong operating cash flow, and will continue to leverage our cost structure through acquisitions, synergies and productivity savings to drive long-term profit and operating cash flow improvement.

Operating Segments
ACCO Brands has three operating business segments based in different geographic regions. Each business segment designs, markets, sources, manufactures, and sells recognized consumer, technology and other end-user demanded branded products used in businesses, schools, and homes. Product designs are tailored to end-user preferences in each geographic region, and where possible, leverage common engineering, design, and sourcing.
Our product categories include computer and gaming accessories; storage and organization; notebooks; laminating, shredding, and binding machines; calendars; stapling; punching; dry erase boards; and do-it-yourself tools, among others. Our portfolio includes both globally and regionally recognized brands. 

Operating Segment | Geography | Primary Brands | Primary Products 
ACCO Brands North America | United States and Canada | Five Star®, Quartet®, AT-A-GLANCE®, GBC®, Swingline®, Kensington®, Mead®, Hilroy® and PowerA® | Computer and gaming accessories, school products, planners, storage and organization (3-ring binders), dry erase boards, laminating, binding, stapling and punching products. 
ACCO Brands EMEA | Europe, Middle East and Africa | Leitz®, Rapid®, Esselte®, Kensington®, Rexel® GBC®, NOBO®, Derwent® and PowerA® | Storage and organization products (lever-arch binders, sheet protectors, indexes), computer and gaming accessories, stapling, punching, laminating, shredding, do-it-yourself tools, dry erase boards and writing instruments
ACCO Brands International | Australia/N.Z., Latin America and Asia-Pacific | Tilibra®, GBC®, Barrilito®, Foroni®, Marbig®, Kensington®, Artline®*, Wilson Jones®, PowerA®, Quartet®, Spirax® and Rexel®*Australia/N.Z. only | School notebooks, storage and organization products (binders, sheet protectors and indexes), laminating, shredding, writing and arts products, janitorial supplies, dry erase boards and stapling and punching products

ACCO Brands EMEA | 32 | | | 29 | | 31 |

 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Seasonality
Although we did not experience normal seasonality in 2020 because of disruption from the pandemic, typically each of our segments has demand that varies based on certain seasonal drivers. For North America, the important seasonal selling periods are related to back-to-school and calendar year end. The North America back-to-school season mainly occurs in the second and third quarters with the third quarter also seeing stronger technology product sales. The calendar year end drives significant sales of gaming, technology and dated products. The EMEA segment experiences much less seasonality than the other segments, but the first and fourth quarters are typically stronger, with the second and third impacted by lower demand due to summer vacations. The International segment has strong back-to-school sales in the fourth quarter and into January as Brazil and Australia are in the Southern hemisphere. However, the segment also includes a smaller business in Mexico where back-to-school straddles the second and third quarters.
Our recent acquisition of PowerA and previous acquisitions in Mexico and Brazil have increased the size of our seasonal businesses. As a result of the seasonal nature of the demand for our products, we have generated, and we expect to continue to generate, a significant percentage of our sales and profit during the second, third, and fourth quarters. However, our cash flow seasonality is almost all in the second half of the year, as the cash inflow in the first quarter is consumed in the second quarter as inventory. Our third and fourth quarter cash flow comes from completing the working capital cycle and collecting our accounts receivable. 
For further information on the seasonality of net sales, earnings and cash flow, see "Note 20. Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report and "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources."
Customers
We distribute our products through a wide variety of retail and commercial channels to ensure that our products are readily and conveniently available for purchase by consumers and other end-users, wherever they prefer to shop. These channels include mass retailers, e-tailers, discount, drug/grocery and variety chains, warehouse clubs, hardware and specialty stores, independent office product dealers, office superstores, wholesalers, contract stationers, and specialist technology businesses. We also sell directly to commercial and consumer end-users through e-commerce sites and our direct sales organization. Changes in consumer buying patterns have resulted in greater purchases of our products through mass retailers and e-tailers, mitigating the impact of lower sales experienced by the traditional office products suppliers and wholesale channels. This change was accelerated in 2020 due to the pandemic. PowerA's sales have approximately 75 percent overlap with our current customers, including major mass merchants and e-commerce companies.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top ten customers accounted for 44 percent of net sales. Staples/Essendant accounted for approximately 9 percent and 10 percent of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Amazon, Walmart, and Target each exceeded 5 percent of our sales in 2020.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by large, sophisticated customers; low barriers to entry; and competition from a wide range of products and services. ACCO Brands competes with numerous branded consumer products manufacturers, as well as many private label suppliers and importers, including various customers who import their own private label products directly from foreign sources. Examples of branded competitors include Bi-Silque, Blue Sky, CCL Industries, Corsair, Dominion Blueline, Fellowes, Hamelin, Herlitz, Logitech, LSC Communications, Newell Brands, Novus, PDP, Razer, Smead, Spiral Binding, Stanley Black and Decker, Steel Series, and Targus, among others.
The Company meets competitive challenges by creating and maintaining leading brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value, performance, and benefits to consumers. Our products are sold to consumers and end-users through diverse distribution channels that require superior customer service. We further meet consumer needs by developing, producing, and procuring products at a competitive cost, enabling them to be sold at attractive selling prices. We also believe that our experience with successfully managing a complex assortment and large seasonal demands is a competitive advantage. Our strong relationships with technology providers is also a competitive advantage for our computer and video gaming accessories businesses.
Product Development
Our strong commitment to understanding consumers and designing products that fulfill their needs drives our product development strategy, which we believe is, and will continue to be, a key contributor to our success. Our products are developed by our internal research and development team or through partnership initiatives with inventors, vendors and technology providers. Costs related to product development when paid directly by ACCO Brands are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
We seek opportunities to invest in new products and adjacencies. Our innovation efforts focus on generating new, exciting and differentiated products that support our strategic shift toward a faster growing, more consumer-oriented business. The criteria we use in assessing strategic fit or investment opportunities include: the ability to create strong, differentiated products and brands; the importance of the product category to key customers and consumers; the relationship with existing product lines; the importance to the market; and the actual and potential impact on our sales and operating performance.
Marketing and Demand Generation
We support our brands with a significant investment in targeted marketing, catalogs, digital and social media, advertising, and consumer promotions that increase brand awareness, drive conversion, and highlight the innovation and differentiation of our products. We work with third-party vendors, such as Nielsen, NPD Group, GfK SE, and Kantar Group, to capture and analyze consumer buying habits and product trends. We also use our deep consumer knowledge to develop effective marketing programs, strategies, and merchandising activities.
Supply
Our products are either manufactured or sourced to ensure that we supply our customers with quality products, innovative solutions, attractive pricing, and convenient customer service. We have built a customer-focused business model with a flexible supply chain to ensure that these factors are appropriately balanced. Using a combination of our own manufacturing and third-party sourcing enables us to reduce costs and effectively manage our production assets by lowering capital investment and working capital requirements. Our overall strategy is to manufacture locally those products that would incur a relatively high freight and/or duty expense or that have high customer service needs. We use third parties to source those products that require higher direct labor to produce. We also look for opportunities to leverage our manufacturing facilities to improve operating efficiencies, as well as customer service. We currently manufacture approximately 40 percent of our products where we operate and source the remaining 60 percent from lower cost countries, primarily China, but increasingly from Vietnam and other Far Eastern countries and Eastern Europe.
Intellectual Property
Our products are marketed under a variety of trademarks. Some of our more significant trademarks include ACCO®, AT-A-GLANCE®, Barrilito®, Derwent®, Esselte®, Five Star®, Foroni®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Leitz®, Marbig®, Mead®, NOBO®, PowerA®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Rexel®, Swingline®, Tilibra®, and Wilson Jones®. We own rights to these trademarks in various countries throughout the world. We protect these marks as appropriate through registrations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We also own numerous patents worldwide. Additionally, our PowerA business depends on maintaining our licensing rights with key game console manufacturers and video game publishers.
Human Capital Resources
As the Home of Great Brands Built by Great People, we believe our employees are the key ingredient to our success. In alignment with our Vision, Values and Leadership Promise, we strive to create a great place to work… one that attracts top talent and motivates them to stay and contribute to our winning team. The Company’s strategic plan for Human Resources is focused on fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, developing leadership and talent, and enabling and engaging employees.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 6,100 full-time and part-time employees worldwide, with approximately 4,200 employees based outside of the U.S. Approximately 660 employees in our North American business are covered by collective bargaining agreements in certain of our manufacturing and distribution facilities. One of these agreements covering approximately 320 employees, expired in 2020 and is in the process of being re-negotiated. Outside the U.S., we have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements in certain countries, particularly in Europe. There have been no strikes or material labor disputes at any of our facilities during the past five years.
Diversity and Inclusion
At ACCO Brands, our values include respecting the individual and celebrating diversity. We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in improved and more innovative products and services, and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. One of ACCO Brands’ goals is to increase the percentage of director-level-and-above female leaders to 33% (40% in North America) by 2025.
Talent Management and Succession Planning
Building and sustaining strong talent is critical to our success. We know that offering the right mix of on-the-job experiences and learning and development will support our goal of building capable and ready talent to lead the Company. Additionally, we invest in our employees by building individual and organizational capabilities that provide relevant learning and development solutions closely linked to business strategies. We deliver Company-required learning to ensure compliance with our Code of Conduct and other important policies. We enhance leadership effectiveness by fostering managers who recognize that people leadership is where they impact the business and their teams. Our “Raising the Bar” leadership development program supports the Company’s mission to have effective leaders at all levels.
Employee Engagement
An important factor in our ability to deliver sustainable, long-term value and optimize resource utilization is our proactive management of employee engagement and change. We periodically invite employees to give candid feedback about their experiences working for ACCO Brands through an Employee Engagement Survey. Our employees enthusiastically respond at world-class participation rates. We also encourage employees to volunteer their time, efforts, and ideas to create a work culture that reflects their ideals and values. This active engagement of leadership and employees not only drives our workplace culture, it also results in positive business performance.
Employee Health and Safety ("EHS")
We are committed to Mission Zero— pursuing continuous improvement in health and safety within all our locations and to attain our goal of zero accidents and zero incidents. We have implemented our Comprehensive Environmental and Safety Management Plan ("CESMP") as an overall management system for our manufacturing and distribution locations. CESMP audits are completed by our EHS teams to measure the proactive steps each location is taking to prevent injuries. 
Community Involvement
We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work. Our corporate values include acting responsibly in our global communities through numerous employee volunteer and outreach initiatives. We encourage our employees to make a difference in our Company and in their communities by building on a fundamental commitment to integrity, teamwork, respect and inclusivity. We support a wide range of charities, the most significant of which is City of Hope in the U.S, which has been ongoing for many years.
