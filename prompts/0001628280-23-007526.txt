ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview and Recent Developments
The Company is a U.S.-based, fully integrated shipowner-operator, providing global transportation solutions to a diverse group of customers including miners, producers, traders and end users. Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, with offices in Singapore and Copenhagen, Eagle focuses exclusively on the versatile midsize drybulk vessel segment and owns one of the largest fleets of Supramax/Ultramax vessels in the world. The Company performs all management services in-house (strategic, commercial, operational, technical, and administrative) and employs an active management approach to fleet trading with the objective of optimizing revenue performance and maximizing earnings on a risk-managed basis. 
As of December 31, 2022, our owned fleet totaled 53 vessels, or 3.20 million deadweight ton (“dwt”), with an average age of 9.6 years. 

Vessel acquisitions and sales
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company executed agreements to acquire two modern, efficient vessels and to sell the oldest vessel in its fleet:
•During the second quarter of 2022, the Company signed a memorandum of agreement to sell the vessel Cardinal (a 2004-built Supramax) for total consideration of $15.8 million. The vessel was delivered to the buyer during the third quarter of 2022. The Company recorded a gain of $9.3 million upon sale of the vessel in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.
•During the third quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a memorandum of agreement to acquire a high-specification 2015-built scrubber-fitted Ultramax bulkcarrier for total consideration of $27.5 million. The vessel was delivered to the Company during the fourth quarter of 2022.
•During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a memorandum of agreement to acquire a high-specification 2015-built Ultramax bulkcarrier for total consideration of $24.3 million. The Company paid a deposit of $3.6 million on this vessel as of December 31, 2022. The vessel was delivered to the Company during the first quarter of 2023.
Mission + Vision + Values
MISSION
Providing optimized global transportation of drybulk commodities; delivering superior results for our customers and stakeholders.
VISION
To be the leading integrated shipowner-operator through consistent outperformance and sustainable growth.
VALUES
•PASSION for excellence drives us
•EMPOWERMENT of our people leads to better results
•INTEGRITY defines our culture
•RESPONSIBILITY to safety underpins every decision
•FORWARD THINKING takes us to a more successful tomorrow 
Business Strategy
•Focus on the most versatile drybulk vessel segment 
We focus on owning and operating vessels within the midsize Supramax/Ultramax segment. We consider this vessel segment to be the most versatile amongst the various drybulk asset classes due to the optimal size and specifications of Supramax/Ultramax ships, which allows us to carry the most diversified cargo mix when compared to other sizes of drybulk carriers. With a size ranging from 50,000 to 65,000 dwt and a length of approximately 200 meters, Supramax/Ultramax vessels are able to accommodate large cargo quantities and call on the majority of ports around the globe. In addition, these vessels are equipped with onboard cranes and grabs, giving them the ability to load and discharge cargoes without the need for shore-based port equipment/infrastructure. We believe the versatility and flexibility of Supramax/Ultramax vessels provide for improved risk-adjusted returns throughout the cycles. 
•Employ an active management strategy for fleet trading
We employ an active management strategy for fleet employment with the objective of optimizing revenue performance and maximizing earnings on a risk-managed basis. Through the execution of various commercial strategies employed across our global trading desks in the United States, Europe and Asia, the Company has been able to achieve optimal TCE (as defined herein) results and outperform the relevant market index on a consistent basis. 
•Execute on fleet renewal and growth
Since 2016, and through the date of this Annual Report, we have executed on a comprehensive fleet renewal program totaling 55 vessel transactions. We have acquired 33 modern vessels and sold 22 of our oldest and least-efficient vessels. We believe these transactions have vastly improved our fleet makeup, enabling us to generate incremental revenue on a per ship basis; we have been able to maintain our fleet age profile at an optimized level, increase our cargo-carrying capacity per ship and improve our fleet emissions profile (as measured by fuel consumption per dwt).
•Perform technical management in-house 
We perform all technical management services relating to vessel maintenance, vessel repairs and crewing.
•Implement a prudent approach to balance sheet management
We believe the long-term success of our Company is contingent on maintaining a prudent approach to balance sheet management, including working capital optimization, diversifying capital sources, lowering cost of capital, limiting interest rate exposure and optimizing the debt profile. 
•Emphasize Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors
We published our first comprehensive ESG Sustainability Report in 2020. The document was prepared in accordance with the Marine Transportation Framework, established by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. Our reports are available for download on our company website. Initiatives we have undertaken include: 
Environmental
•Executing on a comprehensive fleet renewal program, acquiring modern efficient vessels and selling older, less efficient ones, which has resulted in an improved fleet makeup and reduced greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions on a ton-mile basis.
•Creating a performance department and implementing performance optimization software, which has resulted in improved vessel performance and reduced fuel consumption.
•Applying high-specification hull coatings and installing various energy saving devices to improve vessel performance and reduce fuel consumption.
•Reducing sulfur emissions by approximately 85% by following strategies to comply with the International Maritime Organization’s (“IMO”) fuel sulfur content regulations, which went into effect in January 2020.
•Investigating existing and emerging technologies to reduce GHG emissions including completing our first 100% sustainable biofuel voyage on the M/V Sydney Eagle in 2021 and a subsequent 100% sustainable biofuel voyage on the M/V Stamford Eagle in 2022.
•Embedding a Sustainability-linked feature to our Global Ultraco Debt Facility (as defined herein), which allows the Company to benefit from improved margin pricing on its borrowings, subject to meeting certain performance indicators relating to Fleet Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) Performance and Green Spending.
•Joining the Getting to Zero Coalition, a global alliance of more than 200 companies committed to the decarbonization of deep-sea shipping in line with the IMO GHG emissions reduction strategy and, ultimately, the alignment of shipping emissions with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement.
•Becoming a signatory to the Sea Cargo Charter, a global framework for aligning chartering activities with responsible environmental behavior in order to promote international shipping’s decarbonization. The Sea Cargo Charter is consistent with the IMO’s ambition for GHG emissions from international shipping to peak as soon as possible and to reduce by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.
•Joining the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping as Mission Ambassador, which is a not-for-profit, independent research and development center. It works across the shipping sector with industry, academia and authorities to create an overview of viable decarbonization pathways, facilitate the development and implementation of new energy technologies, build confidence in new concepts and their supply chains and accelerate the energy transition by defining and maturing viable strategic pathways.
•Joining other industry leaders in calling on policy makers to prioritize the implementation of a carbon pricing mechanism and dedicated shipping industry decarbonized research and development fund during COP26 held in Glasgow, Scotland.
Social
•Abiding by equal opportunity employer guidelines and promoting diversity in the workforce.
•Recognizing and complying with the Maritime Labor Convention, which was adopted by the International Labor Organization (“ILO”). All of our crew labor contracts are International Transport Workers’ Federation compliant agreements.
•Becoming a signatory to The Neptune Declaration, a global “call to action” initiative to help end the unprecedented crew change crisis affecting the maritime industry as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and its impact to worldwide travel.
•Implementing a robust safety management system.
•Volunteering with, and donating to, various local charities and causes.
•Providing paid internship opportunities to university students.
Governance
•Setting up a best-in-class corporate governance structure.
•Combating corruption through strict internal procedures and training, as well as taking part in collective action through our membership in the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network.
•Adopting a comprehensive code of ethics program within the organization that provides ongoing training and robust controls.
•Focusing on highly transparent reporting of sustainability, operating, and financial performance.

Commercial Strategies
The following is a brief description of the commercial strategies we use to employ our vessels:
1)Time Charter-Out
Time charter-out describes a contract for the use of a ship for an agreed period of time, at an agreed hire rate per day. Commercial control of the vessel becomes the responsibility of the time charterer who performs the voyage(s). The time charterer is responsible to pay the agreed hire and also purchase the fuel and pay port expenses. Time charters can range from as short as one voyage (approximately 20-40 days) to multiple years.
2)Voyage Chartering
Voyage chartering involves the employment of a vessel between designated ports for the duration of the voyage only. Freight is earned on the volume of cargo carried. In contrast to the Time charter-out method, in a voyage charter, we maintain control of the commercial operation and are responsible for managing the voyage, including vessel scheduling and routing, as well as any related costs, such as fuel, port expenses and other expenses. Having the ability to control and manage the voyage, we are able to generate increased margin through operational efficiencies, business intelligence and scale. Additionally, contracting to carry cargoes on voyage terms often gives us the ability to utilize a wide range of vessels to perform the contract 
(as long as the vessel meets the contractual parameters), thereby giving significant operational flexibility to the fleet. Such vessels include not only ships we own, but also third-party ships, which can be chartered-in on an opportunistic basis (the inverse of a Time charter-out strategy).
3)Vessel + Cargo Arbitrage
With this strategy, we contract to carry a cargo on voyage terms (as described above under the caption “Voyage Chartering”) with a specific ship earmarked to cover the commitment. As the date of cargo loading approaches, the market may have moved in such a way whereby we elect to substitute a different vessel to perform the voyage, while assigning a different piece of business to the original earmarked ship. Taken as a whole, this strategy can generate increased revenues, on a risk-managed basis, as compared to the original cargo-vessel pairing.
4)Time Charter-In
This strategy involves us leasing a vessel from a third-party shipowner at a set U.S. dollar per day rate. As referenced above, vessels can be time-chartered in order to cover existing cargo commitments, resulting in a Vessel + Cargo arbitrage. These ships may be chartered-in for periods longer than required for the initial cargo or arbitrage, and can also be chartered-in opportunistically in order to benefit from rate dislocations and to obtain risk-managed exposure to the market overall.
5)Hedging (FFAs)
Forward Freight Agreements (“FFAs”) are cleared financial instruments, which we can use to hedge market freight rate exposure by locking in a fixed rate against the eventual forward market. FFAs are an important tool to manage market risk associated with chartering-in of third-party vessels. FFAs can also be used to lock in revenue streams on owned vessels or against forward cargo commitments the Company may enter into.
6)Asymmetric Optionality
This is a blended strategy approach whereby we utilize time charters, cargo commitments and FFAs together to hedge away market exposure while maintaining upside optionality to positive market volatility. As a simplified example, a ship may be time chartered-in for one year with a further optional year. In such a scenario, and dependent on market conditions, we could sell an FFA for the firm 1-year period commitment, essentially eliminating exposure to the market, while maintaining full upside on rate developments for the optional year.  
Additional information regarding the types of charters that we may enter into is as follows: 
    
 | Types of Charters 
Charter Characteristics | VoyageCharter | TimeCharter | IndexCharter 
Typical contract length | Single voyage | One or multiple voyages | Six months or more 
Hire rate basis (1) | Per metric ton of cargo loaded | Daily | Linked to BSI 
Voyage expenses (2) | We pay | Customer pays | Customer pays 
Vessel operating expenses for owned vessels (3) | We pay | We pay | We pay 
Charter hire expense for vessels chartered-in | We pay | We pay | We pay 
Off-hire (4) | Customer does not pay | Customer does not pay | Customer does not pay


(1)‘Hire rate’ refers to a sum of money paid to the vessel owner by a charterer under a time charter party for the use of a vessel. ‘Freight rate basis’ means the sum of money paid to the vessel owner 
under a voyage charter or contract of affreightment based on the unit measurement of cargo loaded. ‘BSI’ refers to the “Baltic Supramax Index” and the daily hire rate varies based on the Index. Please refer to the Glossary for further detail on how the BSI is calculated. 
(2)Voyage expenses include fuel, port charges, canal tolls and brokerage commissions.
(3)Vessel operating expenses include crewing, repairs and maintenance, insurance, stores, lubes and communication expenses.
(4)‘Off-hire’ refers to the time a vessel is unavailable to perform the service either due to scheduled or unscheduled repairs.
The Company employs its fleet opportunistically in an effort to maximize earnings. The Company enters into charters and is continuously developing contractual relationships directly with cargo interests. These relationships and the related cargo contracts have the dual benefit of providing greater operational efficiencies and act as a balance to the Company’s naturally long position to the market. Notwithstanding the focus on short-term chartering, the Company consistently monitors the drybulk shipping market and, based on market conditions, will consider entering into long-term time charters if and when appropriate.
The following summary represents the status of employment of our owned fleet as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:

 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2020
Time Charter | 55% | 53% | 40% 
Voyage Charter | 43% | 42% | 56% 
Shipyard (1) | 2% | 6% | 4% 


(1)Vessels in shipyard were undergoing statutory drydock, BWTS installation or other necessary repairs.
In connection with the charters of each of our vessels, unaffiliated third-party ship brokers earn commissions, with the total amount ranging from 1.25% to 5.00% of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter, with the commission rate depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the relevant charter.
Our Customers

Our customers include some of the world’s leading agricultural, mining, manufacturing and trading companies, as well as smaller, privately owned companies. Our assessment of customers’ financial condition and reliability is an important factor in negotiating employment for our vessels. We evaluate the counterparty risk of potential customers based on our management’s experience in the shipping industry combined with the additional input of an independent credit risk consultant. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. 
Operations

We carry out the commercial, technical and strategic management of our fleet through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Eagle Bulk Management LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company which maintains its principal executive offices in Stamford, Connecticut. We also maintain offices in Copenhagen (Denmark) and Singapore. 
The two central aspects to the operation of our fleet include:

•Commercial operations, which involve chartering and operating a vessel; and
•Technical operations, which involve maintaining, crewing and repairing a vessel.
Each of the Company’s vessels serve the same type of customer, have similar operation and maintenance requirements, operate in the same regulatory environment, and are subject to similar economic characteristics. Based on this, the Company has determined that it operates in one reportable segment which is engaged in the ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership and operation of drybulk vessels. 
Commercial Management
We perform the commercial management of our fleet, including obtaining employment for our vessels and maintaining relationships with the charterers of our vessels. We have three offices across the globe located in the U.S., Europe and Asia, which allows for 24-hour market coverage. We believe that due to our management team’s experience in operating drybulk vessels, we have access to a broad range of charterers and can employ our fleet efficiently in diverse market conditions allowing us to achieve high utilization rates. 

Being an active owner-operator means effectively seeking to operate our own vessels when possible, as compared with time chartering them to other operators, all with a view toward achieving higher-than-market net charter hire income. In doing so, we believe we can take advantage of rapidly changing market conditions and obtain better operational efficiencies from our fleet. 
Technical Management

We have established in-house technical management capabilities, through which we provide technical management services to all vessels in our fleet. Technical management includes managing day-to-day operation of the vessel and machinery; performing general maintenance; ensuring regulatory and classification society compliance; supervising the general efficiency of the vessel; arranging the hire of qualified officers and crew; planning, arranging and supervising drydocking and repairs; purchasing supplies, spare parts, lubes and new equipment; and appointing supervisors and technical consultants.
General and Administrative Management
Our business operations include administrative support from Strategic (vessel acquisition and sale), Legal (compliance and insurance), Finance (accounting and treasury), Information Technology and Administrative (executive and human resources) personnel. 
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we have an aggregate of 96 shore-based personnel employed in our three office locations. We value a diverse workforce and our shore-based personnel are comprised of 27 different nationalities. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer in our hiring and promoting practices, benefits and wages. 
We take a systemic approach to hiring, training and developing our employees based on our code of ethics. This includes creating individual goals based on company priorities and providing employees periodic feedback in order to assess individual performance. We have developed internal promoting practices based on objective annual performance evaluations, encouraging employees to develop within their chosen career path and providing necessary professional trainings as needed. We also employ a succession planning process that identifies suitable candidates, and their development needs, for key positions in the company. 
Seafarers
In addition to our shore-based personnel, we employ approximately 1,000 officers and crew members on our owned fleet. We hire our crew through third-party manning agencies and currently source seafarers from a number of countries, including Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, Georgia, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, India and Egypt. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and current and future sanctions imposed as a result of it, may adversely affect our ability to hire and/or pay for our crew. In response to this risk, the Company recruited one new third-party manning agency during 2022 and another during 2023 in order to diversify our crew nationality exposure and 
increase our sourcing from the Philippines. 
The third-party crew managers are responsible for the recruitment of crew members with training, licenses and experience appropriate for our vessels. On board, our crews perform most operational and maintenance work and assist in supervising work during cargo operations and at drydock facilities. We often man our vessels with more crew members than are required by the vessel’s Flag State safe manning requirement in order to allow for the performance of routine maintenance duties. All of our crew members are subject to and are paid commensurate with international collective bargaining agreements and, therefore, we do not anticipate any labor disruptions. The international collective bargaining agreements, to which we are a party, are typically renewed for a two-year term. 
Human rights, health and safety
For our crew members on our ships, we maintain security measures to ensure well-being and safety on our ships. We developed and implemented a safety management system in compliance with the International Safety Management Code and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. All necessary certificates required by the IMO were obtained by our in-house technical managers. We comply with the Maritime Labor Convention adopted by the ILO in 2006 (the “MLC 2006”). The MLC 2006 outlines the minimum requirements for seafarers to work, conditions of employment, facilities while on board and health and welfare protection. The MLC 2006 obliges all ships above 500 gross tons in international trade to have a Maritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labor Compliance. All our vessels and crew are compliant with the MLC 2006 and we intend to maintain them accordingly. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, government-imposed travel restrictions, which were put in place in order to curtail the spread of the virus, created substantial challenges with respect to being able to effect crew changes and repatriation, and our seafarers sometimes had to work past their contractual employment periods. It has been a strategic priority of ours to relieve our seafarers as close to their contractual due dates as possible and we have successfully managed crew changeovers even in light of evolving travel restrictions in many countries. In order to achieve this result, we had to divert some of our ships and/or incur additional off-hire costs in addition to higher crew change expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately 63 days of additional off-hire related to crew changes. These costs notwithstanding, we believe it is our obligation to our seafarers to ensure their overall health and safety. 

Permits, Authorizations and Regulations

We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our vessels. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required depend upon several factors, including the commodity transported, the waters in which the vessel operates, the nationality of the vessel’s crew and the age of a vessel. We expect to be able to obtain all permits, licenses and certificates currently required to permit our vessels to operate. Additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which increase the cost of us doing business.

Our vessels operate worldwide in compliance with trading limits imposed by governmental economic sanctions regimes and insurance terms and do not operate in or conduct business with countries or territories that are subject to United States, European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom or United Nations (“UN”) comprehensive country-wide or territory-wide sanctions.
Environmental and Other Regulations

Government regulation impacts the operation of our vessels. We are subject to international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may transit or operate relating to safety and health and environmental protection including the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, the remediation of contamination and 
liability for damage to natural resources. Compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements entails significant expense, including required vessel modifications and implementation of certain operating procedures. 

A variety of government and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port authorities (including national Coast Guards, harbor masters and port state control authorities), classification societies, flag state administrations (country of vessel registry), as well as our charterers and terminal operators. Certain of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses and certificates for the operation of our vessels. Failure to maintain the necessary permits or approvals could result in substantial costs in fines and penalties or result in the temporary suspension of the operation of one or more of our vessels.

We believe that the heightening levels of environmental and quality concerns among regulators, charterers and the insurance industry is leading to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels, which may accelerate the recycling of older vessels throughout the shipping industry. Increasingly stringent environmental regulations have created a demand for vessels that conform to the most up-to-date environmental standards, whether through retrofitting or new design. We strive to maintain operating standards for all of our vessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews and adherence to applicable international regulations. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because such laws and regulations are subject to change and may impose stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. 

International Maritime Organization (IMO)

The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations body for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by ships, has adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 (“MARPOL”). MARPOL has been in effect since October 2, 1983 and has been adopted by over 150 nations, including many of the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate. MARPOL sets forth pollution-prevention requirements applicable to different types of vessels and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried in bulk, in liquid or packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively; and Annex VI relates to air emissions. Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997.
In 2013, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”) was adopted by resolution amendments to MARPOL Annex I Conditional Assessment Scheme (“CAS”). The amendments, which became effective on October 1, 2014, pertain to the inspections of bulkcarriers and tankers and require compliance with the 2011 Enhanced Survey Programme Code, which enhances the programs of inspections. We made the necessary financial expenditures to comply with these amendments.
Air Emissions

Annex VI to MARPOL, which was designed to address air pollution from vessels and which became effective on May 19, 2005, sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ships and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also regulates shipboard incineration and the emission of volatile organic compounds from tankers. In addition, Annex VI includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls of sulfur emissions known as Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”), as explained below.

MEPC adopted amendments to Annex VI on October 10, 2008, which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. As of January 1, 2020, sulfur content could not exceed 0.50% unless an approved exhaust gas cleaning system (“scrubber”) is in use. Additionally, in 
October 2018, MEPC amended Annex VI to prohibit the carriage of bunkers above 0.5% sulfur on ships on or after March 1, 2020, with the exception of vessels fitted with scrubbers which can carry fuel of higher sulfur content.
We have implemented a comprehensive approach to compliance with IMO sulfur regulations. We believe that fitting scrubbers is the most cost-effective approach to achieve compliance for the majority of the ships in our fleet. As of December 31, 2022, 48 of our 53 vessels were fitted with scrubbers, making us the largest owner of scrubber fitted Supramax/Ultramax vessels in the world. The balance of our fleet complies with the MARPOL Annex VI sulfur limit through consumption of compliant fuels.

Sulfur content standards are stricter within certain ECAs. As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA may not use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.1% unless they are equipped with scrubbers capable of reducing emissions below 0.1%. Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, certain coastal areas of North America and United States Caribbean area have been designated as ECAs. An ECA covering the Mediterranean Sea will come into effect on May 1, 2025. Ocean-going vessels in these areas will be subject to stringent emissions controls, which may cause us to incur additional costs to procure compliant fuel and/or install scrubbers. If additional ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the states where our vessels operate, compliance with these regulations could entail additional expenses relating to operation of scrubbers, purchase of compliant fuel or otherwise increase the costs of our operations.
Annex VI also establishes progressive reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from marine diesel engines installed on ships, with a “Tier II” emission limit for engines installed on a ship constructed on or after January 1, 2011; and a more stringent “Tier III” emission limit for engines installed on a ship constructed on or after January 1, 2016 operating in ECAs.
We believe we are in compliance with all current requirements of Annex VI, but we may incur additional costs to comply with more stringent standards. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Safety Management System Requirements

The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”) and the International Convention on Load Lines (the “LL Convention”) impose a variety of standards that regulate the design and operational features of ships. The IMO periodically revises the SOLAS and LL Convention standards. In addition, the Convention of Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims establishes limits of liability for loss of life or personal injury claim and property claims against shipowners.

The operation of our ships is also affected by Chapter IX of SOLAS, which sets forth the IMO’s International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention (the “ISM Code”). The ISM Code requires shipowners and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive Safety Management System (“SMS”) that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for emergency response. We rely upon the SMS that we have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. As of the date of this filing, all of the vessels in our owned fleet are ISM code-certified. 

The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate (“SMC”) for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel’s operators with the ISM Code requirements for a SMS. No vessel can obtain a SMC under the ISM Code unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance (“DoC”) issued by the vessel’s flag state or by an approved organization on behalf of the flag state. Our in-house technical managers have obtained DoC for all offices and safety management certificates for all of our vessels for which the certificates are required by the IMO, which certificates are renewed as needed.
Pollution Control and Liability Requirements

The IMO has implemented international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions. For example, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (“BWM Convention”) is designed to protect the marine environment from the introduction of non-native (alien) species as a result of the carrying of ships’ ballast water from one place to another. The BWM Convention was adopted in 2004 and became effective on September 8, 2017. The BWM Convention is applicable to new and existing vessels that are designed to carry ballast water. It defines a discharge standard consisting of maximum allowable levels of critical invasive species. This standard is met by installing BWTS that render the invasive species non-viable. In addition, each vessel is required to have on board a valid International Ballast Water Management Certificate, a Ballast Water Management Plan and a Ballast Water Record Book. 
Under relevant U.S. federal laws, U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”) approved BWTS are required to be installed in all vessels at the first out of water drydocking after January 1, 2016 if these vessels are to discharge ballast water inside 12 nautical miles of the coast of the United States. An Alternative Management System (“AMS”) may be installed in lieu of a USCG approved BWTS. An AMS is valid for five years from the date of required compliance with ballast water discharge standards, by which time it must be replaced by an approved system unless the AMS itself achieves approval.
In 2018, the Company entered into a contract for the purchase of BWTS for its owned vessels. As of December 31, 2022, 48 of our owned vessels have BWTS installed. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $8.2 million in Vessels and vessel improvements in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to the acquisition and installation of BWTS. As of December 31, 2022, the Company made payments of $2.0 million related to BWTS that are expected to be acquired and installed during scheduled drydockings in 2023 and are recorded in Advances for ballast water systems and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (the “Bunker Convention”) to impose strict liability on shipowners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker Convention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, as amended). With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ships’ bunkers typically is determined by national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur. Our ships carry bunker pollution insurance in excess of the statutory requirements.

In March 2006, the IMO amended Annex I to MARPOL, including a regulation relating to oil fuel tank protection, which became effective August 1, 2007. The regulation applies to various ships delivered on or after August 1, 2010. The requirements it contains address issues such as fuel tanks, protected location accidental oil fuel outflow performance standards, a tank capacity limit and certain other maintenance, inspection and engineering standards.

IMO regulations also require owners and operators of certain vessels to adopt Ship Oil Pollution Emergency Plans. Periodic training and drills for response personnel and for vessels and their crews are required.
In March 2021, the U.S. government began investigating an allegation that one of the Company’s vessels may have improperly disposed of ballast water that entered the engine room bilges during a repair. The investigation of this alleged violation of environmental laws is ongoing, and although at this time we do not believe that this matter will have a material impact on the Company, our financial condition or results of operations, we cannot determine what penalties, if any, will be imposed. We have posted a surety bond as security for any potential fines, penalties or associated costs that may be incurred, and the Company is cooperating fully with the U.S. government in its investigation of this matter. 

Anti-Fouling Requirements

In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships (the “Anti-Fouling Convention”). The Anti-Fouling Convention prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels. Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages are required to undergo an initial survey before the vessel is put into service or before an International Anti-Fouling System Certificate is issued for the first time and subsequent surveys when the anti-fouling systems are altered or replaced. 
In November 2020, MEPC 75 approved draft amendments to the Anti-Fouling Convention to prohibit anti-fouling systems containing cybutryne. These amendments were adopted at MEPC 76 in June 2021 and will apply to ships from January 1, 2023.
We have obtained Anti-Fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti-Fouling Convention.

Compliance Enforcement
The flag state, as defined by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, is responsible for implementing and enforcing a broad range of international maritime regulations with respect to all ships granted the right to fly its flag. The “Shipping Industry Guidelines on Flag State Performance” evaluates and reports on flag states based on factors such as sufficiency of infrastructure, ratification, implementation, and enforcement of principal international maritime treaties, supervision of statutory ship surveys, casualty investigations, and participation at IMO and ILO meetings. Our vessels are flagged in the Marshall Islands. Marshall Islands-flagged vessels have historically received a good assessment in the shipping industry. We recognize the importance of a credible flag state and do not intend to use flag states with poor performance indicators.
Non-compliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels or result in the denial of access to, or detention in some ports. As of the date of this report, each of our vessels is ISM Code certified and it is our intent to maintain ISM code certification. However, there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in the future.

The IMO continues to introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulations may have on our operations.
The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all “owners and operators” whose vessels trade with the United States, its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in United States waters, which includes the United States’ territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the United States. The United States has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define “owner or operator,” in the case of a vessel, as “any person owning, operating or chartering by demise,” the vessel. Both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations.

Under OPA, vessel owners and operators are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels, unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. OPA defines these other damages broadly to include:

•Injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs;
•Injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property;
•Net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural resources;
•Loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed, or lost;
•Lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and
•Net cost of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and loss of subsistence use of natural resources.
OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs. Effective March 23, 2023, the USCG adjusted the limits of OPA liability for non-tank vessels (e.g. drybulk) to the greater of $1,300 per gross ton or $1,076,000 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). These limits of liability may not apply if an incident was caused by the violation of an applicable United States federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly may not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident where the responsibility party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.

CERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damage for, injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo or residue and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or gross negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA.
OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We have complied with the regulations by providing a certificate of financial responsibility from third party entities that are acceptable to the USCG.

We currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1.0 billion per incident for each of our vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverages, it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.

OPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law. Also, OPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, provided they accept, at a minimum, the levels of liability established under OPA; some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills. In some cases, states which have enacted such legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners’ responsibilities under these laws. We intend to comply with all applicable state regulations in the ports where our 
vessels call. We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable existing state requirements. In addition, we intend to comply with all future applicable state regulations in the ports where our vessels call.
Other Environmental Initiatives
The United States Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in United States navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. Furthermore, many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than United States federal law. In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) expanded the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”), thereby expanding federal authority under the CWA. However, in April 2020, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule replacing the 2015 rules, and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the CWA. On August 30, 2021, a federal court struck down the replacement rule and, on December 7, 2021, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule that would put back into place the pre-2015 definition of “waters of the United States,” updated to reflect Supreme Court decisions, while the agencies continue to consult with stakeholders on future regulatory actions. As a result of such recent developments, substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the CWA.

The EPA and the USCG have enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, which requires the installation of equipment on vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures. The EPA will regulate these ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within United States waters pursuant to the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which was signed into law on December 4, 2018 and replaces the 2013 Vessel General Permit (“VGP”) program (which authorizes discharges incidental to operations of commercial vessels and contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels) and current USCG ballast water management regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act (“NISA”). VIDA establishes a new framework for the regulation of vessel incidental discharges under the CWA, requires the EPA to develop performance standards for those discharges within two years of enactment, and requires the USCG to develop implementation, compliance, and enforcement regulations within two years of EPA’s promulgation of standards. Under VIDA, all provisions of the 2013 VGP and USCG regulations regarding ballast water treatment remain in force and effect until the EPA and USCG regulations are finalized. Non-military, non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with the requirements of the VGP, including submission of a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) or retention of a PARI form and submission of annual reports. On October 26, 2020, the EPA published a proposed rule establishing national standards for discharges of ballast water under VIDA. Within two years after the EPA publishes its final standards, the USCG must develop corresponding implementation, compliance, and enforcement regulations regarding ballast water.

In addition, certain states have enacted additional discharge standards beyond the requirements of the VIDA. These state specific standards introduce more stringent requirements, such as those further restricting ballast water discharges and preventing the introduction of invasive species. The VIDA and state-specific regulations and any similar restrictions enacted in the future may increase the costs of operating in the relevant waters.

The U.S. Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to certain air pollutants, including volatile organic compounds. The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”) designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in each state. State-specific SIPs may include regulations concerning emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations, including the installation of vapor control equipment.

Our operations occasionally generate and require the transportation, treatment and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA,”) or comparable state, local or foreign requirements. The RCRA imposes significant record keeping 
and reporting requirements on transporters of hazardous waste. In addition, from time to time we arrange for the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances at off-site disposal facilities. If such materials are improperly disposed of by third parties, we may still be held liable for cleanup costs under applicable laws.

In October 2009, the EU amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. Member States were required to enact laws or regulations to comply with the directive by the end of 2010. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag, but certain exceptions apply to warships or where human safety or the safety of the ship is in danger.
The European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as determined by type, age, and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. Regulations also provided the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply. Furthermore, the EU has implemented regulations requiring vessels to use reduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. The EU Directive 2005/33/EC (amending Directive 1999/32/EC) introduced requirements parallel to those in Annex VI relating to the sulfur content of marine fuels. 
Greenhouse Gas Regulation

Currently, GHG emissions from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with targets extended through 2020. International negotiations are continuing with respect to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, and restrictions on shipping emissions may be included in any new treaty. In December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the U.S. and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016 and does not directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from ships. Although the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020, the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021, following a January 20, 2021, executive order by U.S. President Biden.
Although the international agreements discussed above do not currently provide for GHG emissions limits or reporting for international shipping, the IMO and EU have imposed reporting requirements and the IMO has proposed emissions requirements. As of January 1, 2019, owners and operators of ships above 5,000 gross tonnage are required to have a documented plan in place to monitor CO2 emissions to comply with the IMO’s data collection system (“IMO DCS”) requirement. The Company updated its existing Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans (“SEEMP”) in 2018 documenting the methodologies we decided to use for collecting and reporting the required data to flag state. Our updated SEEMPs have been verified by a recognized independent organization and we are collecting all relevant data in our onboard data collection system since the start of 2019. Starting January 1, 2020, a recognized independent organization will review and certify the annual emissions data submitted by each vessel and issue each vessel a Statement of Compliance. The independent organization will then submit the data annually to the IMO Ship Fuel Oil Consumption Database. The IMO will utilize this data to produce an annual report to the MEPC, summarizing the data collected.
The Company also established and received approval for its EU Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (“MRV”) monitoring plans from an independent verifier in 2017. The reporting requirements of the EU MRV are similar to those under IMO DCS but only apply to ships calling at European Economic Area (EU, Norway and Iceland) ports. Data collection takes place on a per voyage basis and started January 1, 2018. The reported CO2 emissions, together with additional data, are independently verified before being sent to a central database managed by the European Maritime Safety Agency (“EMSA”). The aggregated ship emission and efficiency data is published annually by the 
22


European Commission starting June 30, 2019. Also, on July 14, 2021, the European Commission adopted a series of legislative proposals setting out how it intends to achieve climate neutrality in the EU by 2050, including extending its emissions trading system (“ETS”) to the maritime sector. In 2022, the European Parliament (EP), the Council of the European Union and the European Commission reached an agreement on including shipping in the EU’s Emission Trading System (“EU ETS”), beginning in 2024. Subject to final adoption during 2023, the extension of the emissions trading system will cover CO2 emissions from ships above 5,000 gross tonnage. The obligations will be gradually phased in over a three--year period, such that allowances for 100% of verified emissions would not be required for several years. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of shipping’s inclusion in the EU ETS will have on the Company and its operations. 
During MEPC 76 in June 2021, the IMO approved amendments to Annex VI to cut the carbon intensity of existing ships. The amendments will require ships to combine a technical and an operational approach to reduce their carbon intensity, in line with the ambition of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, which aims to reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40% by 2030, compared to 2008. The amendments include (1) a technical requirement to reduce carbon intensity based on a new Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (“EEXI”) and (2) operational carbon intensity reduction requirements, based on a new operational carbon intensity indicator (“CII”). These amendments entered into force on November 1, 2022, with the requirements for EEXI and CII certification coming into effect from January 1, 2023. The Company has evaluated the impact of EEXI requirements and determined that the majority of our fleet will be minimally impacted with some of the oldest ships requiring the application of an engine power limitation that may reduce operational top speed. The Company is working with Class and Flag to complete the EEXI certification of all vessels by the applicable statutory deadline which is the first periodical survey date for each ship within 2023. EEXI requirements will ultimately lead the oldest ships in the drybulk fleet to slow down significantly which will limit drybulk supply and could positively impact rates. The Company updated its existing SEEMP in 2022 documenting the methodologies we decided to use for complying with the CII requirements. Our updated SEEMPs have been verified by a recognized independent organization and we are collecting all relevant data in our onboard data collection system since the start of 2019. The Company sees limited impact through 2025 by which time the IMO will begin a review of the CII requirements. The most immediate impact of CII requirements coming into effect will likely be the need for increased collaboration between the Company and charterers to actively manage CII scoring against minimum requirements.
Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the EU, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement, that restricts emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time. Revenue generation and strategic growth opportunities may also be adversely affected. Even in the absence of climate control legislation, our business may be indirectly affected to the extent that climate change may result in sea level changes or more intense weather events such as those which may present a risk of damage or loss to our vessels.
Vessel Security Regulations

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”). To implement certain portions of the MTSA, in July 2003, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The regulations also impose requirements on certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA. We have implemented measures to comply with the requirements when calling at U.S. ports.

Similarly, in December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security. The new Chapter V became effective in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (“ISPS Code”). The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. Amendments to SOLAS Chapter VII, made mandatory in 2004, apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code. To trade 
internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state. Among the various requirements are:
•On-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship’s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status;
•On board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore; the development of vessel security plans;
•Ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel’s hull;
•A continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel’s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship’s identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and
•Compliance with flag state security certification requirements.

Ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained at port until it obtains an ISSC, or it may be expelled from port, or refused entry at port.

Furthermore, additional security measures could be required in the future which could have a significant financial impact on us. The USCG regulations, intended to be aligned with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures, provided such vessels have on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel’s compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. Our vessels have a valid ISSC and it is our intent to maintain such certificates. We have implemented the various security measures addressed by the MTSA, SOLAS and the ISPS Code.
Financial Regulations

Our business operations in countries outside the United States are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the FCPA, as well as economic sanctions and trade embargoes administered by Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The FCPA prohibits bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. OFAC administers and enforces economic sanctions and trade embargoes based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. 

In November 2015, the Company filed a voluntary self-disclosure report with OFAC regarding certain apparent violations of U.S. sanctions regulations in the provision of shipping services for third party charterers with respect to the transportation of cargo to or from Myanmar (formerly Burma). The Company had a different senior management team at the time of the apparent violations which occurred between 2011 and 2014. The Company’s new senior management and new Board of Directors self-reported the apparent violation and cooperated fully with OFAC’s investigation and has since implemented robust remedial measures and significantly enhanced its compliance safeguards. 
On January 23, 2020, Eagle Shipping International (USA) LLC (“ESI”), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a settlement agreement with OFAC in which ESI agreed to make a one-time payment to the U.S. Department of the Treasury in the amount of $1.125 million and undertake certain compliance commitments in exchange for OFAC agreeing to release and forever discharge the Company and its subsidiaries, including ESI, without any finding of fault, from any and all civil liability in connection with the apparent violations. The settlement does not constitute an admission of fault or wrongdoing by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Inspection by Classification Societies

Every ocean-going vessel must be inspected and certified by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the vessel is “in class,” signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned.
The classification society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.

For maintenance of the class certification, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classed are required to be performed as follows:

•Annual Surveys. For ocean-going ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant, and where applicable for special equipment classed, within three months before or after each anniversary date of the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate.
•Intermediate Surveys. Intermediate surveys typically are required two and one-half years after the vessel is commissioned, and thereafter, at five year intervals. The first three intermediate surveys may be conducted while the vessel remains in the water, and thereafter, the vessel must be dry-docked for each Intermediate Survey.
•Class Renewal Surveys. Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. At the special survey the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the classification society would prescribe steel renewals. The classification society may grant a one year grace period for completion of the special survey. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey approximately every five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a shipowner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five year cycle. At an owner’s application, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal.

All areas subject to survey as defined by the classification society are required to be surveyed at least once per class period, unless shorter intervals between surveys are prescribed elsewhere. The period between two subsequent surveys of each area must not exceed five years.

Most vessels are also drydocked every 30 to 60 months for inspection of the underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a “recommendation” which must be rectified by the shipowner within prescribed time limits.

Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in class” by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (the “IACS”). In December 2013, the IACS adopted new harmonized Common Structure Rules, which apply to bulkcarriers constructed on or after July 1, 2015. All our vessels must be certified as being “in class” prior to their delivery under our standard purchase contracts and memorandum of agreement. If the vessel is not class certified on the date of closing, we have no obligation to take delivery of the vessel. We have all of our vessels and intend to have all vessels that we acquire in the future, classed by IACS members.
Risk of Loss and Liability Insurance

General

The operation of any drybulk vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of a marine casualty, including oil spills (e.g., fuel oil), other environmental mishaps and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. OPA, which imposes liability upon owners, operators and demise charterers of vessels trading in the United States exclusive economic zone for certain oil pollution accidents in the United States, has made liability insurance more expensive for shipowners and operators trading in the U.S. market.
While we maintain hull and machinery insurance, loss of hire insurance, war risks insurance, protection and indemnity cover and freight, demurrage and defense cover for our owned fleet in amounts that we believe to be prudent to cover normal risks in our operations, we may not be able to achieve or maintain this level of coverage throughout a vessel’s useful life. Furthermore, while we believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate, not all risks can be insured and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid or that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates.
Hull & Machinery and War Risks Insurance
We maintain marine hull, machinery and war risks insurances, which cover the risk of damage or actual or constructive total loss for all of our vessels. Our vessels are each covered up to at least their fair market value with a deductible of $100,000 per vessel per incident.
Protection and Indemnity Insurance Coverage

Protection and Indemnity Insurance is a form of mutual indemnity insurance provided by protection and indemnity associations (“P&I Associations”), which insure our third-party liabilities in connection with our shipping activities. This includes third-party liability and other related expenses resulting from the injury, illness or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, the loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third-party property, pollution and other related costs, including wreck removal. Subject to the “capping” discussed below except for pollution is unlimited.
Our current Protection and Indemnity Insurance coverage for pollution is $1.0 billion per vessel per incident. The 13 P&I Associations that comprise the International Group of P&I Association insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities. As a member of a P&I Association which is a member of the International Group, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on the Company’s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group.
Competition

We compete with a large number of international drybulk owners. The international shipping industry is highly competitive and fragmented with no single owner accounting for more than 2.6%(1) of the on-the-water drybulk fleet, measured by vessel count, as of December 31, 2022. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, there are approximately 13,100 drybulk vessels(1) over 10,000 dwt which total approximately 972 million dwt(1). We compete with other owners of drybulk vessels, primarily in the midsize segment and (to a lesser extent) the Handysize and Panamax segments. Many of our competitors are privately-held companies.
Competition in the shipping industry varies according to the nature of the contractual relationship as well as the specific commodity being shipped. Our business will fluctuate as a result of changes in the supply and demand for 
drybulk commodities and also the main patterns of trade in these commodities. Competition in virtually all bulk trades is intense and based primarily on supply of ships and demand for our ocean transportation services. We compete for charters on the basis of price, vessel location, size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator. Increasingly, major customers are demonstrating a preference for modern vessels based on concerns about the environmental and operational risks associated with older vessels. Consequently, we believe owners of large modern fleets have gained a competitive advantage over owners of older fleets.

Seasonality
Demand for vessel capacity has historically exhibited seasonal variations and, as a result, fluctuations in freight rates. This seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results for our vessels trading in the spot market. The midsize drybulk market, as measured by the BSI, is typically strongest in the fall (due to both increased North American grain shipments and higher coal purchases for heating fuel ahead of the cold winter months). There is also seasonal volatility in the relative strength of the Atlantic basin as compared to the Pacific basin. From 2016 through 2022, the long-term average market premium in the Atlantic basin was approximately 30%(1). This premium is generally highest in the months of December through February, primarily attributable to a general market slowdown in the weeks leading up to the Lunar New Year and due to an elevated number of newbuild vessels that are typically delivered in January, relative to other months.

Value of Assets and Cash Requirements

The replacement costs of comparable new vessels may be above or below the book value of our fleet. The market value of our fleet may be below book value when market conditions are weak and exceed book value when markets are strong. In common with other shipowners, we may consider asset redeployment which at times may include the sale of vessels at less than their book value.   
Exchange Controls

Under Marshall Islands law, there are currently no restrictions on the export or import of capital, including foreign exchange controls or restrictions that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of our common stock.
Tax Considerations

The following is a discussion of the material Marshall Islands and United States federal income tax considerations relevant to owning common stock by a United States Holder or a Non-United States Holder, (each as defined herein). This discussion does not purport to deal with the tax consequences of owning the common stock to all categories of investors, some of which (such as financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, persons holding our common stock as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons who are investors in pass-through entities, dealers in securities or currencies, persons required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is reported on an “applicable financial statement,” persons subject to the “base erosion and anti-avoidance” tax, persons who own, directly or constructively, 10% or more of our common stock and investors whose functional currency is not the United States dollar) may be subject to special rules. This discussion deals only with holders who own common stock as a capital asset. Shareholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the overall tax consequences arising 
in their own particular situation under United States federal, state, local or foreign law of the ownership of our common stock.

Marshall Islands Tax Considerations

In the opinion of Seward & Kissel LLP, the following are the material Marshall Islands tax consequences of our activities to us and shareholders of our common stock. We are incorporated in the Marshall Islands. Under current Marshall Islands law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains and no Marshall Islands withholding tax will be imposed upon payments of dividends by us to our shareholders.
United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

In the opinion of Seward & Kissel LLP, our United States tax counsel, the following are the material United States federal income tax consequences to us of our activities and to United States Holders and to Non-United States Holders of our common stock. The following discussion of United States federal income tax matters is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements and existing and proposed regulations issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. In addition, the discussion below is based, in part, on the description of our business as described in Item 1. Business in this Annual Report and assumes that we conduct our business as described in that section.

We have made, or will make, special United States federal income tax elections in respect of each of our ship owning or operating subsidiaries that is potentially subject to tax as a result of deriving income attributable to the transportation of cargoes to or from the United States. The effect of the special U.S. tax elections is to ignore or disregard the subsidiaries for which elections have been made as separate taxable entities and to treat them as part of their parent, the “Company.” Therefore, for purposes of the following discussion, the Company, and not the subsidiaries subject to this special election, will be treated as the owner and operator of the vessels and as receiving the income therefrom.
United States Federal Income Taxation of Our Company

Taxation of Operating Income: In General

The Company currently earns, and anticipates that it will continue to earn, substantially all its income from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time or voyage charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses, all of which we refer to as “shipping income.”
Unless exempt from United States federal income taxation under the rules of Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”), as discussed below, a foreign corporation such as Eagle will be subject to United States federal income taxation on its “shipping income” that is treated as derived from sources within the United States, to which we refer as “United States source shipping income.” For tax purposes, “United States source shipping income” includes 50% of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States.
Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-United States ports will be considered to be 100% derived from sources outside the United States. Shipping income derived from sources outside the United States will not be subject to any United States federal income tax.
Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between United States ports is considered to be 100% derived from United States sources. However, the Company is not permitted by United States law to engage in the transportation of cargoes that produces 100% United States source income.

Unless exempt from tax under Section 883, the Company’s gross United States source shipping income would be subject to a 4% tax imposed without allowance for deductions as described below.

Exemption of Operating Income from United States Federal Income Taxation

Under Section 883 and the regulations thereunder, a foreign corporation will be exempt from United States federal income taxation on its United States source shipping income if:
•it is organized in a qualified foreign country, which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the United States in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883 and to which we refer as the “Country of Organization Test”; and
•one of the following tests is met:
◦more than 50% of the value of its shares is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which as defined includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country, to which we refer as the “50% Ownership Test”;
◦subject to an exception for closely-held corporations, its shares are “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in a qualified foreign country or in the United States, to which we refer as the “Publicly-Traded Test”; or
◦it is a “controlled foreign corporation” and satisfies an ownership test, to which, collectively, we refer to as the “CFC Test.”
The Republic of the Marshall Islands, the jurisdiction where the Company is incorporated, has been officially recognized by the United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) as a qualified foreign country that grants the requisite “equivalent exemption” from tax in respect of each category of shipping income the Company earns and currently expects to earn in the future. Therefore, the Company will be exempt from United States federal income taxation with respect to its United States source shipping income if it satisfies any one of the 50% Ownership Test, the Publicly-Traded Test, or the CFC Test. 
For our 2022 taxable year, we believe that we satisfied the Publicly-Traded Test, as discussed in more detail below. The Company does not currently anticipate a circumstance under which it would be able to satisfy the 50% Ownership Test or the CFC Test.
Publicly-Traded Test

The regulations under Section 883 provide, in pertinent part, that shares of a foreign corporation will be considered to be “primarily traded” on an established securities market in a country if the number of shares of each class of shares that are traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of shares in each such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country. For the 2022 taxable year, the Company’s common stock, which is its sole class of issued and outstanding shares, was “primarily traded” on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Under the regulations, the Company’s common stock will be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market if one or more classes of its shares representing more than 50% of its outstanding shares, by both total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote and total value, are listed on such market, to which we refer as the “listing threshold.” Since our common stock, which is our sole class of issued and outstanding shares, was listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we believe that we satisfy the listing threshold.

It is further required that with respect to each class of shares relied upon to meet the listing threshold, (i) such class of shares is traded on the market, other than in minimal quantities, on at least 60 days during the taxable year or one-sixth of the days in a short taxable year; and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of such class of shares traded on such market during the taxable year is at least 10% of the average number of shares of such class of shares outstanding during such year or as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year. We believe the Company will satisfy the trading frequency and trading volume tests. Even if this were not the case, the regulations 
provide that the trading frequency and trading volume tests will be deemed satisfied if, as is the case with the Company’s common stock, such class of shares is traded on an established market in the United States and such shares are regularly quoted by dealers making a market in such shares.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the regulations provide, in pertinent part, that a class of shares will not be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for any taxable year in which 50% or more of the vote and value of the outstanding shares of such class are owned, actually or constructively under specified share attribution rules, on more than half the days during the taxable year by persons who each own 5% or more of the vote and value of such class of outstanding shares, to which we refer as the “5 Percent Override Rule.”

For purposes of being able to determine the persons who actually or constructively own 5% or more of the vote and value of the Company’s common stock (“5% Shareholders”), the regulations permit the Company to rely on those persons that are identified on Schedule 13G and Schedule 13D filings with the SEC, as owning 5% or more of the Company’s common stock. The regulations further provide that an investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, will not be treated as a 5% Shareholder for such purposes.

In the event the 5 Percent Override Rule is triggered, the regulations provide that the 5 Percent Override Rule will nevertheless not apply if the Company can establish that within the group of 5% Shareholders, there are sufficient qualified shareholders for purposes of Section 883 to preclude non-qualified shareholders in such group from owning 50% or more of the Company's common stock for more than half the number of days during the taxable year, which we refer to as the “5 Percent Override Exception.”

Based on the ownership and trading of our stock in 2022, we believe that we satisfied the publicly traded test and qualified for the Section 883 exemption in 2022. Even if we do qualify for the Section 883 exemption in 2022, there can be no assurance that changes and shifts in the ownership of our stock by 5% shareholders will not preclude us from qualifying for the Section 883 exemption in future taxable years. 
Taxation in Absence of Section 883 Exemption
If the benefits of Section 883 are unavailable, the Company’s United States source shipping income would be subject to a 4% tax imposed by Section 887 of the Code on a gross basis, without the benefit of deductions, to the extent that such income is not considered to be “effectively connected” with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below. Since under the sourcing rules described above, no more than 50% of the Company’s shipping income would be treated as being United States source shipping income, the maximum effective rate of United States federal income tax on our shipping income would never exceed 2% under the 4% gross basis tax regime. Based on the current operation of our vessels, if we were subject to 4% gross basis tax, our United States federal income tax liability would be approximately $4.6 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. However, we can give no assurance that the operation of our vessels, which are under the control of third party charterers, will not change such that our United States federal income tax liability would be substantially higher.

To the extent the Company’s United States source shipping income is considered to be “effectively connected” with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below, any such “effectively connected” United States source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, would be subject to United States federal income tax, currently imposed at a rate of 21%. In addition, the Company may be subject to the 30% “branch profits” tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of the Company's United States trade or business.

The Company’s United States source shipping income would be considered “effectively connected” with the conduct of a United States trade or business only if:
•the Company has, or is considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of United States source shipping income; and
•substantially all of the Company’s United States source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.

United States Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels

Assuming that any decision on a vessel sale is made from and attributable to the United States office of the Company, as we believe likely to be the case as the Company is currently structured, then any gain derived from the sale of any such vessel will be treated as derived from United States sources and subject to United States federal income tax as “effectively connected” income (determined under rules different from those discussed above) under the above described net income tax regime. If the Company were to qualify for exemption from tax under Section 883 in respect of the shipping income derived from the international operation of its vessels, then gain from the sale of any such vessel should likewise be exempt from tax under Section 883.
United States Federal Income Taxation of United States Holders

As used herein, the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is an individual United States citizen or resident, a United States corporation or other United States entity taxable as a corporation, an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has in place an election to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
If a partnership holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common stock, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor.
Distributions

Subject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies below, any distributions made by the Company with respect to its common stock to a United States Holder will generally constitute dividends to the extent of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of such earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the United States Holder’s tax basis in his common stock on a dollar-for-dollar basis and thereafter as capital gain. Because the Company is not a United States corporation, United States Holders that are corporations will not be entitled to claim a dividend received deduction with respect to any distributions they receive from us. Dividends paid with respect to the Company’s common stock will generally be treated as “passive category income” for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for United States foreign tax credit purposes.
Dividends paid on the Company’s common stock to a United States Holder who is an individual, trust or estate (a “United States Non-Corporate Holder”) will generally be treated as “qualified dividend income” that is taxable to such United States Non-Corporate Holder at preferential tax rates provided that (1) the common stock is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the New York Stock Exchange on which the Company’s common stock is traded); (2) the Company is not a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year (which we do not believe we have been, are or will be); (3) the United States Non-Corporate Holder has owned the common stock for more than 60 days in the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on which the common stock becomes ex-dividend; and (4) the United States Non-Corporate Holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property.
There is no assurance that any dividends paid on the Company’s common stock will be eligible for these preferential rates in the hands of a United States Non-Corporate Holder, although we believe that they will be so eligible. Any dividends out of earnings, and profits the Company pays, which are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed as ordinary income to a United States Non-Corporate Holder.

Special rules may apply to any “extraordinary dividend,” generally, a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10% of a shareholder’s adjusted basis in a common share paid by the Company. If the Company pays an “extraordinary dividend” on its common stock that is treated as “qualified dividend income,” then any loss derived by a United States Non-Corporate Holder from the sale or exchange of such common stock will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend.
Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock

Assuming the Company does not constitute a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the United States Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the United States Holder’s tax basis in such stock. Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the United States Holder’s holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source income or loss, as applicable, for United States foreign tax credit purposes. Long-term capital gains of United States Non-Corporate Holders are currently eligible for reduced rates of taxation. A United States Holder’s ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain limitations.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences

Special United States federal income tax rules apply to a United States Holder that holds shares in a foreign corporation classified as a “passive foreign investment company” for United States federal income tax purposes. In general, the Company will be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to a United States Holder if, for any taxable year in which such holder holds the Company’s common stock, either:
•at least 75% of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business); or
•at least 50% of the average value of our assets during such taxable year produce, or are held for the production of, passive income
Income earned, or deemed earned, by the Company in connection with the performance of services would not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income would generally constitute “passive income” unless the Company was treated under specific rules as deriving its rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business.

Based on the Company’s current operations and future projections, we do not believe that the Company has been or is, nor do we expect the Company to become, a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year. Although there is no legal authority directly on point, our belief is based principally on the position that, for purposes of determining whether the Company is a passive foreign investment company, the gross income it derives from its time chartering and voyage chartering activities should constitute services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, such income should not constitute passive income, and the assets that the Company owns and operates in connection with the production of such income, in particular, the vessels, should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether the Company is a passive foreign investment company.

We believe there is substantial legal authority supporting our position consisting of case law and IRS pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, there is also authority which characterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. In addition, we have obtained an opinion from our counsel, Seward & Kissel LLP, that, based upon the Company’s operations as described herein, its income from 
time charters and voyage charters should not be treated as passive income for purposes of determining whether it is a passive foreign investment company. However, in the absence of any legal authority specifically relating to the statutory provisions governing passive foreign investment companies, the United States Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. In addition, although the Company intends to conduct its affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of its operations will not change in the future.
As discussed more fully below, if the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder would be subject to different taxation rules depending on whether the United States Holder makes an election to treat the Company as a “Qualified Electing Fund,” which election we refer to as a “QEF election.” As an alternative to making a QEF election, a United States Holder should be able to make a “mark-to-market” election with respect to the Company’s common stock, as discussed below. In addition, if we were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company, a United States holder would be required to file an annual report with the IRS for that year with respect to such holder’s common stock.

Taxation of United States Holders Making a Timely QEF Election

If a United States Holder makes a timely QEF election, which United States Holder we refer to as an “Electing Holder,” the Electing Holder must report for United States federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the Company’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain, if any, for each taxable year of the Company for which it is a passive foreign investment company that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder, regardless of whether or not distributions were received from the Company by the Electing Holder. No portion of any such inclusions of ordinary earnings will be treated as “qualified dividend income.” Net capital gain inclusions of United States Non-Corporate Holders would be eligible for preferential capital gains tax rates. The Electing Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common stock will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that had been previously taxed will result in a corresponding reduction in the adjusted tax basis in the common stock and will not be taxed again once distributed. An Electing Holder would not, however, be entitled to a deduction for its pro rata share of any losses that the Company incurs with respect to any year. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock. A United States Holder would make a timely QEF election for shares of the Company by filing one copy of IRS Form 8621 with his United States federal income tax return for the first year in which he held such shares when the Company was a passive foreign investment company. If the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, the Company would provide each United States Holder with all necessary information in order to make the QEF election described above.
Taxation of United States Holders Making a “Mark-to-Market” Election

Alternatively, if the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year and, as we anticipate, its shares are treated as “marketable stock”, a United States Holder would be allowed to make a “mark-to-market” election with respect to the Company’s common stock, provided the United States Holder completes and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions and related Treasury regulations. If that election is made, the United States Holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of the taxable year over such holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common stock. The United States Holder would also be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common stock over its fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A United States Holder’s tax basis in his common stock would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount. Gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock would be treated as ordinary income and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included by the United States Holder. No income inclusions under this election will be treated as “qualified dividend income.”
Taxation of United States Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or Mark-to-Market Election

Finally, if the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder who does not make either a QEF election or a “mark-to-market” election for that year, whom we refer to as a “Non-Electing Holder” would be subject to special rules with respect to (1) any excess distribution (i.e., the portion of any distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder on the common stock in a taxable year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, the Non-Electing Holder’s holding period for the common stock) and (2) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock. Under these special rules:
•the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non-Electing Holder’s aggregate holding period for the common stock;
•the amount allocated to the current taxable year, and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which the Company was a passive foreign investment company, would be taxed as ordinary income and would not be “qualified dividend income”; and
•the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year.
These special rules would not apply to a qualified pension, profit sharing or other retirement trust or other tax-exempt organization that did not borrow money or otherwise utilize leverage in connection with its acquisition of the Company’s common stock. If the Company is a passive foreign investment company and a Non-Electing Holder who is an individual dies while owning the Company’s common stock, such holder’s successor generally would not receive a step-up in tax basis with respect to such shares.
United States Federal Income Taxation of “Non-United States Holders”

A beneficial owner of common stock (other than a partnership) that is not a United States Holder is referred to herein as a “Non-United States Holder.”

If a partnership holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common stock, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor.
Dividends on Common Stock

Non-United States Holders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on dividends received from the Company with respect to its common stock, unless that income is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the Non-United States Holder is entitled to the benefits of a United States income tax treaty with respect to those dividends, that income is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States Holder in the United States.
Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock

Non-United States Holders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock, unless:

•The gain is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if the Non-United States holder is entitled to the benefits of an income tax treaty with respect to that gain, that gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States holder in the United States); or
•The Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and other conditions are met.

If the Non-United States Holder is engaged in a United States trade or business for United States federal income tax purposes, the income from the common stock, including dividends and the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of the shares, that is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business will generally be subject to regular United States federal income tax in the same manner as discussed in the previous section relating to the taxation of United States Holders. In addition, if you are a corporate Non-United States Holder, your earnings and profits that are attributable to the effectively connected income, which are subject to certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

In general, dividend payments, or other taxable distributions, made within the United States to you will be subject to information reporting requirements if you are a non-corporate United States Holder. Such payments or distributions may also be subject to backup withholding tax if you are a non-corporate United States Holder and you:

•Fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;
•Are notified by the IRS that you have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on your federal income tax returns; or
•In certain circumstances, fail to comply with applicable certification requirements.

Non-United States Holders may be required to establish their exemption from information reporting and backup withholding by certifying their status on an appropriate IRS Form W-8.

If you are a Non-United States Holder and you sell your common stock to or through a United States office of a broker, the payment of the proceeds is subject to both United States backup withholding and information reporting unless you certify that you are a non-United States person, under penalties of perjury, or you otherwise establish an exemption. If you sell your common stock through a non-United States office of a non-United States broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment. However, United States information reporting requirements, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made to you outside the United States, if you sell your common stock through a non-United States office of a broker that is a United States person or has some other contacts with the United States. Such information reporting requirements will not apply, however, if the broker has documentary evidence in its records that you are a non-United States person and certain other conditions are met, or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. Rather, you generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a refund claim with the IRS.

Individuals who are United States Holders (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, certain United States entities and Non-United States Holders) who hold “specified foreign financial assets” (as defined in Section 6038D of the Code) are required to file IRS Form 8938 with information relating to the asset for each taxable year in which the aggregate value of all such assets exceeds $75,000 at any time during the taxable year or $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year (or such higher dollar amount as prescribed by applicable Treasury regulations). Specified foreign financial assets would include, among other assets, our common shares, unless the shares are held through an account maintained with a United States financial institution. Substantial penalties apply to any failure to timely file IRS Form 8938, unless the failure is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Additionally, in the event an individual United States Holder (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, a United States entity and Non-United States Holders) that is required to file IRS Form 8938 does not file such form, the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of United States 
federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close until three years after the date that the required information is filed. United States Holders (including United States entities) and Non-United States Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding their reporting obligations under this legislation.

Glossary of Shipping Terms
The following are definitions of shipping terms used in this Form 10-K.

Annual Survey— The inspection of a vessel by a classification society, on behalf of a flag state, that takes place every year.
Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS)— A system used to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another by minimizing the uptake and/or discharge of sediments and organisms in the water that ships use as ballast to maintain stability. These systems are required on all ships, according to a timetable of implementation, in accordance with the BWM Convention discussed in the Pollution Control and Liability Requirements section above.
Baltic Exchange—Based in London, the Baltic Exchange is a market for the trading and settlement of physical and derivative contracts. The exchange also publishes daily freight market prices and maritime shipping cost indices, including Baltic Dry Index and segment indices for Capesize, Panamax, Supramax and Handysize bulkcarriers.
Baltic Supramax Index (“BSI”) —The BSI is an index published by the Baltic Exchange which tracks the gross time charter spot value for a Supramax vessel. Initiated in 2005, the BSI was originally based on a 52,000 dwt ship of standard design and 6 trade routes across the world. As a result of a trend toward larger ship sizes and changes to trade patterns, this version of the index was discontinued as of January 31, 2019. The updated BSI is now based on a 58,000 dwt, non-scrubber fitted Supramax and 10 trade routes across the world.
Bareboat Charter—Also known as “demise charter.” Contract or hire of a ship under which the shipowner is usually paid a fixed amount of charter hire rate for a certain period of time during which the charterer is responsible for the operating costs and voyage costs of the vessel as well as arranging for crewing. Such owner is known as the bareboat charterer or the demise charterer.
Basic Charter-Free Market Value—Approximate value of a vessel that is in good condition and safely afloat on the basis of a sale for prompt charter-free delivery for cash on normal commercial terms as between a willing buyer and seller as at a point in time.
Bulk Vessels/Carriers—Vessels which are specially designed and built to carry large volumes of cargo in bulk cargo form.
Bunkers—Fuel oil used to power a vessel’s engines. The name is derived from the bins used to store coal onboard when ships were powered by coal. There are three main fuel types currently used on commercial cargo ships. First, High Sulfur Fuel Oil (“HSFO”) is a residual fuel with maximum sulfur content of 3.5%. This was the primary fuel used by commercial shipping prior to implementation of the IMO2020 sulfur regulation and continues to be used by scrubber-fitted ships. Second, Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (“VLSFO”) is a fuel with maximum sulfur content of 0.5% and is the primary fuel used by non-scrubber fitted ships starting January 1, 2020. Third, Marine Gas Oil (“MGO”) is a distillate product similar to diesel fuel and has a maximum sulfur content of 0.1%. This fuel type is primarily used in ECA zones.
Capesize—A drybulk carrier in excess of 100,000 dwt.
Carbon Intensity Indicator (“CII”)— A measure of how efficiently a vessel transports cargo, expressed in grams of CO2 emitted per cargo-carrying capacity and nautical mile.
Charter— The hire of a vessel for a specified period of time or to carry a cargo for a fixed fee from a loading port to a discharging port. The contract for a charter is called a charter party.
Charterer— The individual or company hiring a vessel.
Charter Hire Rate— A sum of money paid to the vessel owner by a charterer under a time charter party for the use of a vessel.
Classification Society—An independent organization which certifies that a vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of such organization and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of such vessel and the international conventions of which that country is a member.
Deadweight Ton (dwt)—A unit of a vessel’s capacity for cargo, fuel oil, stores and crew, measured in metric tons of 1,000 kilograms. A vessel’s dwt or total deadweight is the maximum total weight the vessel can carry when loaded to a particular load line.
Demurrage—Additional revenue paid to the shipowner on its Voyage Charters for delays experienced in loading and/or unloading cargo that are not deemed to be the responsibility of the shipowner, calculated in accordance with specific charter terms.
Despatch —The amount payable by the shipowner if the vessel completes loading or discharging before the allowed loading/unloading time has expired, calculated in accordance with specific charter terms.
Drybulk—Non-liquid cargoes of commodities shipped in an unpackaged state.
Drydocking—The removal of a vessel from the water for inspection and/or repair of submerged parts.
Emission Control Area (ECA)—Designated sea areas in which stricter airborne emissions controls are in place. The IMO has designated ECA zones that cover the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and most of the coastline of U.S., Canada and U.S. Caribbean territory. Ships operating within these zones have a maximum sulfur emissions limit of 0.1%. Beginning in 2025, the Mediterranean Sea will become an ECA.
Gross Ton—Unit of 100 cubic feet or 2.831 cubic meters used in arriving at the calculation of gross tonnage.

Panamax—A drybulk carrier of approximately 65,000 to 100,000 dwt of maximum length, depth and draft capable of passing fully loaded through the Panama Canal. Ships of this size may occasionally be equipped with onboard cargo handling equipment, but typically do not and must rely on shore-based equipment to load and unload.
Protection and Indemnity Insurance—Insurance obtained through a mutual association formed by shipowners to provide liability insurance protection from large financial loss to one member through contributions towards that loss by all members.
