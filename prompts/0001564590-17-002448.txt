Our Strategy

Our strategy is centered on the vision of enabling smarter care at virtually every point of the healthcare continuum. Given the breadth of our portfolio and global client installed base, we believe we are well positioned to connect physicians and caregivers to patients and payers to the caregivers across all healthcare settings. Smarter care is a strategic imperative for healthcare organizations globally and requires a balance between managing costs while maintaining the highest quality of care. We believe that our solutions are well-positioned to facilitate such transformation in the future of healthcare by offering community connectivity, interoperability, data analytics, and consumer engagement features and functionality. These key strategic areas all help healthcare providers better manage populations of patients, especially those with costly chronic conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, to help bring down the cost of care and improve patient outcomes.

• | Community Connectivity – Our care coordination solutions improve safety and quality as a patient transitions from one care setting to another. We help build assessments, monitor results, track outcomes, and make modifications in a person’s care plan. Healthcare is a group effort, and having full visibility into a patient’s care plan is critical. Access to comprehensive patient information is key, and our community solutions help create an organized, longitudinal patient record spanning all points of care.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Interoperability – We employ a wide array of interoperability tools to support our clients’ desire to connect to numerous stakeholders in the industry, including other healthcare providers, labs, imaging facilities, public health entities and patients, as well as other third-party technology providers. Our unique Open platform is a proven, scalable and user-friendly technology that connects both clinical and financial data across every setting. We also offer Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (“FHIR”). With this unique Open platform, clients can connect to any certified application or device, which saves time and money and gives clients full access to a variety of innovative solutions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data Analytics – Healthcare organizations need to analyze dependencies, trends, and patterns so that they can develop business and clinical intelligence to better manage patient populations. Data-driven decisions require real-time, clean data for better decisions at the point of care. Insights and analytics serve as the foundation for informed analysis and effective planning.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer Engagement – Our patient engagement software helps healthcare organizations achieve better outcomes, reduce emergency room visits, and decrease hospitalizations. Our software also integrates with solutions across an organization, regardless of a provider’s software. With a patient engagement platform, individuals and their families have the opportunity to become active members of their care team, which improves results.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Healthcare IT Industry
 The healthcare IT industry is facing significant opportunities and challenges due to ongoing regulations and changes in industry standards, and the transition to a new presidential administration in the United States is expected to also present opportunities and challenges. These include: 

• | Provider Reimbursement: In recent years, there have been significant changes to provider payment models by the United States federal government that have been followed by commercial payers and state governments. This led to increasing pressure on healthcare organizations to reduce costs and increase quality, replacing fee-for-service models in part by expanding advanced payment models, which could further encourage adoption of healthcare IT. The passage of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (“MACRA”) in 2015 codified the creation of new payment models, such as ACOs, that will significantly expand the number of ambulatory healthcare professionals delivering care under payment programs that are driven by quality measures currently under development. Many of our clients are also involved with the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus program, which is working toward similar goals by emphasizing the role of the primary care provider. Another important driver of healthcare IT adoption in the primary care space is the Patient Centered Medical Home program, a voluntary program in which many of our clients are participating and that has a strong emphasis on quality measurement and patient engagement. Even where some of these programs will likely be adjusted in part by the incoming Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Dr. Tom Price, particularly those that have been mandatory, significant levels of reimbursements will still require providers to capture, communicate, measure and share outcomes through technology solutions such as ours, given that those requirements are bound in federal statute. Further, activity related to the repeal, replacement or repair of the Affordable Care Act could have an impact on payments received by our clients for their services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ARRA/HITECH: In 2009, the United States federal government enacted the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act, which included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”). HITECH authorized the EHR Incentive program (the “Meaningful Use” program). This law provided significant incentive funding to physicians and hospitals that can prove they have adopted and are appropriately using technology such as our EHR solutions. The Meaningful Use program is currently in a state of evolution, as some of it has been incorporated into and changed by the MACRA regulations for ambulatory providers delivering care to Medicare patients; it is likely to continue as already released in the regulations associated with Stage 3 of Meaningful Use and the 2015 certification edition for Medicaid ambulatory practices and for eligible hospitals, at least for some period of time, though it may be amended or repealed as part of the new Congress’ efforts to reform Medicare and/or Medicaid.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ANSI-5010/ICD-10: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), HHS implemented a new version of the standards for HIPAA-covered electronic transactions, including claims, remittance advices, and requests and responses for eligibility, which are called ANSI-5010. Additionally, HIPAA required entities to upgrade to the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems from the World Health Organization, also known as ICD-10, for use in reporting medical diagnoses and inpatient procedures by no later than October 1, 2015. These changes in coding standards required our clients to upgrade to more advanced versions of our solutions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PPACA: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the “PPACA”), which was signed into law in 2010, has impacted us and our clients. The PPACA is expected to be repealed in part or in whole as a result of the change in presidential administration in the United States, but many components of the law, including those which have had a positive effect by requiring the expanded use of products such as ours to participate in certain federal programs, are expected to be included in any new legislation passed to replace it. Any provisions, such as those mandating reductions in reimbursement for certain types of providers or decreasing the number of covered lives in the United States or the depth of insurance coverage available to patients, may have a negative effect by reducing the resources available to our current and prospective clients to purchase our products. Further, ambiguity remains for the industry as a whole regarding the future of many programs initially authorized by the PPACA, which may slow purchasing decisions as healthcare organizations wait for clarity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that these and other changes in laws and regulations, along with increasing pressure from private payers to move providers to quality-based payment programs and market opportunities to maximize the data that is increasingly being created and captured through the care process, will continue to drive adoption of healthcare IT products and services such as ours. For example, although many large physician groups have already purchased EHR technology, we expect those groups may choose to replace their older EHR technology to comply with future Quality Payment Program requirements and to add new features and functionality.  Further, opportunities for healthcare provider organizations to expand their care coordination efforts in order to successfully comply with new payment programs or to add software specific to the precision medicine expansion, as outlined in the 21st Century Cures legislation passed in December 2016, could lead to additi
onal demand for our solutions. We also seek replacement markets for health information exchanges and patient portals, despite their recent deployment.

Business Organization
 We derive our revenues primarily from sales of our proprietary software (either as a perpetual license sale or under a subscription delivery model), which also serves as the basis for our recurring service contracts for software support and maintenance and certain transaction-related services. In addition, we provide various other client services, including installation services, and managed services solutions such as outsourcing, private cloud hosting, and revenue cycle management. 
 During 2016, in an effort to further streamline and align our operating structure around our key ambulatory, acute and population health management solutions, we made several changes to our organizational and reporting structure. These changes included (i) the separation of the former Touchworks strategic business unit and its dedicated leadership team into acute and ambulatory businesses, and (ii) the transfer of several ancillary analytics-type products between our existing Clinical and Financial Solutions and Population Health reportable segments and (iii) the establishment of the FollowMyHealth® and EPSiTM business units. In conjunction with these changes, we formed new Ambulatory and Acute strategic business units, which are deemed to be operating segments within the Clinical and Financial Solutions reportable segment. The ancillary products are extensions of our key ambulatory and acute solutions and in the future will be managed within the new Ambulatory and Acute strategic business units. Our FollowMyHealth® and EPSiTM businesses, which were previously managed as part of our Population Health reportable and operating segment, became standalone business units and operating segments.  Based on the qualitative and quantitative criteria under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we concluded that the FollowMyHealth® and EPSiTM operating segments should continue to be included as part of the Population Health reportable segment. Effective on April 19, 2016, we completed the Netsmart Transaction (as defined in Note 2, “Business Combinations and Other Investments,” in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K) which resulted in the formation of Netsmart through the merger of our HomecareTM business with Netsmart, Inc., a behavioral health technology business. Netsmart is deemed to be a separate operating and reportable segment and, therefore, is presented separately. Prior to the Netsmart Transaction, our HomecareTM business was included as part of the Population Health reportable segment. After the finalization of the above changes to our organization and reporting structure, we identified seven operating segments, which were aggregated into three reportable segments: (i) Clinical and Financial Solutions, (ii) Population Health and (iii) Netsmart.
 Information regarding financial data by segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 13, “Business Segments,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. 
 Clients 
 As of December 31, 2016, approximately 180,000 physicians, 2,500 hospitals and 45,000 post-acute networks use our products and services. Our clients, including some of the most prestigious medical groups and hospitals in the United States, often serve as a reference source for prospective clients who are interested in purchasing our solutions. No single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Research and Development
 Rapid innovation characterizes the healthcare IT industry. We believe our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the markets in which we operate. 
 Because of this, we continue to invest heavily into our research and development efforts. These efforts are primarily focused on developing new solutions as well as new features and enhancements to our existing solutions, which we believe will ensure that our solutions comply with continually evolving regulatory requirements and create additional opportunities to connect our systems to the healthcare community.
 Our total gross research and development spending was $290.4 million, $234.1 million and $233.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts consist of research and development expenses of $187.9 million, $184.8 million, and $192.8 million, and capitalized software development costs of $102.5 million, $49.3 million and $40.7 million, for each of these periods respectively. We expense research and development expenses as incurred, and we capitalize software development costs incurred from the time technological feasibility of the software is established, or when the preliminary project phase is completed in the case of internal use software, until the software is available for general release. Non-capitalizable research and development costs and other software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Competition 
 The markets for our solutions and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and solution standards and user needs, as well as frequent introduction of new solutions and services. Some of our competitors may be more established, benefit from greater name recognition, and have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. 
 Additionally, many of our prospective clients have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate competing solutions to ours. As a consequence, they may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to our solutions. Third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. 
 We compete primarily with numerous types of organizations, including developers of revenue cycle and practice management software and services, large system integrators, IT service providers, ambulatory and acute care EHR solutions, population health management and value-based care technologies, analytics systems, care management solutions and post-acute solutions. We generally compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth and depth of services (including our open architecture and the level of solution integration across care settings), integrated platform, regulatory compliance, reputation, reliability, accuracy, security, client service, total cost of ownership, innovation and industry acceptance, expertise and experience. 
 Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of potential incentives provided by government programs and as a result of consolidation in both the IT and healthcare industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.
 Our principal existing competitors in these markets include, but are not limited to (in alphabetical order) athenahealth Inc., Cerner Corporation, Change Healthcare, Computer Programs and Systems Inc., Curaspan Health Group, CureMD Healthcare, eClinicalWorks, Enli Health Intelligence, Epic Systems Corporation, Evolent Health, GE Healthcare Technologies, GE Management Systems, Healthagen, Healthcatalyst, Homecare Homebase (part of Hearst Health network), IBM Watson Health, Kareo, McKesson Corporation, MEDHOST, Inc., Medical Information Technology, Inc. (Meditech), PracticeFusion, Inc., Philips Wellcentive, Premier, Quadramed, Quality Systems, Inc., Roper Industries, T-Systems, The Advisory Board Company, The Trizetto Group, Inc. (a division of Cognizant Technology Solutions, Inc.), Vitera Healthcare Solutions and Wellsoft Corporation. 

Backlog 
 We had a contract backlog of $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $400 million or 11%. Contract backlog represents the value of bookings and support and maintenance contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Total contract backlog increased primarily due to an increase in bookings related to subscription-based agreements and managed services, such as outsourcing, private cloud hosting and revenue cycle management. We estimate that approximately 34% of our aggregate contract backlog as of December 31, 2016 will be recognized as revenue during 2017. 
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. 
 Many of our products include intellectual property obtained from third parties. For example: 
  
• | Many of our products are built on technology provided by Microsoft Corporation, such as the Microsoft SQL Server information platform, the Microsoft .NET Framework and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We license content from companies such as OptumInsight, 3M Health Information Systems, Wolters Kluwer Health, Elsevier, IMO and Clinical Architecture, which we incorporate or use in certain solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services. While we have generally been able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that we can obtain such licenses in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of continuous healthcare IT innovation, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our solutions may unknowingly infringe upon an existing patent or other intellectual property rights of others. Occasionally, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution any of these infringement notices will have a material adverse impact on our business.
 Geographic Information
 Historically, the majority of our clients and revenue have been associated with North America, where we have clients in the United States and Canada. While we remain focused on the North American market, which we expect will continue to drive our revenue in the future, we believe that there are opportunities for us globally as other countries face similar challenges of controlling healthcare costs while improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. As a result, we have increased our efforts to selectively expand the sales of many of our solutions outside of North America, primarily in the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, our domestic and international sales accounted for 97% and 3%, respectively, of our total revenue. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Note 15, “Geographic Information,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 7,500 employees worldwide. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. 
Available Information 
 Copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
