Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel immunotherapies primarily to treat cancer.  Our vision is to be a world leader in discovering, developing and commercializing T-cells to transform the treatment of patients with serious diseases. Our comprehensive SPEAR (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform enables us to identify cancer targets, find and genetically optimize T-cell receptors (TCRs), and produce SPEAR T-cells for administration to patients. Unlike certain other autologous immunotherapies our SPEAR T-cells are able to target intracellular and extracellular targets and solid and haematologic tumors.
 
Our SPEAR T-cell platform is being utilized to maximize both patient and disease indication coverage. First, we are using our platform to identify and validate cancer testis antigens for development of SPEAR T-cells. These antigens have very low expression on normal tissues and are therefore preferred targets for our SPEAR T-cells. However, within a given disease indication, the frequency of expression of these targets may be low, and may not be uniformly expressed in every cell within a tumor. As a result, we are developing multiple SPEAR T-cells to different target antigens within any disease indication to increase treatment potential for any given disease. We have three SPEAR T-cells in clinical trials which are directed to cancer testis antigens, NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A4 and MAGE-A10. The targets to which these SPEAR T-cells are directed are expressed in multiple disease indications including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, urothelial (bladder) cancers and head and neck cancers, with each of these indications being addressed by at least two of the SPEAR T-cells.
 
Second, we are developing SPEAR T-cells directed to non-cancer testis antigens which are closely related to a specific disease indication. The first of these SPEAR T-cells is our AFP SPEAR T-cell which is directed to hepatocellular cancer. Further targets closely associated with other cancers are also being validated.
 
Finally, we are identifying peptides to different Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) types ensuring that for any given target, for example NY-ESO, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4 or AFP, we can address patient populations with different HLA types.
 
We have Phase 1/2 clinical trials ongoing with our NY-ESO and MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cells and during 2016 opened two additional INDs for our AFP and MAGE A-4 SPEAR T-cells. Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell has shown promising initial results in clinical trials with a 50% response rate and 18-month median survival rate reported in synovial sarcoma (a solid tumor) and a 91%  response rate at day 100 post autologous stem cell transplant in multiple myeloma. The NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell has shown a promising tolerability profile to date in all clinical trials.  Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and has also received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also granted PRIME regulatory access for the Companys NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy for the synovial sarcoma indication. We expect further clinical data during 2017.
 
In addition, we continue to use our SPEAR T-cell platform to identify further target peptides which provide additional coverage for any existing indications or which show high expression in specific cancers. We have identified over 30 intracellular target peptides and have 12 research programs evaluating these peptides.
 
We also recognize that further development of our SPEAR T-cells will assist in enhancing efficacy and durability of response. We therefore have a number of next generation SPEAR T-cell strategies to further develop and engineer our SPEAR T-cells in addition to the initiation of combination therapy approaches, the first of which is with Merck & Co., Incs (Merck) KEYTRUDA®. To enable continued innovation and development, we also have collaborations with third parties intended to promote further next generation solutions. These include our collaboration with Universal Cells, Inc. (Universal Cells) and our collaboration with Bellicum Pharmaceutical Inc. (Bellicum). With Universal Cells, we are looking to develop affinity engineered donor T cells that are universally applicable to all patients. While these universal cells would be specific for a given HLA type and target antigen, they would overcome the current limitation of autologous therapies that need to be manufactured specifically for each patient. The enhanced T-cell technology being developed involves selective engineering of cell surface proteins, without the use of nucleases, to develop universal T-cell products. If successful, this will enable us to treat large patient populations with an off-the-shelf product. Our Bellicum collaboration was announced in December 2016 and under the collaboration, we will evaluate Bellicums GoTCR technology (inducible MyD88/CD40 co-stimulation, or iMC) with our SPEAR T-cells for the potential to create enhanced T-cell therapeutics.

Our Clinical Product Pipeline
 
NY-ESO
 
Our SPEAR T-cell therapy targets the NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1a cancer antigens which are present in multiple different tumor types. We are conducting Phase 1/2 clinical trials in patients with solid tumours and haematological malignancies including synovial sarcoma, multiple myeloma, NSCLC and ovarian cancer. A pilot trial in myxoid round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) started in December 2016. We are planning to start a pivotal trial in synovial sarcoma, which is dependent on the start and performance of comparability studies. Clinical trials are ongoing in the United States and clinical trial applications have been approved in both Canada and the United Kingdom.
 
MAGE-A10
 
Our second SPEAR T-cell therapy, targeting the MAGE-A10 peptide, is currently in clinical trials in the United States. The MAGE-A10 trial in NSCLC was initiated in late 2015. A three tumor trial in urothelial (bladder) cancers, melanoma and head and neck cancers was initiated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) in October 2016 and the trial is currently being initiated at other sites in the United States and Canada. Initial data for our MAGE-A10 clinical trials is anticipated in late 2017 or early 2018.
 
AFP SPEAR T-cell
 
An IND for our AFP SPEAR T-cell for the treatment of hepatocellular cancer was opened in 2016. Clinical trial sites in the United States and Europe will be initiated in 2017. Initial data from the AFP clinical trials is anticipated in late 2017 or early 2018.
 
MAGE-A4 SPEAR T-cell
 
An IND for our MAGE-A4 SPEAR T-cell program in urothelial (bladder) cancers, melanoma, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, NSCLC, esophageal cancer and gastric cancers is now open. Initial data on our MAGE-A4 SPEAR T-cell program is anticipated in late 2017 or early 2018.
 
The following table summarizes the status of our current clinical trials:

Business Strategy
 
Our strategic objective is to be a world leader in discovering, developing and commercializing TCR-based T-cell therapies that transform the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer. In order to achieve our objective, we are focused on the following strategies:
 
Advance our clinical studies for our AFP, MAGE-A10 and MAGE-A4 SPEAR T-cells and advance clinical studies with our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell beyond the setting of synovial sarcoma where preliminary evidence of efficacy and safety is established. We have four SPEAR T-cells with open INDs covering multiple indications and we plan to advance all four SPEAR T-cells further during 2017 with the aim of providing initial tolerability data for SPEAR T-cells other than our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell. We are also advancing clinical studies for our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell in indications other than synovial sarcoma, and clinical trials are already being extended to additional sites within the United States and within Europe. We are also planning to advance into pivotal trials in synovial sarcoma with our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell. Discussions with the FDA in relation to the planning of that pivotal trial are ongoing.
 
Continue to use our SPEAR T-cell platform to generate SPEAR T-cells for cancers where existing therapeutic approaches are limited. We intend to continue to generate TCR therapeutic candidates from our fully integrated technology platform, which enables the systematic identification and validation of suitable target peptides, T-cell cloning, engineering of TCRs and preclinical testing processes. The first of our two approaches uses cancer testis antigens and aims to select multiple cancer testis antigens for any given indication to maximize the patient coverage that can be obtained with our SPEAR T-cell products. The second approach relies on the identification of targets which are closely associated with a particular cancer and where the SPEAR T-cells can then be specifically targeted to that cancer.
 
Continue to understand, further enhance and improve effectiveness and persistence of our SPEAR T-cell therapies.  We continue to evaluate and work to understand the mechanism of action of our SPEAR T-cells, in particular the best approaches for enhancing effectiveness and persistence of our SPEAR T-cells. We continue to further develop our TCR therapeutic candidates by exploring the addition of other components in our lentiviral vector, which would be expressed in the SPEAR T-cells alongside the engineered TCR. In addition, we are planning to evaluate the combination of our SPEAR T-cell therapies with other immunotherapy approaches. A combination trial with Mercks KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with multiple myeloma is planned to start in 2017.
 
Optimize and expand our process development and manufacturing capabilities to maintain our leadership position in the TCR space. Our commercial-ready cell manufacturing process (cell process 1.5), has been reviewed by the FDA and the FDA has allowed us to proceed with implementation of cell process 1.5 into our ongoing NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell trials. We continue to optimize the manufacture, supply, associated analytical expertise and quality systems for our SPEAR T-cell therapies to ensure that our manufacturing capability is sufficient for later-stage clinical trials and, potentially, initial commercial supply. We continue to work with third party contract manufacturers in both the United States and Europe to plan for commercial manufacture of our SPEAR T-cells. In addition, during 2016 we completed the shell and core construction for a new state of the art current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) manufacturing and office facility and continue to fit-out the facility, which is intended to support the clinical development and initial commercialization of SPEAR T-cells. We are planning to have manufacturing capability towards the end of 2017 and will initially manufacture SPEAR T-cells to support our clinical trials.
 
Expand our intellectual property portfolio. We intend to continue building on our technology platform, comprising intellectual property, proprietary methods and know-how in the field of TCRs and T-cells. These assets form the foundation for our ability not only to strengthen our product pipeline, but also to defend and expand our position as a leader in the field of T-cell therapies.
 
Our SPEAR T-cell Therapies
 
The Immune System and T-cells
 
The immune system plays an important role in targeting and destroying cancer cells. Specifically, T-cells, which are a type of white blood cell, and their receptors create a natural system that is designed to scan the body for diseased cells. In general, cells process proteins internally and then convert these proteins into peptide fragments which are then presented on the cell surface by a protein complex called the Human Leukocyte Antigen, or HLA. T-cells naturally scan all other cells in the body for the presence of abnormal peptide fragments, such as those generated from infectious agents. Recognition of this peptide-HLA complex takes place through the TCR expressed on the T-cells. Binding of naturally occurring TCRs to cancer targets, however, tends to be very poor because cancer proteins appear very similar to naturally occurring proteins on healthy cells and TCRs that recognise what the body sees as self-proteins are eliminated during early human development. Even when TCRs recognize cancer cells expressing novel proteins caused by mutations, elements of the immune system, or the cancer itself often suppress the T-cell response.

Target Identification and Validation
 
Before developing any engineered T-cell or TCR it is important to identify and validate a suitable target cancer peptide. The target must be expressed primarily only on the cancer cells of interest and with expression in normal non-cancerous tissue only where a risk to the patient would be deemed acceptable. Careful validation and identification of targets is important to ensuring that any engineered TCR is specific to the targeted cancer and does not bind to the same target on non-cancer cells, or that the TCR does not recognize a similar peptide derived from a protein in normal cells. Our target identification platform is focused on three approaches. First, we are using our platform to validate cancer testis antigens. These targets have very low expression on most normal tissues in adults and are therefore preferred targets for our SPEAR T-cells. However, within a given indication, the frequency of expression of these targets may be low, and may not be uniformly expressed in every cell within a tumor. As a result, we are developing multiple SPEAR T-cells to different target peptides in selected disease indications to increase the probability of treating patients with a given disease indication and potentially the ability for re-treatment of patients with a different SPEAR T-cell. We have three SPEAR T-cells in clinical trials which are directed to cancer testis antigens, NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A4 and MAGE-A10. The targets to which these SPEAR T-cells are directed are expressed in multiple disease indications including NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial (bladder) cancers and head and neck cancers, with each of these indications being addressed by at least two of the SPEAR T-cells.
 
The second type of approach is directed to non-cancer testis antigens which are closely related to a specific disease indication. The first of these SPEAR T-cells is our AFP SPEAR T-cell which is directed to hepatocellular cancer. Further targets closely associated with other cancers are also in development.
 
Finally, we are identifying targets to different HLA types ensuring that for any given target, we can address patient populations with different HLA types.
 
Affinity Engineering
 
Following identification of a suitable target peptide, we identify TCRs that are capable of binding to that target peptide. We then engineer those identified TCRs to enhance and optimize their ability to target and bind to the cancer peptides, thereby enabling a highly targeted immunotherapy. The optimized TCR then undergoes extensive preclinical safety testing prior to administration to patients. Our SPEAR T-cell platform technology enables us to develop a pipeline of targets and TCR therapeutic candidates that we believe may be effective in a variety of cancer types that are unresponsive to currently available and experimental therapies. We have two SPEAR T-cells already in clinical trials (NY-ESO, MAGE-A10), two additional programs with open INDs are planned to enter the clinic in 2017 (AFP and MAGE-A4) and a pipeline of SPEAR T-cells in development.
Administration to Patients
 
The process for treating a patient with an engineered TCR therapeutic candidate involves extracting the patients T-cells and then combining the extracted cells with our delivery system containing the gene for our affinity-enhanced TCR, through a process known as transduction. Our delivery system uses a type of self-inactivating (SIN) virus, known as SIN-lentivirus, to transduce the patients T-cells and is referred to as a lentiviral vector. The transduced T-cells are then expanded and infused into the patient. When these T-cells encounter a recognized HLA-peptide complex, they multiply and initiate the destruction of the targeted cancer cells. The following diagram summarizes the process for manufacturing and administering our SPEAR T-cells.

Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy
 
Our first SPEAR T-cell targets the NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1a target peptides and is currently in clinical trials in the United States. Phase 1/2 studies are ongoing in synovial sarcoma, MRCLS, NSCLC and ovarian cancer indications. GSK has an exclusive option over our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program. For further details please see Core Alliances and Collaborations - GSK Collaboration and License Agreement below.
 
Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. The EMA has also granted PRIME regulatory access for the Companys NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy for the synovial sarcoma indication, and this product has breakthrough designation in the United States. NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells overall continue to demonstrate a generally acceptable benefit:risk profile to date.
 
As of January 5, 2017, 61 subjects have received NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells in our sponsored studies. The most common (>15%) adverse events in these subjects considered by investigators to be at least possibly related to our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells include: fever, diarrhea, fatigue, rash, nausea, anemia, dyspnea, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), lymphopenia, leukopenia, cough, ALT increased, AST increased, hypotension, sinus tachycardia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse events with a severity of grade 3 or higher and considered by investigators to be at least possibly related and occurring in more than one patient include: lymphopenia, leukopenia, anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, CRS, thrombocytopenia, hypophosphatemia, fever, rash,  dyspnea, hypotension, hypoxia, colitis, decreased appetite, dehydration, graft versus host disease, hyponatremia, and musculoskeletal chest pain. There has been one fatal (grade 5) bone marrow failure which was considered related to study treatment by the investigator in the trial. Internal investigations have not identified a mechanism by which the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells may have caused bone marrow failure. For further details on adverse events please see Part II  Item 1A Risk Factors  Our SPEAR T-cells may have undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their clinical development, prevent regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or otherwise result in significant negative consequences.
 
·                  Our synovial sarcoma program:
 
Soft tissue sarcomas can develop from tissues like fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues. There are approximately 50 types of soft tissue sarcomas, including synovial sarcoma, which is a malignant tumor of the soft tissues arising often around joints. Synovial sarcoma is associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation, and represents about nine percent of all soft tissue sarcomas. This disease is more common in children and young adults, and typically presents at an age ranging from 15 to 40 years. The majority of patients who develop metastatic soft tissue sarcomas are currently incurable, with 75% to 80% of patients not surviving past two to three years. First line therapy typically involves radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as surgical resection where possible. There are limited additional treatment options for unresectable, recurrent and metastatic synovial sarcoma, which is nearly always fatal, and systemic therapy is mainly used to provide palliation and slow disease progression.
 
There are four cohorts in the Phase 1/2 pilot study:
 
·                  Cohort 1 (patients with high NY-ESO-1 antigen expression and lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and
 
5




fludarabine)  enrollment in this first cohort is now complete.
 ·                  Cohort 2 (patients with low NY-ESO-1 antigen expression and lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine)  enrollment continues in this cohort. Indications of a clinical response have also been observed in cohort 2 for one patient out of the 4 evaluable patients treated to date.
 ·                  Cohort 3 (patients with high NY-ESO-1 antigen expression and lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide alone)  only one confirmed response was observed in evaluable patients treated in cohort 3 and as a result, this cohort has now closed. The data from this cohort 3 suggest that fludarabine may be required as part of the pre-conditioning regimen.
 ·                  Cohort 4 (patients with high NY-ESO-1 antigen expression and lymphodepletion with a modified (lower) dose of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine)  given the lack of response seen in cohort 3, cohort 4 is open and enrolling patients.
 
The current synovial sarcoma trials are also being extended to sites outside of the United States with clinical trial applications approved in both the United Kingdom and Canada.
 
NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells continue to demonstrate a generally acceptable benefit:risk profile to date in synovial sarcoma trials. As of September 30, 2016, our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells demonstrated a 50% (6/12) response rate in cohort 1 or 60% (6/10) response rate in patients receiving the target cell dose. The median survival rate for patients in cohort 1 is approximately 18 months (80 weeks) as of September 30, 2016.
 
The diagram below illustrates the best response rate for patients in cohort 1 as of September 30, 2016. Response rate has been determined using Response Evaluating Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. The dotted line denotes the level of decrease in target lesion required for a partial response.
 


As of January 5, 2017, 24 subjects have received NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells in our synovial sarcoma program. The most common (>30%) adverse events in this trial (all cohorts) considered by investigators to be at least possibly related to our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells include fever, anemia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, CRS, fatigue, nausea, dyspnea, rash, sinus tachycardia, cough, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse events with severity grade 3 or higher considered by investigators to be at least possibly related and occurring in more than one patient include lymphopenia, leukopenia, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, CRS, hypophosphatemia, fever, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, hypotension, hypoxia, musculoskeletal chest pain, and rash. One patient experienced a fatal bone marrow failure which was considered related to study treatment by the investigator in the trial. Internal investigations have not identified a mechanism by which the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells may have caused bone marrow failure.
 
We are in discussions with the FDA in relation to the initiation of a pivotal trial in the synovial sarcoma indication, including discussions relating to trial design and the requirement for comparability testing for use of our manufacturing process. The start of the pivotal trial is dependent on the start and performance of analytical comparability studies between the current and the commercial processes. Should comparability studies be delayed or the results not be acceptable to us or the FDA then the start of the pivotal trial will be delayed.

·                  Our MRCLS program:
 
Soft tissue sarcomas can develop from tissues like fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues. There are more than 50 types of soft tissue sarcomas, including MRCLS, which is mostly located in the limbs (most frequently in the thighs). MRCLS is associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation, and represents about 30 to 35 percent of liposarcomas and 5 to 10 percent of all adult soft tissue sarcomas. MRCLS commonly presents at an age ranging from 35 to 55 years.
 
A pilot trial in MRCLS is now active at sites in the United States. Initial data from this trial is expected in late 2017 or early 2018 depending on patient recruitment.
 
This is an open-label pilot study in patients to assess preliminary safety and efficacy in this new indication. Initially, 10 patients will be enrolled. If further characterization of the treatment is required, up to five additional patients may be enrolled. Eligible patients will be HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:05 and/or HLA-A*02:06 with advanced (metastatic or inoperable) MRCLS whose tumor express NY-ESO-1 (defined as >30% of tumor cells that are 2+ or 3+ by immunohistochemistry). Patients will receive preconditioning with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide at the same dose that is being used in cohort 4 of our ongoing synovial sarcoma Phase 1/2 study.
 
·                  Our Ovarian program:
 
Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. About 85 to 90 percent of ovarian cancers are cancerous epithelial tumors or epithelial ovarian carcinomas. It is estimated that approximately 22,440 women will receive a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and approximately 14,080 women will die of this disease in the United States in 2017. This cancer mainly develops in older women, and approximately half of all ovarian cancers occur in women 63 years of age or older.
 
The primary trial objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of our NY-ESO TCR therapeutic candidate with chemotherapy preconditioning in patients who have refractory or resistant Stage 3/4 ovarian cancer.
 
To date, no objective clinical responses have been reported in patients. The initial patients received a preconditioning regimen which consisted of cyclophosphamide alone. The protocol for the ovarian study has now been amended to include a preconditioning regimen which includes both fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Further data from this trial with the modified preconditioning regimen is expected in late 2017 or early 2018 depending on the rate of patient recruitment.
 
·                  Our Melanoma program:
 
No objective responses have been observed in the four patients treated to date in this trial. As a result, no further patients will be enrolled in the trial. A combination study with immune check point inhibitors (CPI) was previously being considered but is no longer being considered given the changes in the underlying standard of care for melanoma patients and the likely difficulty in recruiting patients to such a combination study.
·                  Our Myeloma program:
 
Multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignancies of plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system. It is estimated that approximately 30,280 new cases of multiple myeloma will be diagnosed in the United States in 2017 (17,490 in men and 12,790 in women). Multiple myeloma is characterized by several features, including low blood counts, bone and calcium problems, infections, kidney problems, monoclonal gammopathy, and by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells within bone marrow. The risk of multiple myeloma goes up as people age, and less than one percent of cases are diagnosed in people younger than 35. Most people diagnosed with this cancer are at least 65 years of age.
 
Enrollment in the myeloma trial (with autologous stem-cell transplantation, or ASCT) was completed in July 2014. The Phase 1/2, open-label, two-site clinical trial in 25 multiple myeloma patients who were eligible for ASCT was open to patients with high risk or relapsed multiple myeloma, who have few remaining treatment options and short life expectancy. Prior to enrollment in the clinical trial, patients had received on average three prior therapies and the trial included six patients that had a prior ASCT. Sixty percent of tumors contained cytogenetic abnormalities that represent negative prognostic indicators. Disease response was assessed in accordance with the International Uniform Response Criteria for myeloma assessment and the additional criteria of nCR which was consistent with the methods employed by the Bone Marrow Transplantation Clinical Trials.
 
Interim results from this Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple myeloma patients were reported in Nature Medicine, published on July 20, 2015. Nature Medicine reported response rates in patients with active disease at the time of transplant, with a 59%
 
7




CR/nCR as compared to 24-38% CR/nCR rates at 100 days in other studies treating myeloma with stem cell transplants alone and with stem cell transplants with bortezomib, respectively.
 
A 91% response rate at day 100 has been previously reported for patients and as of January 27, 2017 there is a median survival rate of approximately three years. Survival data is illustrated in the following Kaplan Meier plot.
 

As of January 5, 2017, 25 subjects have received NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells in our myeloma transplant program. The most common (>30%) adverse events in this trial considered by investigators to be at least possibly related to our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells include diarrhea and rash. Adverse events with severity grade 3 or higher considered by investigators to be at least possibly related and occurring in more than one patient include diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, colitis, graft versus host disease, neutropenia and rash.
 
On October 27, 2016, we announced entry into a clinical trial collaboration agreement for the assessment of our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell in combination with Mercks anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with multiple myeloma. The study will evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the combination, and is planned for initiation during the second half of 2017. 
 
·                 NSCLC: A trial in NSCLC opened in 2016. Enrollment has been more challenging than anticipated. Initial data is currently anticipated in late 2017, but availability of data for publication will depend on the number of patients recruited to the trial. The chemotherapy preconditioning regimen has been modified in a protocol amendment to include both fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and the NY-ESO expression requirement has been modified to at least 1+ in >10% of the cells.
 
Our NY-ESO T-cell therapeutic has also been used in an investigator-initiated clinical program funded by the European Union, the Adoptive Engineered T-cell Targeting to Activate Cancer Killing (ATTACK 2) program. The therapy, which is produced under a different manufacturing process than Adaptimmunes NY-ESO TCR therapy, is being evaluated for the treatment of patients with advanced gastro-esophageal cancer for the first time. Two patients have been treated under this protocol, one of whom passed away 46 days after initial treatment. Enrollment in the trial was temporarily paused pending investigation of the patient fatality, but an independent data monitoring committee has recommended that recruitment can resume following a protocol amendment. The European Union has since terminated funding of the trial due to the delays in trial progression and we are in discussions with the sponsor, the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, in relation to continuation of the trial.

Our MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cell Therapy
 
MAGE-A10 is a target peptide expressed in a number of solid tumor cell types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial, melanoma and head and neck cancers. Clinical trials are ongoing in the United States in all these tumor types.
 
·             NSCLC: Approximately 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers are NSCLC, and smoking is by far the leading risk factor. About 40 percent of all NSCLCs are adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common in the United States and Europe being 25 to 30 percent of NSCLC. Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, and it is estimated that one out of four cancer deaths are from lung cancer. Lung cancer mainly occurs in older people, and approximately two out of three people diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older, while less than two percent are younger than 45.
 
The initial clinical program in NSCLC is an open label Phase 1 dose escalating study in patients with advanced stage NSCLC expressing the MAGE-A10 antigen. The primary objectives of the study are to assess safety and tolerability of our MAGE-A10 TCR therapeutic candidate in patients. Secondary objectives include the assessment of efficacy and durability of persistence. Enrollment of patients into this program has been challenging. Initial data is expected in late 2017 or early 2018 depending on patient enrollment.
 
·             3-tumor trial - A three tumor trial in urothelial, melanoma and head and neck cancers received RAC (the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee) approval in May 2016. The first trial site, MD Anderson, is now initiated and the trial is currently being initiated at other sites in the United States and Canada. This is a Phase I, open-label, modified 3+3 dose escalation study of autologous T-cells genetically engineered with an affinity optimized MAGE-A10 T-cell receptor in HLAA*0201 and HLA-A*0206 positive patients with inoperable or metastatic urothelial cancer (transitional cell cancer of the bladder, ureter or renal pelvis), melanoma, or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck expressing the MAGE-A10 antigen.
 
·                  Urothelial: Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer. These cancers mainly start in the urothelial cells that line the inside of the bladder or other parts of the urinary tract. Bladder cancer accounts for approximately five percent of all new cancers in the United States, and is the fourth most common cancer in men. Men are about three to four times more likely to get bladder cancer than women. It is estimated that 79,030 new cases of bladder cancer will be diagnosed (about 60,490 in men and 18,540 in women), and about 16,870 deaths from bladder cancer will occur (about 12,240 in men and 4,630 in women) in the United States in 2017. Bladder cancer occurs mainly in older people, and approximately 9 out of 10 people with this cancer are over the age of 55.
 ·                  Melanoma: Melanoma is a cancer that begins in specific skin cells called melanocytes, and exposure to ultraviolet rays is a major risk factor for most melanomas. It is estimated that approximately 87,110 new melanomas will be diagnosed (about 52,170 in men and 34,940 in women), and about 9,730 people are expected to die of melanoma (about 6,380 men and 3,350 women) in the United States in 2017. The risk of melanoma increases as people age, and the average age at diagnosis is 63 years. However, melanoma is not uncommon among those younger than 30, and it is one of the most common cancers in young adults (especially young women).
 ·                  Head and Neck: Cancers of the head and neck, which include cancers of the oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, salivary glands, and nose/nasal passages, account for approximately three percent of all malignancies in the United States. At least 75 percent of head and neck cancers are caused by tobacco and alcohol use. Infection with cancer-causing types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is also a risk factor for some types of head and neck cancers. In recent years, there has been a drop in the incidence of head and neck cancers caused by tobacco and alcohol, and a rise in the incidence of head and neck cancers caused by HPV.
 
Our AFP SPEAR T-cell Therapy
 
AFP is a target peptide associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer in adults. Many patients who develop liver cancer have long-standing cirrhosis (scar tissue formation from liver cell damage), and early detection can be difficult because signs and symptoms often do not appear until later stages. It is estimated that approximately 40,710 new cases of liver cancer will be diagnosed (about 29,200 in men and 11,510 in women) and about 28,920 people will die from this disease (about 19,610 men and 9,310 women) in the United States in 2017.
 
An IND for a clinical trial of our AFP SPEAR T-cell in hepatocellular cancer was opened in 2016 and we anticipate site initiation in the first half of 2017. Enrollment is dependent on the availability of the vector used to manufacture our AFP SPEAR T-cell. The Phase 1 clinical trial will include a dose escalation and expansion of a tolerable dose to explore initial evidence of anti-tumor activity. The trial will also include evaluation of two pre-treatment regimens, one with fludarabine and one without fludarabine.

Our MAGE-A4 SPEAR T-cell Therapy
 
The FDA has accepted the Companys IND application for autologous genetically modified T-cells expressing an affinity optimized TCR specific for MAGE-A4 in patients with multiple malignant solid tumors. The IND is now active and we are actively working with sites in the United States to get the study started as soon as possible in 2017.
 
Under this IND, Adaptimmune will initiate a Phase 1, open-label, modified 3+3 dose escalation study of autologous T-cells genetically engineered with an affinity optimized MAGE-A4 TCR in HLA*02 positive patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, and urothelial, head and neck, ovarian, non-small cell lung, esophageal, and gastric cancers expressing the MAGE-A4 target peptides. Patients will receive preconditioning with modified fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as used in the Companys ongoing synovial sarcoma study. This multi-tumor study will enroll up to 32 patients. The trial will also include dose escalation in initial patients.
 
Initial data is anticipated in late 2017 or early 2018.
 
Next Generation Technology Platform Development
 
Next Generation Therapeutics
 
We believe that there is also further room to enhance the potency and durability of our SPEAR T-cells, for instance by adding further active proteins into the lentiviral delivery system. These enhancements are designed to result in generation 2 SPEAR T-cells for future clinical programs. We have multiple development programs ongoing which are researching different modifications to our SPEAR T-cells. For example, we have an active development program for a dnTGFBRII SPEAR T-cell. This next generation SPEAR T-cell is designed to block immune suppression by TGFB in certain tumor microenvironments, thereby enhancing the activity and duration of response seen with our SPEAR T-cells within those environments. We are also considering CD8 constructs where the aim is to promote the antigen spread, anti-tumor memory and tumor inflammation seen with our SPEAR T-cells. We are currently in the process of planning INDs for at least one next generation SPEAR T-cell for 2018.
Manufacturing Improvements
 
In parallel with our ongoing clinical programs and underlying target peptide identification work, we are improving the processes for manufacture of our lentiviral vector and SPEAR T-cells. Our goal is to achieve a more consistent and efficient manufacturing process and ultimately to reduce the cost of supply.
 
We have made a number of changes to our current SPEAR T-cell manufacturing process. In particular, we are now streamlining some of the manual steps in the process by simplifying the initial T-cell selection through increased use of the antibody-bound magnetic Dynabeads® CD3/CD28. We are also introducing cryopreservation steps which make the logistics of administering our SPEAR T-cells more flexible for patients and will also facilitate treatment of patients outside the United States. Expansion and harvest of the SPEAR T-cells is now serum-free after initial culture preparation and is being further optimized. A data package for this amended process (cell process 1.5) was submitted to the FDA during 2016 and the FDA has allowed us to proceed with implementation of this cell process 1.5 into our ongoing NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell trials. Finally, we are also working towards automation of at least certain parts of the manufacturing process.
 
For the vector supply, we are developing and evaluating alternative approaches to increase volume and continuity of supply while at the same time decreasing the cost of the vector supply.
 
Additionally, in connection with our SPEAR T-cells, we are also working with third-party contractors to develop companion diagnostics for screening of patient tumors for the presence of target peptides.
 
Core Alliances and Collaborations
 
GSK Collaboration and License Agreement
 
We entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with GSK in May 2014 (the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement) regarding the development, manufacture and commercialization of TCR therapeutic candidates. The collaboration is for up to five programs, the first being the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program.
 
Under the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement, the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program and associated manufacturing optimization work will be conducted by us in collaboration with GSK. GSK has an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to the NY-ESO therapeutic candidate program, exercisable during the performance of the program and up to specified time periods after we have delivered a Phase 1/2 data package for the program to GSK. If the option is exercised after delivery of the Phase 1/2 data package, GSK will assume full responsibility for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program. In February 2016, the GSK Collaboration and
 
10




License Agreement was expanded to accelerate the development of the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells towards pivotal trials in synovial sarcoma, as well as the exploration of development of NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells in MRCLS. The amendment also provides the opportunity for up to eight combination studies using NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells. As the program progresses, additional amendments to the scope and timing of the NY-ESO development plan may be agreed with GSK.
 
A second target, PRAME, has also now been nominated by GSK under the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement. As a result of the nomination, Adaptimmune will be responsible for taking the PRAME SPEAR T-cell program through preclinical testing and up to IND filing. GSK is responsible for the IND filing itself. GSK has an exclusive option over the program. Under the terms of the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement, the potential development milestones eligible related to the PRAME program could amount to approximately $300 million, if GSK exercises its option and successfully develops this target in more than one indication and more than one HLA type. Adaptimmune would also receive tiered sales milestones and mid-single to low double-digit royalties on worldwide net sales.
 
Three other targets may be nominated by GSK at specified times under the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement, excluding any research programs already in progress. Upon nomination by GSK of any of these three additional targets, we will grant to GSK an exclusive option on each target, which can be exercised up to four months after approval of an IND in relation to a TCR therapeutic candidate directed against the nominated target. Nomination also triggers the start of a collaboration program to develop the relevant TCR therapeutic candidate directed to the nominated target peptide.
 
Following exercise of any option (including the options for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell and PRAME SPEAR T-cell programs), we will grant to GSK an exclusive worldwide license under intellectual property rights specific to the SPEAR T-cell developed under the relevant collaboration programs. GSK will, at its own expense, be fully responsible for all further development and commercialization of the relevant T-cell candidates. Under the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program, in the event of early exercise of the option, we will, unless otherwise agreed with GSK, have a continuing obligation to complete any work outstanding under the agreed development plan for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program. The licenses do not include a right for GSK to develop alternative affinity-enhanced TCRs using our intellectual property rights or to develop other TCR therapeutic candidates directed to different target peptides. Under the agreement, we are also prohibited from independently developing or commercializing T-cell therapeutics directed at the targets subject to outstanding options granted to GSK.
 
Under the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $42.1 million in June 2014 and are entitled to various milestone payments based on the achievement of specified development and commercialization milestones. As of December 31, 2016, we had achieved development milestones of $39.0 million.
 
In addition to the development milestones, we are entitled to royalties from GSK on all GSK sales of T-cell products licensed under the agreement, varying between a mid-single-digit percentage and a low-double-digit percentage of net sales, subject to certain agreed reductions, dependent on the cumulative annual net sales for each calendar year. Royalties are payable while there is a jointly owned or solely owned valid patent claim covering the TCR therapeutic in the country in which the relevant TCR therapeutic is being sold and, in each case, for a minimum of 10 years from first commercial sale of the relevant TCR therapeutic. Sales milestones also apply once any TCR therapeutic covered by the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement is on the market.
 
The GSK Collaboration and License Agreement is effective until all payment obligations expire, including any ongoing royalty payments due in relation to GSKs sale of any covered TCR therapeutic candidates. The agreement can also be terminated on a collaboration program-by-collaboration program basis by GSK for lack of feasibility or inability to meet certain agreed requirements. Both parties have rights to terminate the agreement for material breach upon 60 days written notice or immediately upon insolvency of the other party. GSK has additional rights to terminate either the agreement or any specific license or collaboration program upon 60 days written notice to us. Additional payments may be due to us as a result of such termination, and where we continue any development of any TCR therapeutic candidate resulting from a terminated collaboration program, depending on the stage of development, royalties may be payable to GSK at a mid-single-digit percentage rate of net sales. We also have rights to terminate any license where GSK ceases development or withdraws any licensed TCR therapeutic in specified circumstances.
 
Details of the relationship are also set out in Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Reliance Upon Third Parties  We rely heavily on GSK for our NY-ESO TCR therapeutic candidate clinical program, which may also affect other SPEAR T-cell programs.
 
MD Anderson Strategic Alliance
 
On September 26, 2016, we announced that we had entered into a multi-year strategic alliance with MD Anderson designed to expedite the development of T-cell therapies for multiple types of cancer.  The Company and MD Anderson will collaborate in a number of studies including clinical and preclinical development of Adaptimmunes SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting NY-ESO, MAGE-A10 and future clinical stage first and second generation SPEAR T-cell therapies such as MAGE-A4 across a number of cancers, including bladder, lung, ovarian, head and neck, melanoma, sarcoma, esophageal and gastric cancers. The Company will make payments to MD Anderson as certain milestones are achieved and these costs will be expensed to research and development as MD Anderson renders the services.
 
Under the terms of the alliance agreement, Adaptimmune will sponsor a number of clinical and preclinical studies. Adaptimmune has committed funding of at least US $19,644,000 to fund studies under the alliance agreement. Payment of this funding is contingent on mutual agreement to study orders, in order for any study to be included under the alliance, and the performance of set milestones by MD Anderson.
 
11




The alliance and the performance of the various studies will be overseen by a joint steering committee. Decisions of the joint steering committee require unanimity, with one vote being given to each party to the agreement. MD Anderson will supply the required personnel, facilities and equipment for performance of the agreed studies and Adaptimmune will, where applicable, supply the SPEAR T-cell therapy for patient administration.
 
We will own all results and data arising from the performance of the alliance studies, save for original source documents and patient records. MD Anderson retains the right to use such results and data for its internal research, academic, and patient care purposes. Certain intellectual property rights arising under the alliance will be owned by the Company, with others being owned by the party or parties creating such intellectual property rights. MD Anderson grants to the Company a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable royalty-free license to any arising intellectual property rights in which MD Anderson has an ownership interest, for any purpose.  Such license includes an unrestricted right to sublicense through multiple tiers. MD Anderson also grants the Company an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive (subject to MD Andersons perpetual, irrevocable, no-cost right to use such invention for non-commercial internal research, academic and patient care purposes), royalty-bearing license to any arising intellectual property rights in which MD Anderson has an ownership interest. In turn, the Company grants to MD Anderson a limited, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any arising intellectual property rights in which it has an ownership interest for internal non-commercial research, academic and patient care purposes.
 
The alliance agreement may be terminated by either party for material breach by the other party. Individual studies may be terminated inter alia for material breach, health and safety concerns or where the institutional review board (IRB), the review board at the clinical site with oversight of the clinical study,  requests termination of any study. Where any legal or regulatory authorization is finally withdrawn or terminated, the relevant study will also terminate automatically.
 
Merck Combination Agreement
 
On October 27, 2016, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), for the assessment of our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy in combination with Mercks PD-1 inhibitor, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with multiple myeloma. The study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the combination, and is planned for initiation in the first half of 2017.
 
Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has previously been evaluated in multiple myeloma in a single agent Phase 1/2 trial in which 20 out of 22 patients (91%) experienced a response at day 100 post autologous stem cell transplant. KEYTRUDA® is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the bodys immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells.  KEYTRUDA® blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Blocking this interaction is reported to enable T-cell activation and potentiates antitumor activity.
 
We believe there is preclinical evidence to support the view that the combination of NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy and anti-PD-1 therapy may lead to meaningful anti-tumor activity. We are planning to evaluate our therapy alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA® in a randomized trial of patients with multiple myeloma who are refractory or have relapsed with standard therapy.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, each of Merck and the Company will manufacture and supply its relevant compound for use in the combination study. Adaptimmune will act as the sponsor for the combination study. Each party will be responsible for its own internal costs associated with the agreement and Adaptimmune will be responsible for the other costs of the combination study. Coordination of the activities under the agreement is via a joint development committee, which comprises an equal number of members from each party. Intellectual property rights under the agreement will, depending on the nature of such rights, be owned solely by either party or jointly. The agreement will last until the earlier of delivery of the final study report or study completion. Either party may terminate the agreement for material breach, patient safety, regulatory action preventing supply of compound or withdrawal of regulatory approval for one of the combination study compounds. Merck may also terminate the agreement where it believes its compound is being used in an unsafe manner.
 
Universal Cells Research, Collaboration and License Agreement
 
On November 25, 2015, we entered into a Research, Collaboration and License Agreement relating to gene editing and HLA-engineering technology with Universal Cells. The Company paid an upfront license and start-up fee of $2.5 million to Universal Cells in November 2015 and a milestone payment of $3.0 million in February 2016.  Further milestone payments of up to $44 million are payable if certain development and product milestones are achieved. Universal Cells would also receive a profit-share payment for the first product, and royalties on sales of other products utilizing its technology.  The upfront and start-up fee was expensed to research and development when incurred.
 
Under the agreement, the companies have mutually agreed to a development plan for the development of affinity-enhanced donor T-cells that are universally applicable. The enhanced T-cell technology being developed involves selective engineering of cell surface proteins, without the use of nucleases, to develop universal T-cell products. The development plan is split into a series of
 
12




phases which can be varied as the project progresses and dependent on the output of earlier phases. The development plan is overseen by a joint steering committee consisting of equal members from each party.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Universal Cells grants to Adaptimmune an exclusive, sub-licenseable, worldwide right and license in the field of T-cell immunotherapy, with the right to grant sublicences, under certain intellectual property rights of Universal Cells. The agreement also includes the sub-license of certain intellectual property rights owned by the University of Washington. Adaptimmune grants to Universal Cells a non-exclusive license under its intellectual property rights to the extent required for the performance of the development program.
 
The agreement will expire on the last to expire of any of the Universal Cells licensed intellectual property, unless terminated earlier for material breach or insolvency. Adaptimmune also has a right to terminate the agreement on provision of written notice where it has safety concerns, does not wish to proceed to the next phase of development or in the event of a change of control.
 
Bellicum Pharmaceuticals Inc, Co-Development and Co-Commercialization Agreement
 
On December 16, 2016, we entered into a Co-Development and Co-Commercialization Agreement with Bellicum in order to facilitate a staged collaboration to evaluate, develop and commercialize next generation T-cell therapies.
 
Under the agreement, we will evaluate Bellicums GoTCR technology (inducible MyD88/CD40 co-stimulation, or iMC) with our SPEAR T-cells for the potential to create enhanced T-cell therapeutics. Depending on results of the initial preclinical proof-of-concept phase, we may progress to a two-target co-development and co-commercialization phase. To the extent necessary, and in furtherance of the parties proof-of-concept and co-development efforts, the parties granted each other a royalty-free, non-transferable, non-exclusive license covering their respective technologies for purposes of facilitating such proofof-concept and co-development efforts. In addition, as to covered therapies developed under the agreement, the parties granted each other a reciprocal exclusive license for the commercialization of such therapies.
 
With respect to any joint commercialization of a covered therapy, the parties agreed to negotiate in good faith the commercially reasonable terms of a co-commercialization agreement. The parties also agreed that any such agreement shall provide for, among other things, equal sharing of the costs of any such joint commercialization and the calculation of profit shares as set forth in the agreement.
 
The agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis once the parties cease commercialization of the T-cell therapies covered by the agreement, unless earlier terminated by either party for material breach, non-performance or cessation of development, bankruptcy/insolvency, or failure to progress to co-development phase.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights for our SPEAR T-cells and processes, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other protection including data/market exclusivity for our SPEAR T-cells and SPEAR platform technology, preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property.
 
Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position generally by filing an initial priority filing at the U.K. Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) and the U.S. Patent Trademark Office (USPTO). This is followed by the filing of a patent application under the Patent Co-operation Treaty claiming priority from the initial application(s) and then application for patent grant in, for example, the United States, Europe (including major European territories), Japan, Australia, New Zealand, India and Canada. In each case, we determine the strategy and territories required after discussion with our patent professionals to ensure that we obtain relevant coverage in territories that are commercially important to us and our TCR therapeutic candidates. We will additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, including as relevant exclusivity through orphan or pediatric drug designation. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our underlying platform technology, manufacturing processes and SPEAR T-cells. Prior to making any decision on filing any patent application, we consider with our patent professionals whether patent protection is the most sensible strategy for protecting the invention concerned or whether the invention should be maintained as confidential.
 
As of December 31, 2016 we owned or jointly owned approximately 173 granted patents (of which 18 are U.S.-issued patents) and 69 pending patent applications (of which 7 are U.S. National patent applications). These patents and patent applications include claims directed to our SPEAR T-cells, our platform technology used to identify and generate engineered TCR therapeutic candidates and our manufacturing and process technology.

TCR libraries
 
We have filed 10 patent applications which cover large libraries of TCR genes which we have generated and the method of their generation: these act as proprietary sources for screening for TCRs which are the starting points for engineering into clinical candidates.
 
Manufacturing Process Patents and Patent Applications
 
We also have know-how and patent applications that we own which relate to the manufacture of our SPEAR T-cells. For example, we have filed patent applications in the major territories, which claim priority from initial priority patent applications filed at the USPTO and UKIPO, which are directed to a particular modification to the lentiviral vector technology. We believe this modification enhances the safety profile of the lentiviral vector technology.
Next Generation Approaches
 
We have recently filed a priority generating patent application in relation to a gene which prevents our cytotoxic T-cells from being inhibited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This is relevant to all of our products in solid tumor
 
14




indications and protects one of the next generation SPEAR T-cell products under development. Further next generation patent applications are expected to be filed shortly.
 
Exclusive License for Bead Products
 
In December 2012, we entered into two agreements, a license and a sub-license, with ThermoFisher Scientific Inc. (ThermoFisher). The license agreement grants us a field-based exclusive license under certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by ThermoFisher in relation to the methods of use of the ThermoFisher Scientific Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 technology to isolate, activate and expand T cells and enable transfection of the T cells with any TCR genes to manufacture our licensed products and use and sell those TCR products to treat cancer, infectious disease and/or autoimmune disease. The licensed field relates to the ex-vivo activation and expansion of human T cells containing engineered TCRs for use as a therapy for treating cancer, infectious disease and/or autoimmune disease and where the therapy comprises the steps of (a) removing a sample containing T cells from a patient; (b) isolating T cells from that sample using the ThermoFisher bead product or similar magnetic beads; (c) transfecting those isolated T cells with a gene or genes encoding engineered TCRs of known antigen specificity; (d) activating and expanding the population of those engineered T cells using the ThermoFisher bead product or similar magnetic beads; and (e) introducing the expanded, engineered T cells back into the same patient. The license is not sub-licensable, but we are able to sub-contract manufacture of the licensed products to our contract manufacturing organizations. Our sub-licensees have access to the required license directly from ThermoFisher under the above-described intellectual property rights on terms equivalent to those we have obtained from ThermoFisher in relation to our partnered licensed products.
 
We have granted an option under the license agreement to ThermoFisher to take an exclusive license under any improvements made by or for, or controlled by, us to the ThermoFisher patented technology to the extent any such improvements are dominated by the patent rights licensed to us. Any license will be outside of the exclusive field we have been granted, namely engineered T-cell therapy.
 
Under the license agreement, we have to demonstrate reasonable commercial efforts to carry out development and commercialization of the licensed products and we are required to make certain expenditures for research and development relating to the commercialization of the licensed products. This obligation is deemed satisfied upon first commercial sale of a licensed product. We have certain payment obligations under the license agreement including an upfront license fee of $335,000, which has already been paid, minimum annual royalty (in the low tens of thousands of U.S. dollars prior to licensed product approval and thereafter at a level of 50% of running royalties in the previous year), milestone payments (payable for each licensed product on achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones per licensed product) and a low single-digit running royalty payable on the net selling price of each licensed product. The license agreement will last until the expiration of the latest to expire of the licensed patent rights. The license agreement can be terminated before the end of its term by mutual agreement, by ThermoFisher on the occurrence of certain events (failure to use reasonable commercial efforts, willful making of a false statement of a material fact, breach of antitrust laws or other laws, material breach of the agreement, payment default or if we have challenged the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents). The license may also be terminated in the event of insolvency by either party.
 
We also have a field-based exclusive sub-license under certain other patents which cover the method of use of the Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 and are controlled by ThermoFisher under a head-license from the University of Michigan, the U.S. Navy and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The sub-license has the same relevant exclusivity scope and field-based restrictions and many of the terms are equivalent to those set out in the main license agreement with ThermoFisher, including the same requirement to demonstrate reasonable commercial efforts to carry out development and commercialization of the licensed products as in the main license agreement with ThermoFisher. We have certain payment obligations under the sub-license agreement including an upfront license fee of $665,000, which has already been paid, minimum annual royalty (in the tens of thousands of U.S. dollars prior to product approval and thereafter at a level of 50% of running royalties in the previous year), milestone payments (payable for each sub-licensed product on achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones per sub-licensed product) and a low single-digit running royalty payable on the net selling price of each sub-licensed product. The sub-license agreement will last until the expiration of the latest to expire of the sub-licensed patent rights. The sub-license agreement can be terminated before the end of its term by mutual agreement, by ThermoFisher or the head licensors on the occurrence of certain events (failure to use reasonable commercial efforts, willful making of a false statement of a material fact, failure to adequately meet any requirement for public use required under Federal regulations, breach of antitrust laws or other laws, material breach of the agreement, payment default or if we have challenged the validity or enforceability of any of the sub-licensed patents). The sub-license may also be terminated in the event of insolvency by either party. The sub-license has an additional requirement that any manufacture of engineered TCR products for sale in the United States must occur in the United States and reserves rights for the U.S. government to use the technology in accordance with 35 USC §200 et seq. and for the University of Michigan, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to use the technology for non-commercial research purposes. The aggregate milestone payments payable per product under the license and sub-license agreements do not exceed $5 million.
 
On June 16, 2016, the Company entered into a supply agreement with ThermoFisher for the supply of the Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 technology. The Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 technology is used in our manufacturing process to isolate, activate and expand patient T-cells.  The supply agreement runs until December 31, 2025. Under the supply agreement, the Company
 
15




is required to purchase its requirements for CD3/CD28 magnetic bead product exclusively from ThermoFisher for a period of 5 years and there are also minimum purchasing obligations. ThermoFisher has the right to terminate the supply agreement for material breach or insolvency.
 
See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Reliance Upon Third PartiesWe rely heavily on ThermoFisher and the technology we license from them.
 
Immunocore Limited
 
We have an assignment and license agreement in place with Immunocore that relates to certain co-owned patents, patent applications and rights in know-how that originally was developed by Avidex and subsequently acquired by Medigene. Adaptimmune and Immunocore each utilize the jointly owned patents and know-how within separate fields or applications, with our focus being on the treatment of patients with our SPEAR T-cells and Immunocores focus being on the treatment of patients with soluble TCRs. There are no termination rights in the assignment and license agreement.
 
See further Related Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Reliance Upon Third PartiesWe have a shared development history with Immunocore and as a result jointly-own certainly intellectual property rights which are required for our ongoing business.
 
Other Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights
 
Third-party patents do exist that purport to cover some or all of our current lentiviral vectors/systems or our process for manufacture. However, the majority of these patents will expire prior to any commercial supply by us of any TCR therapeutic candidates and we do not currently require a license. Whether licenses are required under any remaining third-party patents or other third-party patents depends on what steps we take going forward in relation to our lentiviral transduction process and manufacturing process. We may, however, need to negotiate a license under any remaining third party patents or develop alternative strategies for dealing with any remaining third party patents if licenses are not available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.
 
We are aware of a family of patent applications owned by The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois which include two issued U.S. patents (U.S. 6,759,243 and 7,569,357) which were issued with very broad claims relating to high affinity TCRs. We believe that U.S. Patent 7,569,357, because of certain claim recitations, is not an impediment to the continued development of our current SPEAR T-cells. We requested re-examination of U.S. Patent 6,759,243 at the USPTO. In that re-examination, the USPTO adopted our position and rejected all claims under re-examination as anticipated or obvious, and in a related pending patent application of The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois, in an August 18, 2014 Office Action, the USPTO also adopted our position and rejected the claims based on our arguments and evidence of our re-examination request. Through the re-examination process, we have been successful in achieving a narrowing of all of the claims of U.S. Patent 6,759,243. While we believe U.S. Patent 6,759,243 will be nonetheless invalid in the form in which it will be issued after re-examination, we do not believe the patent after re-examination will be an impediment to our current SPEAR T-cells, including inter alia because of the recitations added by the patentee during re-examination and the U.S. codified doctrine of intervening rights.  Furthermore, these U.S. patents will likely expire prior to any commercial supply by us of any of our SPEAR T-cells. There are three European applications in this same family on which we have filed third party observations. Two of these applications have now been granted with claims narrowed away from Adaptimmunes activities in such a way that we do not believe the patents should create an impediment to development of our current SPEAR T-cells within Europe. The third is still pending, but we expect the examiner again to accept the same arguments we used in the other two cases.
 
From time to time, we will use samples or cell lines obtained from third parties in order to identify either suitable targets or TCRs that bind to certain targets. The agreements under which samples are provided vary between third parties and certain third parties require entry into license agreements. These agreements may also contain payment obligations relating to the use of the various samples or the information obtained from use of those samples.
 
Laws and Regulations Regarding Patent Terms
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee. A patents term may be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. The patent term of a European patent is 20 years from its effective filing date, which, unlike in the United States, is not subject to patent term adjustments in the same way as U.S. patents.
 
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years
 
16




beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, for example Supplementary Protection Certificates. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval or equivalent regulatory approval outside of the United States, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We anticipate that some of our issued patents may be eligible for patent term extensions, but such extensions may not be available and therefore our commercial monopoly may be restricted. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual PropertyWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology in the marketplace or the cost of doing so may be prohibitive or excessive.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any TCR therapeutic candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future.
 
Immunotherapy is an active area of research and a number of immune-related products have been identified in recent years that are alleged to modulate the immune system. Many of these products utilize dendritic cells, a form of immune cell that presents cancer target peptides to T cells and that can in turn result in T-cell activation.
 
More recently, bi-specific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors have been identified as having utility in the treatment of cancer. Bi-specific antibodies commonly target both the cancer peptide and the TCR, thus bringing both cancer cells and T cells into close proximity to maximize the chance of TCR binding and hence an immune response to the cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors on the other hand work by targeting receptors that inhibit T-cell effectiveness and proliferation and essentially activate the T cells.
 
Other engineered T-cell therapeutics have also been identified using antibody recognition systems engineered into T cells, so-called CAR-T cells. These and other competitors in the TCR space include: Juno Therapeutics Inc., Kite Pharma Inc. / National Institutes of Health (NIH), Medigene AG/Bluebird Bio, Inc., Eureka Therapeutics Inc., Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. and Takara Bio Inc. In the CAR-T space, competitors include: Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc. /  Celgene Corporation / Baylor College of Medicine, Cellectis SA / Pfizer Inc., Juno Therapeutics Inc. / Celgene Corporation / Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center / Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Kite Pharma, Inc. / Amgen, Inc. / NIH/, Intrexon Corporation / Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. / MD Anderson Cancer Center and Novartis AG / University of Pennsylvania.
 
We do not believe that any of these competitors offer the same form of affinity-enhancement and specificity as our engineered TCR therapeutic candidates and, due to the low presentation of target peptide-HLA antigen on relevant cancer cells, those with TCR-based approaches are unlikely to be as effective. For example, Kite Pharma Inc. is in the process of, among other things, developing genetically engineered T-cells that bind directly to cancer cells. We believe this technology relies on the modification of T cells to express certain cancer-specific receptors, namely TCRs and CAR-Ts. Novartis also has substantial interest in the development of CAR-Ts. Juno Therapeutics Inc. has developed an engineered TCR therapeutic candidate where the end TCR is purported to have enhanced affinity through stem-cell selection. The therapeutic is produced in a very different way from the affinity-enhanced TCRs we produce, and we believe there is limited ability to control the enhancement obtained. Takara Bio Inc. has developed a naturally occurring TCR that binds to a MAGE A-4 target peptide and the therapeutic is in clinical trials. The TCR is not affinity-enhanced as is the TCR for our SPEAR T-cells. Medigene AG has also reported development of a PRAME TCR therapeutic candidate and is collaborating on a MAGE-A1 TCR which is due to enter clinical trials later in 2017. Eureka Therapeutics Inc. has announced the development of CAR-T products which target peptide-HLA complexes. They have developed CAR-Ts targeting the same NY-ESO and AFP peptides as are targeted by our SPEAR T-cells. However, development still appears to be in the early stages and limited data is available to assess impact on our own SPEAR T-cells, if any. Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. has announced the development of a TCR mimetic CAR-T targeting NY-ESO-1. Adicet Bio/Regeneron Inc. has announced plans to develop TCR immunotherapy products directed to MHC-peptide complexes and Tactiva Therapeutics are developing CD-4-TCRs and CD8-TCRs targeting solid tumors expressing NY-ESO. Guangzhou Xiangxue have published a number of patent applications for TCR immunotherapy products and we understand that the company are putting an NY-ESO-1 TCR into phase I clinical trials.
 
Immune Design Corp. has a vaccine in clinical trials which is not TCR-based. The vaccine targets the NY-ESO peptide in humans and again relies on binding to target peptides presented at low levels on target cells to stimulate natural low affinity T-cell responses. The treatment is not patient-specific.

Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice (DOJ), or other governmental entities.
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the United States, therapeutic products, including drugs, biologics, and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDC Act), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Some biological products are subject to regulation under the FDC Act. Most biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) via a Biologics License Application (BLA). The application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are generally similar to those for new drug applications (NDAs), and biologics are associated with generally similar, if not greater, approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 
Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence
 
18




on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 
In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,335,000, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $110,000 per product and $569,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are reviewed within 10 months of the date the FDA files the BLA; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committeetypically a panel that includes clinicians and other expertsfor review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the products safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication may require clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
 
19




FDA Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
 
The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND application or BLA; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high.
 
If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA), pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA. In addition, many companies and other institutions not subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH convenes the RAC, a federal advisory committee, to discuss protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA notifies the FDA of the RACs decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
 
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life- threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request.
 
Under the fast track program and FDAs accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post- marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 
In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track products BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDAs time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
 
Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a
 
20




product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of human clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Additional Controls for Biologics
 
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
 
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturers tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
 
Biosimilars
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, a biological product may be deemed biosimilar to an FDA-approved biological product or reference biological product upon a showing that there are no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity generally must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. On March 6, 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation, which is still being evaluated by the FDA.
 
21




A reference biologic is granted 12 years of marketing exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and in addition no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilars application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry- sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain marketing approval through the pre-market approval (PMA) process for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDAs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the devices safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA finds the PMA application is approvable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicants agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.

After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturers manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.
 
In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Act amended the federal false claims law such that a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal false claims law. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offerer/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
 
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements
 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has issued a final rule that implements a statutory requirement under the Healthcare Reform Act that requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies that are covered under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to begin collecting and reporting annually information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers had to begin collecting information in 2013, with the first reports due in 2014. On September 30, 2014, CMS posted the first round of data in searchable form on a public website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 
In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.

Europe and Rest of the World Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions both due to our location and the fact that we are engaging in clinical programs outside of the United States and will want to obtain worldwide regulatory approval for our TCR therapeutic candidates. Prior to supplying any TCR therapeutic candidate in any country or starting any clinical trials in any country outside of the United States we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in such countries. The existence of a United States regulatory approval does not guarantee that regulatory approvals will be obtained in other countries in which we wish to conduct clinical trials or market our TCR therapeutic candidates. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each countrys national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively prior to any clinical trial being conducted in the relevant country. A marketing authorization is then submitted prior to any commercial supply, again to each relevant countrys national health authority.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. However these requirements may well differ from country to country.
 
Review and Approval of Drug Products outside of the United States
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Procedures Governing Approval of Products in the EU
 
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.

The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member states assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
