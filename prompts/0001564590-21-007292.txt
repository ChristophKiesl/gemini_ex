 Note on the COVID-19 Pandemic
 While the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on our business, operations, and financial performance, we have taken and plan to continue to take steps to evaluate, monitor, manage, and respond to the challenges that have arisen from the COVID-19 pandemic and to new challenges that may arise. We continue to operate under a remote operating model for all employees other than certain members of our laboratory and facilities staff. As part of this remote operating model, our laboratory staff who engage in research and development activities continue to have restricted access to our laboratories. Accordingly, our laboratory staff are not yet back to their full daily output as existed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic We continue to evaluate our remote operating model for our offices based on guidance from federal, state and local government authorities, and we expect that some form of this remote operating model will exist for us through at least the first half of 2021.
 In addition, although the initiation, enrollment and completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials are on schedule, we are aware of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on other clinical trials in our industry and there is a risk of material impact on the conduct of our clinical trials as well. We are continuing to work with our clinical trial sites to ensure study continuity, enable medical monitoring, facilitate study procedures and maintain clinical data and records, including the use of local laboratories for testing, home delivery of study drug and remote data and records monitoring.
 To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our supply chain, and we currently have a consistent supply of tazemetostat and TAZVERIK that we believe will cover our ongoing clinical development as well as the ongoing commercialization for epithelioid sarcoma, or ES, and follicular lymphoma, or FL. As a proactive measure, we have taken certain steps to try to reduce the risk to our supply chain, such as advancing orders for long-lead items in anticipation of potential future delays or shortages. Because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely impact our suppliers and result in delays or disruptions in our current or future supply chain, we are continuing to monitor and manage our supply chain accordingly. 
 For our ongoing commercialization activities for TAZVERIK, our commercial and medical affairs field teams are continuing to use virtual formats where possible in order to allow us to serve the needs of healthcare providers, patients and other stakeholders during this critical time. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively impact ES and FL patient visits to physicians, new patient starts across all lines of treatment as well as the ability of our field-based teams to fully access ES and FL prescribers, and these challenges continued in the first quarter of 2021. Notwithstanding these challenges, new prescriptions for TAZVERIK in FL have increased month over month and are being written for both EZH2 mutation and wild-type patients; in the academic and community settings; and across multiple treatment lines in relapsed or refractory FL patients. In addition, payor coverage for ES and FL continues to be in-line with the TAZVERIK label. We continue to adapt our commercial strategy to the COVID-19 pandemic to support increased adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients. 
 We continue to assess the potential duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, operations and financial performance, and we continue to work closely with our third-party vendors, collaborators and other parties in order to seek to continue to advance our commercialization efforts of TAZVERIK and to continue to advance the development of our pipeline, as quickly as possible, while making the health and safety of our employees and their families, healthcare providers, patients and communities a top priority. Due to the evolving and uncertain global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we cannot precisely determine or quantify the impact that this pandemic has had on our business, operations and financial performance or the impact that this pandemic will have in 2021 and beyond.
 Please refer to our Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that is committed to rewriting treatment for people with cancer and other serious diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel epigenetic medicines. By focusing on the genetic drivers of disease, our science seeks to match targeted medicines with the patients who need them. 
 
In January 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted accelerated approval of TAZVERIK (tazemetostat), an oral, first in class, selective small molecule inhibitor of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase, or HMT, for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. This approval was based on overall response rate and duration of response shown in the ES cohort of our Phase 2 trial in patients with INI1-negative tumors. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States. 
 
As part of the accelerated approval for ES, continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for this indication, we are conducting a single global, randomized, controlled Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial assessing TAZVERIK in combination with doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin plus placebo as a front-line treatment for ES. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 152 patients. The safety run-in portion of the trial is fully enrolled and we expect to commence the efficacy portion of the trial in 2021. We anticipate reporting safety and preliminary activity data from the safety run-in portion of the study at a medical meeting in 2021.  
 
In June 2020, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for TAZVERIK for the following FL indications: (1) adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and (2) adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. These indications were approved under accelerated approval with a priority review, based on overall response rate and duration of response shown in the FL cohorts of our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with EZH2 mutations and wild-type EZH2. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.
 
As part of the accelerated approval for FL, continued approval for these indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for these indications, we are conducting a single global, randomized, adaptive Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial assessing the combination of TAZVERIK with “R2” (Revlimid® plus rituximab), an approved chemotherapy-free treatment regimen, compared with R2 plus placebo for FL patients in the second-line or later treatment setting. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 500 FL patients, stratified based on their EZH2 mutation status. The safety run-in portion of the trial is fully enrolled and we expect to commence the efficacy portion of the trial in 2021. We anticipate reporting safety and preliminary activity data from the safety run-in portion of the study at a medical meeting in 2021. In addition, we plan to conduct post-marketing commitments, including expanding our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial with a cohort of FL patients with wild-type EZH2 to evaluate tazemetostat as a monotherapy in patients who have been treated with at least one prior systemic treatment, in order to inform the label and potentially expand it in the approved indications in the relapsed and refractory setting in the future.  
 
Through our planned development efforts, our intention is to eventually make TAZVERIK available in all lines of treatment for patients with FL. We plan to leverage the confirmatory trial and post-marketing commitments to expand TAZVERIK into the second-line treatment setting. In collaboration with The Lymphoma Study Association, or LYSA, and based on clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP as a front-line treatment for patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, we commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial that is being conducted by LYSA evaluating this combination as a front-line treatment for high-risk patients with FL. We are also supporting an investigator-sponsored study to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with rituximab with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings, which is currently enrolling. We intend to have this investigator-sponsored study transferred to a Company sponsored study in 2021. In addition, we are finalizing plans for investigator-sponsored studies to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with venetoclax or BTK inhibitors for the treatment of patients with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings.

We are developing tazemetostat for the treatment of a broad range of cancer types in multiple treatment settings. Tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as an investigational monotherapy in multiple cancer indications and has been generally well-tolerated across clinical trials to date. We believe tazemetostat is a “pipeline in a product” opportunity and plan to advance life-cycle development for tazemetostat to support its potential utility in additional indications and combinations. 
 
In connection with these efforts, we are conducting a global, multi-center, randomized Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating tazemetostat in combination with enzalutamide or abiraterone, the standard of care treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, plus prednisone in chemo-naïve patients with mCRPC.  The safety run-in portion of the trial is fully enrolled and we expect to commence the efficacy portion of the trial in 2021. We anticipate reporting safety and preliminary activity data from the safety run-in portion of the study at a medical meeting in 2021.  
 
There are four areas where we see the greatest potential for tazemetostat, all of which are based on a strong scientific hypothesis and for diseases that need a new effective and safe treatment option, including: 
  
• | Lymphomas and B-cell malignancies, such as DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, chronic myeloid leukaemia, or CML, and others;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecularly defined solid tumors, such as chordoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, and tumors harboring an EZH2 or SWI/SNF alteration;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Chemotherapy or treatment-resistant tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and as described above, mCRPC; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immuno-oncology-sensitive tumors, such as colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, soft tissue sarcomas and non-small cell lung cancer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan. Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, holds the rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan.
 TAZVERIK is available to eligible patients in the United States via a specialty distribution network. To commercialize TAZVERIK for the ES and FL indications in the United States, we have built a focused field presence and marketing capabilities. This includes an efficiently sized field-based organization of approximately 76 individuals. 
 For geographies outside the United States, we are evaluating the most efficient path to obtain marketing approval, commercialize and distribute TAZVERIK to reach patients, including through potential strategic collaborations.
 In Europe, we are continuing to explore and understand what may be necessary in order for us to submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in an effort to obtain marketing approval of tazemetostat from the EMA in ES and FL.
 Tazemetostat is covered by claims of U.S. and European composition of matter patents, which are expected to expire in 2032, exclusive of any patent term or other extensions. Tazemetostat has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in patients with relapsed or refractory FL, relapsed or refractory DLBCL with EZH2 activating mutations and metastatic or locally advanced ES who have progressed on or following an anthracycline-based treatment regimen. The FDA has also granted orphan drug designation to tazemetostat for the treatment of patients with malignant rhabdoid tumors, or MRT, soft tissue sarcoma, or STS, and mesothelioma, and a seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period for the treatment of patients with FL.
 Beyond tazemetostat, we are utilizing our drug discovery platform to progress preclinical efforts and discover and identify additional product candidates to expand our pipeline of inhibitors against several classes of chromatin modifying proteins, or CMPs, including HMTs, histone acetyltransferases, or HATs, and helicases.

To date, we have entered into various strategic collaborations, including therapeutic collaborations and other collaborations, including with Glaxo Group Limited (an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline plc), or GSK, Eisai, Roche and other third parties. As one of several key aspects of our strategy, we plan to continue to leverage our existing collaborations and to seek to identify new strategic collaborations to further support and grow our business in and outside of the United States.
 Our Corporate Strategy 
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing novel epigenetic therapies for people with cancer and other serious diseases. With the launch of TAZVERIK in the United States in 2020, we have transitioned to a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company commercializing our first product.
The key elements of our corporate strategy are to: 
  
• | successfully commercialize TAZVERIK in the United States for the treatment of ES and FL patients in the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advance life-cycle development for tazemetostat to support its potential utility in additional indications and combinations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leverage existing and enter into new strategic collaborations that can contribute to our ability to rapidly develop and commercialize TAZVERIK and any product candidates we may identify and develop, including developing and commercializing TAZVERIK and any product candidates we may identify and develop outside of the United States; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | utilize our drug discovery platform to progress preclinical efforts and pursue additional product candidates to expand our pipeline of inhibitors against several classes of CMPs, including HMTs, HATs, and helicases.

 TAZVERIK (tazemetostat) for Epithelioid Sarcoma 
 In January 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval of TAZVERIK (tazemetostat) for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. This approval was based on overall response rate and duration of response shown in an open-label, single-arm cohort of a multi-cohort, global Phase 2 trial of tazemetostat in adults with INI1-negative tumors. The cohort was conducted in 62 patients with histologically confirmed, metastatic or locally advanced ES. Patients were required to have INI1 loss, detected using local tests, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, or ECOG PS, of 0-2. Patients in the cohort received TAZVERIK 800 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor response assessments were performed every eight weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed overall response rate, or ORR, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, v1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central review and duration of response. Median duration of follow-up was 14 months (range 0.4 to 31).
 Among the 62 patients who received TAZVERIK, the median age was 34 years (range 16 to 79); 63% were male, 76% were White, 11% were Asian, 44% had proximal disease, 92% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and 8% had an ECOG PS of 2. Prior surgery occurred in 77% of patients; 61% received prior systemic chemotherapy.
 In the total 62 patients treated, the overall response rate (95% confidence interval) was 15% (7%, 26%), with 1.6% of patients achieving a complete response and 13% achieving a partial response. Among responders in the trial, 67% had a duration of response of six months or longer as of the data cutoff date of September 17, 2018. 
 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37% of patients receiving TAZVERIK. The serious adverse reactions in ≥3% of patients who received TAZVERIK were hemorrhage, pleural effusion, skin infection, dyspnea, pain, and respiratory distress.
 7


One patient (2%) permanently discontinued TAZVERIK due to an adverse reaction of altered mood.
 Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients who received TAZVERIK. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring dosage interruptions in ≥3% of patients were hemorrhage, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Dose reduction due to an adverse reaction occurred in one (2%) patient who received TAZVERIK due to decreased appetite.
 The most common adverse reactions (≥20%, any grade) were pain, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, and constipation.
 The label for TAZVERIK includes warning and precautions for the increase in risk of developing secondary malignancies following treatment with TAZVERIK and the risk of embryo fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women.
 Additionally, The Lancet Oncology published results of our Phase 2 trial evaluating TAZVERIK for the treatment of ES in October 2020.
 We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.
 TAZVERIK for Epithelioid Sarcoma Post-Marketing Requirements
 
As part of the accelerated approval for epithelioid sarcoma, continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of tazemetostat for this indication, we are conducting a global 1:1 randomized, controlled Phase 1b/3 clinical trial in the front-line treatment setting comparing TAZVERIK in combination with doxorubicin, a commonly used systemic treatment in this setting, versus placebo plus doxorubicin. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 152 ES patients. The primary efficacy endpoint is progression-free survival, and secondary efficacy endpoints include overall survival, disease control rate, overall response rate, duration of response and health-related quality of life. The safety run-in portion of the trial is fully enrolled and we expect to commence the efficacy portion of the trial in 2021. We anticipate reporting safety and preliminary activity data from the safety run-in portion of the study at a medical meeting in 2021.  
 
We have several additional post-marketing activities underway, intended to address aspects of the label in the future. These include clinical pharmacology evaluations to assess the effect of TAZVERIK on liver function and the effect of CYP3A inhibitors and inducers on TAZVERIK for patients with ES. We have also expanded enrollment in a cohort of our Phase 2 study in adults with INI1-negative tumors, to enroll a total of at least 60 epithelioid sarcoma patients. The cohort is a paired biopsy cohort designed to assess potential immune biomarkers, and the expansion is intended to provide more experience in patients with ES.
 
Background on ES: Epithelioid sarcoma is an ultra-rare and aggressive type of soft tissue sarcoma, comprising less than 1 percent of all soft tissue sarcoma cases, and is characterized by a loss of the INI1 protein. It is most commonly diagnosed in young adults (20-40 years old) and is often fatal. There is no established standard-of-care for treating these patients, who are typically resistant to chemotherapy. Patients diagnosed with metastatic disease typically have a 5-year overall survival rate of 0 percent and there are no approved treatment options specifically indicated for epithelioid sarcoma other than TAZVERIK. Typically, once patients have been deemed appropriate for systemic therapy, most are treated with chemotherapy. There are an estimated 800 patients in the United States living with epithelioid sarcoma with approximately 300 patients with metastatic or locally advanced disease that are eligible for systemic therapy.
 
TAZVERIK for Follicular Lymphoma
 In June 2020, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for TAZVERIK for the following FL indications: (1) adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and (2) adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. These

indications were approved under accelerated approval with a priority review, based on overall response rate and duration of response shown in the FL cohorts of our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with EZH2 mutations and wild-type EZH2. 
 TAZVERIK was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm, multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with histologically confirmed FL whose disease had progressed following at least two prior systemic treatment regimens. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts: one cohort enrolled 45 patients with EZH2 activating mutations and a second cohort enrolled 54 patients with wild-type EZH2. All patients were treated with 800 mg of tazemetostat, administered orally twice a day. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) according to the International Working Group Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (IWG-NHL) criteria (Cheson 2007) as assessed by Independent Review Committee. Median duration of follow-up was 22 months for patients with EZH2 activating mutations and 36 months for patients with wild-type EZH2.
 Among the 45 FL patients with an EZH2 activating mutation who received TAZVERIK, the median age was 62 years (range 38 to 80); 42% were male; 42% had early progression following front-line therapy (POD24); and all had an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. The median number of lines of prior systemic therapy was 2.0 (range 1 to 11); 49% were refractory to rituximab and 49% were refractory to their last therapy. In the 42 patients treated with at least 2 prior systemic therapies, the ORR (95% confidence interval) was 69% (53%, 82%), with 12% of patients achieving a complete response and 57% achieving a partial response. The median DOR was 10.9 months and ongoing.
 Among the 54 FL patients with wild-type EZH2 who received TAZVERIK, the median age was 61 years (range 36 to 87); 63% were male; 59% had POD24; and 91% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. The median number of lines of prior systemic therapy was 3.0 (range 1 to 8); 59% were refractory to rituximab and 41% were refractory to their last therapy. In the 53 patients treated with at least 2 prior systemic therapies, the ORR (95% confidence interval) was 34% (22%, 48%), with 4% of patients achieving a complete response and 30% achieving a partial response. The median DOR was 13.0 months.
 Serious adverse reactions, irrespective of attribution, occurred in 30% of patients receiving TAZVERIK. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% of patients who received TAZVERIK were general physical health deterioration, abdominal pain, pneumonia, sepsis, and anemia. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions are fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, musculoskeletal pain, nausea and abdominal pain.
 Eight patients (8%) discontinued due to adverse reaction during the trial. There were no reported deaths on study, and no black box warnings or contraindications.
 Additionally, The Lancet Oncology published results of our Phase 2 trial evaluating TAZVERIK for the treatment of FL in October 2020.
 We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.
 Background on FL: Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent lymphoma and the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma – accounting for about 10-20% of all lymphomas in Western countries. FL is considered to be incurable with existing treatments and is characterized by cycles of relapse that become increasingly difficult to treat with each disease progression. We estimate that approximately 14,000 patients are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma in the United States annually, of whom the majority have advanced disease at diagnosis. We estimate that there are approximately 10,000 patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease in the United States. Based on literature and an extensive natural history study that we conducted, we believe that approximately 20% of FL tumors carry an EZH2 activating mutation. Common treatments for FL include multi-agent chemotherapy, usually combined with rituximab (RITUXAN), including R-CHOP and R-Bendamustine. Upon clinical progression, treatment regimens are typically other combinations of rituximab, and other chemotherapy regimens, utilization of off-label agents, clinical trials or one of the four approved PI3k inhibitors: duvelisib, idealisib, copanlisib or umbralisib.

TAZVERIK for Follicular Lymphoma Post-Marketing Requirements
 As part of the accelerated approval for FL, continued approval for these indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for these indications, we are conducting a single global, randomized, adaptive Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial to evaluate the combination of TAZVERIK with “R2” (Revlimid plus rituximab) compared with R2 plus placebo for FL patients in the second-line or later treatment setting. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 500 FL patients, stratified based on their EZH2 mutation status. The safety run-in portion of the trial is fully enrolled and we expect to commence the efficacy portion of the trial in 2021. We anticipate reporting safety and preliminary activity data from the safety run-in portion of the study at a medical meeting in 2021.  
 In addition, we plan to conduct post-marketing commitments, including expanding our ongoing Phase 2 relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, clinical trial with a cohort of FL patients with wild-type EZH2 to evaluate tazemetostat as a monotherapy in patients who have been treated with at least one prior systemic treatment, in order to inform the label and potentially expand in the relapsed and refractory setting in the future.  
 FL Development Expansion: Through our planned development efforts, our intention is to make TAZVERIK available in all lines of treatment for patients with FL. We plan to leverage the confirmatory trial to expand TAZVERIK into the second-line treatment setting. 
 In collaboration with The Lymphoma Study Association, or LYSA, a premier cooperative group in France dedicated to clinical and translational research for lymphoma, and based on clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in a combination Phase 1b/2 study with R-CHOP as a front-line treatment for patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, a Phase 2 clinical expansion trial was commenced that is being conducted by LYSA evaluating this combination as a front-line treatment for high-risk patients with FL. The Phase 1b part of the study has completed, and we are currently enrolling for high-risk patients with both FL and DLBCL in the Phase 2 trial. 
 We are also supporting an investigator-sponsored study to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with rituximab with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings, which is currently enrolling. We intend to have this investigator-sponsored study transferred to a Company-sponsored study in 2021. In addition, we are finalizing plans for investigator-sponsored studies to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with venetoclax or BTK inhibitors for the treatment of patients with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings.  
 Tazemetostat Life-Cycle Development 
 Tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as an investigational monotherapy in multiple cancer indications and has been generally well-tolerated across clinical trials to date. We believe tazemetostat is a “pipeline in a product” opportunity and plan to explore its utility in additional indications and combinations through both company and investigator sponsored studies. There are four areas where we see the greatest potential for tazemetostat, all of which are based on a strong scientific hypothesis and for diseases that need a new effective and safe treatment option.
 Lymphomas and B-Cell Malignancies
 We are developing tazemetostat for lymphomas and B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL, MCL, CLL, and CML, because of the role EZH2 plays in B-cell biology. When oncogenic mutations occur, they can “lock” B-cells in the germinal center state, leading to a variety of hematologic cancers. Regardless of the oncogenic mutation, these cancer cells are governed by EZH2 expression, which enables their growth and proliferation. By inhibiting EZH2, we believe we can inhibit tumor proliferation, leading to anti-tumor activity, as seen in FL patients with wild-type EZH2. 
 DLBCL Combination with R-CHOP. In collaboration with LYSA, we are conducting a multi-center Phase 1b/2 trial of tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP in front-line, elderly high-risk patients with DLBCL. The trial is expected to enroll up to 133 patients. Primary endpoints in the trial include complete response rate, safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints include ORR and progression-free survival, or PFS. The trial was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016. At ASH 2018, LYSA reported interim data from 17 patients in the trial as 
 10


of March 2018 showing that the combination of the two agents had been generally well-tolerated and confirming the recommended tazemetostat dose for the combination to be 800 mg twice-daily. Clinical activity was observed, with 87 percent of patients experiencing a metabolic complete response. We agreed in 2020 to expand the trial to also include an expansion cohort for the front-line treatment of high-risk patients with FL.  The Phase 1b part of the study has completed, and we commenced a Phase 2 clinical expansion trial in front-line treatment and are enrolling for high-risk patients with both FL and DLBCL.  
 Molecularly Defined Solid Tumors
We are exploring the use of tazemetostat to treat multiple molecularly defined solid tumors, such as chordoma, melanoma, mesothelioma and tumors with a SWI/SNF alteration or other mutations. In these tumors, a loss of certain proteins or the presence of a certain mutation can result in abnormal EZH2 activity or exaggerated dependence on EZH2, which leads to cancer cell growth. By inhibiting EZH2 with tazemetostat, we believe we can inhibit that abnormal function, thereby indirectly restoring cells to their natural state, which could result in a therapeutic benefit.
 Adults with INI1-Negative Tumors: We are assessing tazemetostat for the treatment of adults with chordoma in a cohort of our ongoing global Phase 2 trial in adults with INI1-negative tumors. Patients in the cohort are dosed at 800 mg twice daily with tablets taken orally. The primary endpoint for the trial is overall response rate. The cohort is open for enrollment.  
 Pediatrics with INI1-Negative Tumors: We are conducting a global Phase 1 clinical trial of tazemetostat in approximately 110 children with INI1-negative solid tumors. In the trial, we are using an oral suspension formula of tazemetostat. The primary endpoint of the trial is safety, with the objective of establishing the recommended Phase 2 dose in pediatric patients. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, objective response rate, duration of response, PFS and overall survival. We have completed the dose-escalation portion of the trial and have advanced to the dose-expansion stage of this trial.
 Chemotherapeutic/Treatment-Resistant Tumors
 We are assessing the use of tazemetostat for solid tumors that are resistant to chemotherapy or other treatments, such as triple negative breast, small cell lung and ovarian cancers, and castration-resistant prostate cancer. When chemotherapy is given, DNA becomes damaged, resulting in abnormal or overactive EZH2 activity. This prevents transcription of certain genetic markers, which leads to cancer cell growth. By adding an EZH2 inhibitor, like tazemetostat, we believe we can turn that disease-targeting genetic marker back on, resulting in a re-sensitization of the tumor to chemotherapy or other treatments. In addition, EZH2 plays a role in the resistance to poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors. When PARP inhibitors are given, DNA is damaged, which leads to increased EZH2 activity and limits the responsiveness to the PARP inhibitor. By blocking EZH2 with tazemetostat, we believe we can also re-sensitize tumors to PARP inhibition treatment.
 Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed and second most frequent cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. We believe, based on published literature, that EZH2 protein expression has been correlated with progression of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC; moderate to high EZH2 expression has been associated with worse survival; and, treatment with an EZH2 inhibitor after resistance to the standards-of-care may result in recovery of sensitivity to these agents. We are conducting a global, multi-center, randomized Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating tazemetostat in combination with enzalutamide or abiraterone, the standard of care treatments for this disease, plus prednisone in chemo-naïve patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The safety run-in portion of the trial is fully enrolled and we expect to commence the efficacy portion of the trial in 2021. We anticipate reporting safety and preliminary activity data from the safety run-in portion of the study at a medical meeting in 2021.  
 Platinum-Resistant Solid Tumors: We are planning to investigate the therapeutic potential of tazemetostat as a combination therapy with a PARP inhibitor for the treatment of platinum-resistant tumors, such as small-cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In platinum-resistant cancers, PARP inhibitors have shown modest monotherapy activity, and we believe tazemetostat may have the potential to enhance the clinical response to PARP inhibitors. We have completed the preclinical development to determine the potential design of a clinical trial, which includes selecting the PARP inhibitor to administer in combination with tazemetostat. We are evaluating the preclinical data and plan to begin this trial in 2021.

Immuno-oncology-sensitive Tumors
 We are assessing the use of tazemetostat for immuno-oncology-sensitive tumors, such as colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, soft tissue sarcomas and non-small cell lung cancer. We believe tazemetostat may enhance the antitumor immune response by interfering with multiple EZH2 functions in the cell. EZH2 inhibition results in tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic effects that reshape the tumor microenvironment to favor antitumor immunity, including increasing antigen presentation, increasing effector T cell trafficking, modulating the adaptive anti-tumor response, impairing regulatory T cells, inducing the expression of tumor antigens and endogenous retroviruses, and increasing NK cell maturation and killing. By inhibiting EZH2, we believe we can influence biologic activity in the tumor microenvironment, which could enable tumors to be more sensitive or re-sensitized to immune-oncology therapies. 
 Tazemetostat CRADA with NCI
 In October 2016, we announced a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, to evaluate tazemetostat in clinical trials in a variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Under this CRADA, we are evaluating tazemetostat in a Phase 2 clinical trial in adult patients with ovarian cancer and in a Phase 2 trial in pediatric patients with solid tumors and lymphoma. As part of the CRADA, we may undertake additional clinical trials. NCI will predominantly fund the studies and manage trial operations.
 The NCI’s Pediatric MATCH trial includes a Phase 2 evaluation of tazemetostat as one of its treatment cohorts. Conducted under our CRADA executed with NCI in 2016, this multi-institutional trial is evaluating tazemetostat as a monotherapy for pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors, including CNS tumors, NHL or histiocytic disorders that harbor EZH2 activating mutations, or loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF complex subunits SMARCB1 or SMARCA4. The Pediatric MATCH trial, conducted by the Children’s Oncology Group, aims to match targeted agents, such as tazemetostat, with specific molecular changes identified through genomic sequencing of refractory or recurrent tumors from children and adolescents with cancer is now enrolling patients.
 Research Pipeline
 Beyond tazemetostat, we are utilizing our drug discovery platform to progress preclinical efforts and discover and identify additional product candidates to expand our pipeline of inhibitors against several classes of CMPs, including HMTs, HATs, and helicases. These programs are directed against both hematological malignancies and solid tumors and include biomarker approaches to patient stratification. 
 Under our collaboration with GSK, GSK is developing two small molecule inhibitors against novel HMT targets, that were discovered by us using our proprietary drug discovery platform. In September 2016, GSK advanced the first of these programs into clinical testing. This drug candidate, GSK3326595, a PRMT5 inhibitor, is currently being tested in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors and NHL. In 2018, GSK initiated patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of GSK3368715, a PRMT1 inhibitor.
 In November 2018, we entered into a global collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel small molecules, directed toward two previously undisclosed epigenetic targets as potential therapies for people with cancer. Specifically, these targets are enzymes within the helicase and HAT families that when dysregulated have been linked to the development of cancers that currently lack therapeutic options. Boehringer Ingelheim terminated the collaboration without cause by notice to us in December 2020, and as agreed, the termination became effective on January 31, 2021. As a result of the termination, we are entitled to pursue the HAT target and helicase target programs in all fields worldwide without further obligation to Boehringer Ingelheim.
 In April 2012, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene.  Under our collaboration with Celgene, we developed small molecule inhibitors directed to three HMT targets, in addition to pinometostat. Under the collaboration, we were responsible for all preclinical discovery work as well as Phase 1 clinical development for all three targets. Celgene had the option to acquire worldwide rights to inhibitors directed at two of the three targets, and the option to acquire ex-U.S. rights to inhibitors directed to the third target. On November 3, 2020, Celgene terminated the collaboration and license agreement without cause, effective January 2, 2021.

Pinometostat for DOT1L Cancers 
 DOT1L is an HMT that can become oncogenic and cause certain subtypes of acute leukemia, such as MLL-r. We discovered pinometostat using our proprietary drug discovery product platform. Following the termination of our collaboration agreement with Celgene, we have worldwide rights to pinometostat.
 Pinometostat has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL.
 Under the CRADA that we entered with the NCI in October 2016 for pinometostat, the NCI has agreed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pinometostat in patients with acute leukemias. Initial studies will evaluate the combination of pinometostat with standard-of-care therapies or targeted agents in acute leukemia. As part of the agreement, additional clinical trials will be considered. NCI will predominantly fund the studies and manage trial operations.
 Our Epigenetic Approach 
 Epigenetics refers to a broad regulatory system that controls gene expression without altering the sequence of the genes themselves. Genes are composed of DNA, and in nature, this DNA is wrapped around a core of proteins known as histones. Together, the DNA and histone proteins form a complex known as chromatin that is the basic structural component of chromosomes. 
 Gene regulation is determined by chromatin structure. The dynamics of chromatin structure are regulated through multiple mechanisms by CMPs. Some CMPs place chemical groups onto specific sites on histones or DNA, some remove these marks in site-specific ways, others recognize the uniquely marked sites on histones and bind to these marked sites, and still other CMPs drive topological changes to histone-DNA interactions within chromatin. Where, when and how such chromatin structure changes occur, determines which genes in a cell are turned “on” or “off” at any particular time. When the function of these CMPs is altered, the program of gene expression is changed in ways that can lead to disease. 
 To further support our leadership position in epigenetics, we are discovering and developing inhibitors of CMPs as novel therapeutics for patients with cancer and other diseases. Our focus is on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule inhibitors of CMPs for applications in diseases that are uniquely dependent on the enzyme activity of a specific CMP. Among the CMP target classes, we have had a particular emphasis on the HMTs, which have been shown to play pathogenic roles in a number of human diseases. Today, we have programs in HMTs as well as additional target classes, including HATs, and helicases. Targeting pathogenic CMPs affords us multiple opportunities to create, develop and commercialize novel therapeutics.
 Our Collaborations  
 We have entered into several key strategic collaborations, including therapeutic collaborations and other collaborations. The therapeutic collaborations have provided us with $243.8 million in non-equity funding through December 31, 2020. Key terms of our ongoing collaborations are summarized below. 
GSK 
 Overview. In January 2011, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with GSK, to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule HMT inhibitors directed to available targets from our product platform. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted GSK exclusive worldwide license rights to HMT inhibitors directed to three targets. Additionally, as part of the research collaboration, we agreed to provide research and development services related to the licensed targets pursuant to agreed-upon research plans during a research term that ended January 8, 2015. In March 2014, we and GSK amended certain terms of this agreement, including revising the definition of licensed compounds and amending the corresponding financial terms, including reallocating milestone payments and increasing royalty rates, for one target. Subsequent to a GSK strategic portfolio prioritization, we received notice in October 2017 that GSK terminated the agreement with respect to the third target, effective December 31, 2017, which returned all rights to that target to us. The two other targets, PRMT5 and PRMT1, continue to be subject to the agreement and were not impacted by the termination with respect to the third target. We 
 13


substantially completed all research obligations under this agreement by the end of the first quarter of 2015 and completed the transfer of the remaining data and material for these programs to GSK in the second quarter of 2015. GSK is responsible for all future development and commercialization.
 Under the agreement, we have received and recognized collaboration revenue totaling $89.0 million, consisting of upfront payments, fixed research funding, research and development services and preclinical and research milestone payments. As of December 31, 2020, for the two remaining targets, we are eligible to earn up to $50.0 million in clinical development milestone payments, up to $197.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $128.0 million in sales-based milestone payments. As a result of the termination of the agreement as it relates to the third target, we will receive no additional payments related to that target. In addition, GSK is required to pay us royalties, at percentages from the mid-single digits to the low double-digits, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, on worldwide net product sales, subject to reduction in specified circumstances. Due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development, the Company may not receive any additional milestone payments or royalty payments from GSK. 
 Exclusivity Provisions. Subject to exceptions specified in the agreement, during the term of the agreement, neither we nor GSK may research, develop or commercialize HMT inhibitors directed to the two targets selected by GSK, other than pursuant to the agreement. 
 Term and Termination. The agreement will expire in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms for all licensed products in all countries. The royalty term for each licensed product in each country is the period commencing with first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ending on the later of expiration of specified patent coverage or ten years following the first commercial sale. GSK has the right to terminate the agreement at any time with respect to one or more selected targets or in its entirety, upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us. The agreement may also be terminated with respect to one or more selected targets or in its entirety by either GSK or us in the event of a material breach by the other party. The agreement may be terminated with respect to selected targets by us in the event GSK participates or actively assists in a legal challenge to one of the patents exclusively licensed to GSK under the agreement with respect to the applicable selected target. 
Eisai 
 Overview. In March 2015, we entered into an amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai, under which we reacquired worldwide rights, excluding Japan, to our EZH2 program, including tazemetostat. Under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement, we will be responsible for global development, manufacturing and commercialization outside of Japan of tazemetostat and any other EZH2 product candidates, with Eisai retaining development and commercialization rights in Japan, as well as a right to elect to manufacture tazemetostat and any other EZH2 product candidates in Japan, including the right of first negotiation for the rest of Asia. Eisai waived its right of first negotiation for the rest of Asia in 2018. Under the original collaboration and license agreement, we had granted Eisai an exclusive worldwide license to our small molecule HMT inhibitors directed to EZH2, including tazemetostat, while retaining an opt-in right to co-develop, co-commercialize and share profits with Eisai as to licensed products in the United States. 
 Upon the execution of the amended and restated collaboration agreement in March 2015, we agreed to pay Eisai a $40.0 million upfront payment. We also agreed to pay Eisai up to $20.0 million in clinical development milestone payments, including a $10.0 million milestone payment upon the earlier of initiation of a first phase 3 clinical trial of any EZH2 product or the first submission of an NDA or Market Authorization Application, or MAA, and a $10.0 million milestone upon the earlier of initiation of a first phase 3 clinical trial of any EZH2 product or the first submission of an NDA or MAA for a second indication, and up to $50.0 million in regulatory milestone payments, including a $25.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval of the first NDA or MAA, and a $25.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval of the NDA or MAA for the second indication. We are obligated to pay royalties at a percentage in the mid-teens on worldwide net sales of any EZH2 product, excluding net sales in Japan. In 2019, Eisai sold its rights to these royalties to RPI Finance Trust, which has agreed to certain reductions in these royalties in the event certain net sales thresholds are achieved. We are eligible to receive from Eisai royalties at a percentage in the mid-teens on net sales of any EZH2 product in Japan. In November 2019, we sold our rights to these royalties to RPI Finance Trust. In 2019, we triggered the payment of the two $10.0 million milestone payments upon the submission of the NDAs for accelerated approval of tazemetostat for epithelioid 
 14


sarcoma and follicular lymphoma. In January 2020, we triggered the payment of the $25.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval in the United States of tazemetostat for epithelioid sarcoma and in June 2020 we triggered the payment of an additional $25.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval in the United States of tazemetostat for follicular lymphoma.
 Under the original agreement, Eisai was solely responsible for funding all research, development and commercialization costs for licensed compounds. Under the amended and restated agreement, we are solely responsible for funding global development, manufacturing and commercialization costs for EZH2 compounds outside of Japan, and Eisai is solely responsible for funding Japan-specific development and commercialization costs for EZH2 compounds. In connection with the amended and restated agreement, we and Eisai agreed to the transition to us of ongoing development and manufacturing activities that were being conducted by or on behalf of Eisai. In January 2017, as part of Eisai’s obligations under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, Eisai enrolled and dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 study of tazemetostat in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL in Japan.
 In the event that we are awarded a priority review voucher from the FDA with respect to an EZH2 product, Eisai is entitled to specified compensation if we use the voucher on a non-EZH2 program or sell the voucher to a third party. 
 Governance. Under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement, development will be guided by a joint steering committee, with our company retaining final decision-making authority with respect to global development other than with respect to Japan-specific development and commercialization. 
 Exclusivity Restrictions. Subject to exceptions specified in the agreement, for an exclusivity period extending until eight years after the first commercial sale of a product covered by the agreement, neither we nor Eisai may research, develop or commercialize HMT inhibitors directed to EZH2, other than pursuant to the agreement. 
 Term and Termination. Our agreement with Eisai will remain in effect until the expiration of all payment obligations under the agreement with respect to all licensed products. The royalty term for each licensed product in each country commences on the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ends on the latest of expiration of specified patent coverage, expiration of specified regulatory exclusivity or ten years following the first commercial sale. We or Eisai may terminate the agreement for convenience as to our respective territories, upon 90 days’ prior written notice. The agreement will also terminate as to our territory if we cease all development and commercialization activities for the United States and specified major countries in Europe and as to Eisai’s territory if Eisai ceases all development and commercialization activities for Japan. The agreement may also be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or by us in the event Eisai, or an affiliate or sublicensee, participates or actively assists in an action or proceeding challenging or denying the validity of one of our patents. If we terminate the agreement for our convenience, the agreement terminates as a result of our cessation of development and commercialization activities or Eisai terminates the agreement for our uncured material breach, Eisai may elect to have worldwide development and commercialization rights revert to Eisai, and if Eisai so elects, Eisai will be required to pay us specified royalties on net sales of the licensed products and reimburse certain development expenses incurred by us. If Eisai terminates the agreement for its convenience, the agreement terminates as a result of Eisai’s cessation of development and commercialization activities or we terminate the agreement for Eisai’s uncured material breach or Eisai’s, or its affiliate’s or sublicensee’s, participation in, or assistance with, an action or proceeding challenging or denying the validity of one of our patents, Japanese development and commercialization rights to the licensed products revert to us, and we will be required to pay Eisai specified royalties on net sales of licensed products in Japan. 
LYSARC 
 In May 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Lymphoma Academic Research Organization, or LYSARC, to conduct a combination trial of tazemetostat. LYSARC is the operational arm of the Lymphoma Study Association, or LYSA, a premier cooperative group in France dedicated to clinical and translational research for lymphoma. This Phase 1b/2 study is evaluating tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP, as a front-line treatment for patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and is being sponsored by LYSARC. We agreed in 2020 to expand the trial to also include an expansion cohort for the front-line treatment of high-risk patients with FL. The Phase 1b part of the study has completed, and we commenced a Phase 2 clinical expansion 
 15


trial in front-line treatment for high-risk patients with both FL and DLBCL. LYSA is managing the study operations for the trial, and we are recognizing our share of the related expenses as those costs are incurred over the duration of the trial. Primary endpoints in the trial include complete response rate, safety and tolerability of the combination.  Secondary endpoints include ORR and PFS. 
 
Boehringer Ingelheim
 In November 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim. As previously disclosed, Boehringer Ingelheim terminated the collaboration without cause, effective January 31, 2021. 
 Celgene
In April 2012, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement between the Company and Celgene International Sàrl and Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, which was subsequently amended by the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement between the Company and Celgene Corporation and Celgene RIVOT Ltd. in July 2015, or the Celgene Collaboration Agreement. As previously disclosed, the Celgene Collaboration Agreement was terminated by Celgene without cause, effective January 2, 2021.
Genentech 
 In June 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, to conduct a Phase 1b clinical trial to investigate the anti-cancer effects of our EZH2 inhibitor, tazemetostat, and Genentech’s anti-PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy, atezolizumab, when used in combination for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The trial has been completed and in November 2020 we received the final study report from Genentech. As a result, the collaboration agreement expired by its terms. There are no further payments due by either party to the other.
Companion Diagnostics 
 Roche  
 In December 2012, Eisai and we entered into a companion diagnostics agreement with Roche Molecular under which Eisai and we engaged Roche Molecular to develop a companion diagnostic to identify patients who possess certain activating mutations of EZH2. In October 2013, this agreement was amended to include additional mutations in EZH2. The development costs due under the amended agreement with Roche Molecular were the responsibility of Eisai until the execution of the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai in March 2015, at which time we assumed responsibility for the remaining development costs due under the agreement. In December 2015, we and Eisai entered into a second amendment to the companion diagnostics agreement with Roche Molecular. The agreement was further amended in March 2018. Under the amended agreement, we were responsible for remaining development costs of $10.4 million due under the agreement as of March 2018 and Eisai agreed to reimburse us $0.9 million of this amount related to a regulatory milestone for Japan. In July 2019, we entered into a fourth amendment to the companion diagnostics agreement. Under the amended agreement, we and Roche Molecular agreed to divide a $1.0 million regulatory milestone for the United States into two separate milestone payments, of which $0.5 million was paid by us as part of the signed amendment, and the remaining $0.5 million was paid by us in December 2019 upon the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the fourth amendment to the companion diagnostics agreement. As part of this fourth amendment, Roche Molecular also assigned all of its rights and obligations under the companion diagnostics agreement to Roche Sequencing Solutions, or RSS, effective as of January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we are responsible for the remaining development costs of $1.0 million due under the agreement. The $0.9 million that Eisai has agreed to reimburse us related to a regulatory milestone for Japan was achieved as of June 30, 2020 with payment received in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the Company paid $1.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 16


Under the agreement with RSS, RSS is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and to make commercially available the companion diagnostic kit. RSS has exclusive rights to commercialize the companion diagnostic kit developed pursuant to this agreement. On June 18, 2020 the FDA approved the companion diagnostic kit that is intended to identify FL patients with an EZH2 mutation for treatment with tazemetostat.
 The agreement with RSS will expire when we and Eisai are no longer developing or commercializing tazemetostat. We and Eisai may terminate the agreement by giving RSS 90 days’ written notice if we and Eisai discontinue development and commercialization of tazemetostat or determine, in conjunction with RSS, that the companion diagnostic is not needed for use with tazemetostat. Any party may also terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by any other party, in the event of material changes in circumstances that are contrary to key assumptions specified in the agreement or in the event of specified bankruptcy or similar circumstances. Under specified termination circumstances, RSS may become entitled to specified termination fees. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary compounds and technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technologies, diagnostics and other inventions. Our patent portfolio is currently composed of over 300 issued patents and allowed patent applications and over 550 pending patent applications in the major pharmaceutical markets, that we own as well as license from other parties. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of HMTs, as well as to develop a proprietary position for new target classes, such as HATs and helicases. 
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional CMP and HMT inhibitor compounds and their derivatives, and to other new target classes. Specifically, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds and the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies. 
 The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below. 
 EZH2. Our EZH2 patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent No. 8,410,088 covering the composition of matter of tazemetostat. This patent issued on April 2, 2013 and is expected to expire in 2032, not including extensions. Our EZH2 portfolio also includes 50 additional U.S. patents and more than 250 foreign patents, expected to expire between 2031 and 2036, not including extensions. The claims of these patents cover the composition of matter of EZH2 inhibitor compounds and various methods of their making and use. Patent applications in the same families as these patents are pending in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States. The EZH2 program portfolio encompasses more than 40 patent families with pending patent applications relating to compositions of matter and methods of making and use of EZH2 inhibitors. The patent families in this portfolio are in various stages of prosecution and include patent applications filed in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States; Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States, and at least one U.S. provisional application that may be used as the basis for non-provisional U.S. applications, PCT applications and other national filings worldwide. Our patent applications in the EZH2 portfolio, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2031 and 2041, not including extensions. 
 DOT1L. Our DOT1L patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent No. 8,580,762 covering the composition of matter of pinometostat. The patent issued on November 12, 2013 and is expected to expire in 2032, not including extensions. Our DOT1L portfolio also includes 16 additional U.S. patents and more than 45 foreign patents, expected to expire between 2031 and 2034, not including extensions. The DOT1L program portfolio encompasses more than fifteen 
 17


patent families relating to compositions of matter of DOT1L inhibitor compounds and methods of their making and use. The patent families in this portfolio are in various stages of prosecution and include patent families with applications filed in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions including the United States. These patents and patent applications are wholly owned by us. Our patent applications in the DOT1L portfolio, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2031 and 2035, not including extensions. 
 EHMT2. Our EHMT2 patent portfolio includes more than eight patent families directed to various product candidates and methods of use, with applications filed in the United States and internationally. Patents, if issued from currently pending applications in the EHMT2 portfolio, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2038, not including extensions.
 Other Targets. We also have patent portfolios directed to targets other than EZH2, DOT1L, and EHMT2, including the HMT targets PRMT1, PRMT3, CARM1 (also known as PRMT4), PRMT5, PRMT6, PRMT8, SMYD2 and SMYD3. These patent portfolios have more than 35 patent families directed to various product candidates with applications filed in the United States, PCT applications that are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States, and U.S. provisional applications that may be used to establish non-provisional U.S. applications, PCT applications and other national filings worldwide. Patents, if issued in these portfolios are expected to expire between 2033 and 2041. We have more than 20 granted U.S. patents that cover PRMT5 inhibitors and their methods of use. These patents are expected to expire in 2033, not including extensions. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
 In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We have applied for patent term extension on a patent that covers the TAZVERIK drug substance (tazemetostat) based on the regulatory review of TAZVERIK for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. In the future, if and when any additional pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities and currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our development-stage product candidates as well as our commercial products. We have entered into clinical and commercial supply agreements with contract manufacturers for the clinical development and commercialization of tazemetostat.
 18


Tazemetostat is a small molecule and is manufactured in third-party facilities that are equipped, staffed, and experienced in the manufacture of such pharmaceutical products. All such facilities have successful track-records manufacturing products for the United States, European Union, and rest of world markets, meeting regulatory and compliance requirements as appropriate. 
 We expect that any product candidates that we may develop will be small molecules that may be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.  
 We rely on third parties for the manufacture of any diagnostics we may need or if required and may continue to enter into similar agreements for the manufacture of other diagnostics. We are currently collaborating with RSS for a diagnostic for its use with tazemetostat. As described above, under the agreement with RSS, RSS is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and to make commercially available the companion diagnostic. In June 2020 the FDA approved the companion diagnostic that is intended to identify follicular lymphoma patients with an EZH2 mutation for treatment with tazemetostat. 
 Commercialization 
 TAZVERIK is available to eligible patients in the United States via a specialty distribution network. Through this specialty distribution network, we sell TAZVERIK principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacies, which dispense the product directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which in turn sell the product to hospital pharmacies and community practice pharmacies for the treatment of patients. To commercialize TAZVERIK for the ES and FL indications in the United States, we have built a focused field presence and marketing capabilities. This includes an efficiently sized field-based organization of approximately 76 individuals. 
 We are pursuing three strategic imperatives that we believe are integral to early success for TAZVERIK in the United States:
  
• | ensure eligible ES and FL patients have access to TAZVERIK by educating healthcare providers, patients and payers on the TAZVERIK data in approved indications,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensure that TAZVERIK becomes widely adopted by physicians as an essential treatment option for each labeled indication, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensure our company sponsored programs for patients and providers (EpizymeNOW) offer a positive experience when TAZVERIK is prescribed. EpizymeNOW has been facilitating patient access to new TAZVERIK prescriptions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Subject to receiving marketing approvals for additional indications or products, we expect to use our existing sales organization in the United States or to seek to expand our sales organization in the United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the hematologists and oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which tazemetostat is being developed and for which any future product candidates may be developed. Outside the United States, we may choose to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval, or may choose to commercialize our products in certain markets, depending upon many factors, including the target market size, availability of reimbursement, and our financial resources at the time. 
 We own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan. Eisai holds the rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan. For geographies outside the United States, we are evaluating the most efficient path to reaching patients, including through leveraging existing and identifying new strategic collaborations that can contribute to our ability to rapidly develop and commercialize tazemetostat outside of the United States.
 We expect that our collaborators for any companion or complementary diagnostics we may develop in the future for use with our therapeutic products will hold the commercial rights to these diagnostic products, as is the case for our collaboration with RSS. We expect to coordinate closely with any diagnostic collaborators in connection with the marketing and sale of any related therapeutic products.

Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 In the relapsed and refractory FL patient setting, both current and near-term competition exists. Current competition includes CD20 combinations, multiple PI3K inhibitors, and CAR T therapies, which are starting to be used. Near-term competition includes new PI3K inhibitors, CAR T therapies and bi-specific monoclonal antibodies, which are investigational agents with varying mechanisms of action, some of which have recently been granted special designations from the FDA. In the ES patient setting, competition includes several clinical trials run by competitors that recruit patients with soft tissue sarcoma, which is inclusive of ES.
 There are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Companies that are developing new epigenetic treatments for cancer that target histone methyltransferases, or HMTs, and protein arginine methyltransferases, or PRMTs, include GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, and Constellation Pharmaceuticals. Further, companies which are known to have EZH2 inhibitor programs or related programs include: Constellation Pharmaceuticals, developing an EZH2 inhibitor CPI-0209, Phase 1/2, advanced tumors (solid tumors and DLBCL), Novartis AG, developing an EED inhibitor which indirectly blocks EZH2 (MAK683, Phase 1/2, advanced malignancies), Daiichi Sankyo, developing a EZH1/EZH2 dual inhibitor (valemetostat, DS-3201, Phase 1, relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas, AML, ALL as well as Phase 2 for small cell lung cancer and relapsed or refractory adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma), and Pfizer, developing EZH2 inhibitor PF-06821497, Phase 1, relapsed or refractory SCLC, castration-resistant prostate cancer, FL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition, many companies are developing cancer therapeutics that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms other than HMTs, and some including Celgene (now part of Bristol-Myers Squibb), Merck & Co., Inc., Secura Bio, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, and Otsuka, are now marketing cancer treatments that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms other than HMTs. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.

The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. There are a number of products in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 Tazemetostat. The most common treatments for FL are chemotherapies, usually combined with the monoclonal antibody Rituxan, or Gazyva, which is an antibody that acts against the same target as Rituxan, CD20. While Rituxan and a number of other widely used anti-cancer agents are labeled broadly for follicular lymphoma, no therapies are approved specifically for the treatment of tumors associated with EZH2 activating mutations. There are a number of companies currently evaluating investigational agents in the relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma patient setting.
 In the relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma patient setting, both current and near term competition exists. Current competition includes CD20 combinations along with multiple PI3K inhibitors. Near term competition includes companies currently evaluating investigational agents with varying mechanisms of action. 
 Other than TAZVERIK, there are no therapies which have been approved specifically for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma. Epithelioid sarcoma, an INI1-negative tumor, is typically treated with surgical resection when it presents as localized disease. When epithelioid sarcoma recurs or metastasizes, it may be treated with systemic chemotherapy or investigational agents because, other than TAZVERIK, there are no approved systemic therapies specifically indicated for this disease. To the best of our knowledge there are no competitive products in development specifically for epithelioid sarcoma. However, we are aware of several clinical trials run by competitors that recruit patients with soft tissue sarcoma, which is inclusive of epithelioid sarcoma. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, record-keeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, pricing, reimbursement, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
United States Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. It is the responsibility of the company seeking to market a drug to test it and submit evidence that the drug is safe and effective. The failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | manufacture of drug substance and drug product to support clinical trials in compliance with FDA’s cGMP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


 
• | performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or sNDA;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites and/or clinical CROs to determine GCP compliance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the NDA sponsor to assess compliance with GxPs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees per published Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines for that year, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or sNDA; and
--+------------------------------------------------


• | commitment to comply with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirements, to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies and an IND. Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and effectiveness. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after submission and receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA either provides a “safe to proceed” letter, or raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold or partial hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing a clinical trial to commence. 
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated, if appropriate. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, often known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the candidate drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the investigational drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the candidate drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 
 22


product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In Phase 4, post-approval studies may be conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 In general, the FDA accepts foreign safety and efficacy studies that were not conducted under an IND provided that they are well designed, well conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conducted in accordance with ethical principles acceptable to the international community. The conduct of these studies must meet at least minimum standards for assuring human subject protection. Therefore, for studies submitted in support of an NDA that were conducted outside the United States and not under an IND, the agency requires demonstration that such studies were conducted in accordance with GCP. 
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use. 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies who do not otherwise qualify for an ongoing clinical trial. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.  Sponsors are required to make their expanded access policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition to and separate from expanded access, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
 23


Marketing Approval. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2021 is $2,875,842 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2021 is $336,432. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan drug designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The FDA maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. Congress amended the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA. Previously, drugs that had been granted orphan drug designation were exempt from the requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Under the amended section 505B, beginning on August 18, 2020, the submission of a pediatric assessment, waiver or deferral will be required for certain molecularly targeted cancer indications with the submission of an NDA application or supplement to an NDA application. FL qualifies for an automatic full pediatric waiver by the FDA because it rarely or never occurs in pediatric patients. 
 The FDA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, or other clinical development programs.
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 
 Under PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review and disposition of an application. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA has the option to refer questions regarding their review of a marketing application for a New Molecular Entity, or NME, to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA uses approximately 50 advisory committees and panels to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical, and policy matters. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 24


Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs, may inspect the clinical CRO(s) to assure compliance with GCPs, and may perform a sponsor inspection. 
 The product development testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. As a result, the FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan Drug Designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug (including a biologic) intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or biologics license application, or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives. For example, a marketing application for a prescription drug product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than for the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Also, orphan drug designation extends the marketing exclusivity period for new drugs for the approved orphan indication from 5 years to 7 years from the date of approval. Furthermore, federal law establishes certain tax credits designed to encourage the development of orphan drugs. With passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, that tax credit was halved from 50% to 25%. The granting of an orphan drug designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies.
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs. The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 25


Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” The FDA may grant breakthrough therapy designation to a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval. 
 Fast Track Designation. To be eligible for a Fast Track Designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA regarding drug development and may submit sections of a Fast Track product’s NDA on a rolling basis before the entire application is complete. 
 Priority Review. The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 Accelerated Approval. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of well-conducted clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to perform post-marketing confirmatory study(ies) to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoints, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. Although a drug may be designated as “breakthrough” or “fast track”, the determination of accelerated approval is based on the clinical endpoint and not on the expeditious manner in which it is being developed. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics. Safe and effective use of a drug may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to the treatment. FDA officials have issued guidance that addresses issues critical to developing in vitro companion diagnostics, such as when the FDA will require that the diagnostic and the drug be approved simultaneously. The guidance issued in August 2014 states that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. 
 The FDA generally requires that devices, or in vitro companion diagnostics, intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the drug. Based on the guidance, and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, the FDA will typically require PMA approval of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for these cancer therapies. 
 26


The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2021, the standard fee is $365,657 and the small business fee is $91,414.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
 Post-Approval Commitments and Requirements. Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability. If a company is found to have promoted off label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. 
 The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively PPACA, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. PPACA also created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, 
 28


created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 In addition, federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other health care providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures. 
 To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish corresponding reimbursement levels. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce 
 29


costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 
 Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, PPACA, which became law in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to potential product candidates are: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 30


 
• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. PPACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, pursuant to the CARES Act. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 became law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 These healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices or the frequency with which products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law.
 Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019.  Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax.  Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent 
 31


the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” The Congress may consider other legislation to replace elements of the PPACA during the next Congressional session.
 The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA. During his term, President Trump signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the PPACA. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to healthcare, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access.  Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the PPACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the PPACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s ruling that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is unconstitutional and it remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration of the severability question and additional analysis of the provisions of the PPACA.  Thereafter, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear this case. Oral argument in the case took place on November 10, 2020, and a ruling by the Court is expected sometime this year. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.  To those ends, President Trump issued five executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription drug products but it is unclear whether, and to what extent, these orders will remain in force under the Biden Administration.  Further, on September 24, 2020, the Trump Administration finalized a rulemaking allowing states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and approval. Applicants are required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers.  The FDA has issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).  
 
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.

Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension. A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Exclusivity. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA. 
 Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 A 505(b)(2) application applies to a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” As with an ANDA, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication. 
 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate patent infringement litigation in 
 33


response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 Hatch—Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity. Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
 The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitor generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application. 
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, a drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications. If a drug or biologic designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug exclusivity will also not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan drug exclusivity periods described above, and any listed patent. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent 
 34


protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any of our products is approved, we anticipate seeking pediatric exclusivity when it is appropriate.
 European Union Drug Approval Process 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Clinical Trial Approval in the EU. Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directives, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable to and binding in all 27 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Reference Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. 
 In January 2020, the website of the European Commission reported that the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation was dependent on the development of a fully functional clinical trials portal and database, which would be confirmed by an independent audit which was conducted in December 2020, and that the new legislation would come into effect six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of this confirmation. The Regulation becomes applicable six months after the European Commission publishes notice of this confirmation and has published an expected system “go live” in December 2021. When the Regulation becomes applicable, the existing EU Clinical Trial Directive and national legislation put in place to implement the Directive will be repealed. Following implementation of the EU Clinical Trials Regulation, a transitional period will be in effect for one year where new clinical trial applications can be submitted either under the existing EU Clinical Trials Directive or under the new Clinical Trials Regulation. It will also apply to trials authorized under the previous legislation if they are still ongoing three years after the Regulation has come into operation.
 As in the United States, information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the European Union (EudraCT) website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/ and other countries.
 Marketing Authorization. To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, and optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Scientific Advice Working Party 
 35


of the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease, such as heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one-member state, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. For the EMA, an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan, which could include a request for waiver or deferral, is required prior to submitting an MAA for use for drugs in pediatric populations. 
 Data and Market Exclusivity. In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from assessing a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete human clinical trial database and obtain marketing approval of its product. 
General Data Protection Regulation. The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity. The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free protocol assistance, fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedures before and during the first year after marketing authorization and 10 years of market exclusivity of the designated indication following drug approval. Fee 
 36


reductions are not limited to the first year after authorization for small and medium enterprises. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Priority Medicines, or PRIME, Drug Designation. EMA may grant PRIME drug designation to medicine developers to treat an unmet medical need upon selection. Medicines eligible for PRIME must address an unmet medical need, have data available showing the potential to address this need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients. PRIME designation provides early and enhanced support from EMA to optimize the development of eligible medicines, speeds up their evaluation, and contributes to timely patients’ access. Once a candidate is selected for PRIME designation, the EMA will provide scientific advice at key development milestones and confirm potential for accelerated assessment at the time of an application for marketing authorization. These medicines are considered priority medicines by EMA.  
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom. 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement, there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020 (extendable by up to two years). On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom.
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021.  This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the EU 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected.
