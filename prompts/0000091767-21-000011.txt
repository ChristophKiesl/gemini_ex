Item 1. Business
(a) General development of business –
Sonoco Products Company ("Sonoco," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a South Carolina corporation originally founded in Hartsville, South Carolina, in 1899 as the Southern Novelty Company. At its beginnings in 1899, a team of 12 people worked from a rented warehouse in Hartsville, South Carolina. The Company’s first product was a cone-shaped paper yarn carrier used for winding and transporting yarn. Since most of the textile cones of that day were wooden, paper cones were a novelty. The Company soon became the leading producer of cones in the United States. The Southern Novelty Company continued to diversify its product line and add new operations around the country. In 1923, the Southern Novelty Company name was changed to Sonoco Products Company, or "Sonoco," using the first two letters from each word of its original name.
Sonoco is now a multi-billion dollar global manufacturer of a variety of consumer, industrial and protective packaging products, and a provider of packaging services. The Company has approximately 320 locations in 34 countries, serving some of the world’s best-known brands in some 85 nations. Sonoco is committed to creating sustainable products, services and programs for our customers, employees and communities that support our corporate purpose: Better Packaging. Better Life. Our goal is to bring more to packaging than just the package by offering integrated packaging solutions that help define brand personalities, creating unique customer experiences, and enhancing the quality of products. We seek to help our customers solve their packaging challenges by connecting insights to innovation and developing customized solutions that are tailored to the customer’s goals and objectives.
The Company currently reports its financial results in four reportable segments – Consumer Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, Protective Solutions, and Display and Packaging. Information about products and services of these segments and the markets they serve is discussed below under “Description of business.”
Sonoco plans to change its financial reporting structure in 2021 to reflect the way it plans to manage its operations, evaluate performance and allocate resources going forward. Accordingly, the Company's financial results are expected to be reported in two reportable segments, Consumer Packaging and Industrial Paper Packaging, with its remaining businesses reported in an "All Other" group.The Protective Solutions and Display and Packaging segments are expected to be eliminated and most of their businesses included in All Other. Changes to the Consumer Packaging segment are expected to include moving the healthcare packaging and Industrial Plastics business units to All Other. The Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment is expected to be renamed Industrial Paper Packaging and its structure remain relatively unchanged except that the Company's fiber protective packaging business unit will be added from the former Protective Solutions segment. As a result, All Other is expected to include the Company’s healthcare, protective packaging, temperature-assured packaging, consumer and automotive molded foam, and Alloyd retail security businesses. All Other would also include the U.S. Display and Packaging business unit.

Other Aspects of the Company's Business
Product Distribution – Each of the Company’s operating units has its own sales staff, and maintains direct sales relationships with its customers. Some of the units have service staff at the manufacturing facility that interact directly with customers. The Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment and certain operations within the Consumer Packaging segment have customer service centers located in Hartsville, South Carolina, which are the main contact points between their North American business units and their customers. Divisional sales personnel also provide sales management, marketing and product development assistance as needed. Typically, product distribution is directly from the manufacturing plant to the customer, but in some cases, product is warehoused in a mutually advantageous location to be shipped to the customer as needed.
Raw Materials – The principal raw materials used by the Company are recovered paper, paperboard, steel, aluminum and plastic resins. Raw materials are purchased from a number of outside sources. The Company considers the supply and availability of raw materials to be adequate to meet its needs.
Patents, Trademarks and Related Contracts – Most inventions and product and process innovations are generated by Sonoco’s development, marketing and engineering staffs, and are important to the Company’s internal growth. Patents have been granted on many inventions created by Sonoco staff in the United States and in many other countries. Patents and trade secrets were acquired as part of several acquisitions over the past two years, including the acquisitions of Can Packaging, Thermoform Engineered Quality, LLC, and Plastique Holdings, LTD, (together "TEQ"), Corenso Holdings America, Inc. ("Corenso"), the remaining 70 percent interest in Conitex Sonoco (BVI), Ltd., and Highland Packaging Solutions. These patents are managed globally by a Sonoco intellectual capital management team through the Company’s subsidiary, Sonoco Development, Inc. (SDI). SDI globally manages patents, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and license agreements. Some patents have been licensed to other manufacturers. Sonoco also licenses a few patents from outside companies and universities. U.S. patents expire after about 20 years, and patents on new innovations replace many of the abandoned or expired patents. A second intellectual capital subsidiary of Sonoco, SPC Resources, Inc., globally manages Sonoco’s trademarks, service marks, copyrights and Internet domain names. Most of Sonoco’s products are marketed worldwide under trademarks such as Sonoco®, SmartSeal®, Sonotube®, Sealclick®, Sonopost® and UltraSeal®. Sonoco’s registered web domain names such as www.sonoco.com and www.sonotube.com provide information about Sonoco, its people and its products. Trademarks and domain names are licensed to outside companies where appropriate.
Seasonality – Although the Company’s operations are not seasonal to a significant degree, the Display and Packaging segment normally reports slightly higher sales and operating profits in the second half of the year, when compared to the first half and the Consumer Packaging segment's perimeter of store business recognizes higher sales in the first half of the year ahead of and during the harvest season for fresh fruit and vegetables. The Company did not experience normal seasonality trends during 2020 due to the impacts of the economic disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Dependence on Customers – On an aggregate basis during 2020, the five largest customers in the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment, the Consumer Packaging segment and the Protective Solutions segment accounted for approximately 8%, 25% and 27%, respectively, of each segment’s net sales. The dependence on a few customers in the Display and Packaging segment is more significant, as the five largest customers in this segment accounted for approximately 55% of its sales.
Sales to the Company’s largest customer represented 4.2% of consolidated revenues in 2020. This concentration of sales volume resulted in a corresponding concentration of credit, representing approximately 3% of the Company’s consolidated trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2020. The Company’s next largest customer comprised 3.8% of consolidated revenues in 2020.
Competition – The Company sells its products in highly competitive markets, which include paper, textile, film, food, chemical, packaging, construction, and wire and cable. All of these markets are influenced by the overall rate of economic activity and their behavior is principally driven by supply and demand. Because we operate in highly competitive markets, we regularly bid for new and continuing business. Losses and/or awards of business from our largest customers, customer changes to alternative forms of packaging, and the repricing of business, can have a significant effect on our operating results. The Company manufactures and sells many of its products globally. The Company, having operated 
5 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 


internationally since 1923, considers its ability to serve its customers worldwide in a timely and consistent manner a competitive advantage. The Company also believes that its technological leadership, reputation for quality, and vertical integration are competitive advantages. Expansion of the Company’s product lines and global presence is driven by the rapidly changing needs of its major customers, who demand high-quality, state-of-the-art, environmentally compatible packaging, wherever they choose to do business. It is important to be a low-cost producer in order to compete effectively. The Company is constantly focused on productivity improvements and other cost-reduction initiatives utilizing the latest in technology.
Compliance with Government Regulations and Laws – The Company must comply with extensive laws, rules and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries where it conducts business with respect to a variety of matters. Management believes that the Company is in compliance with all material applicable government regulations, including environmental regulations and does not believe that there is any material impact on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of efforts to comply with these regulations. Information regarding compliance with government regulations, including environmental laws is provided in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption “Risk Management,” and in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital Management - Sonoco’s core belief that “we are only as strong as our people” underlies our efforts to attract, acquire and retain talented employees for our global businesses. We seek to engage, develop and reward our 20,000 employees so they can successfully pursue our purpose of Better Packaging. Better Life. We depend on our employees to achieve our mission of creating sustainable packaging solutions that help build our customers’ brands, enhance the quality of their products and improve the quality of life for people around the world. We work to accomplish this goal by establishing a foundation for actions that support health and safety, diversity and inclusion, and talent development.
Health and Safety – Protecting the health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and we are committed to providing a safe working environment for all our employees. In 2019, we implemented new safety initiatives to eliminate injuries leading to Life Changing Events (LCE). We use global and local incident data along with identifying leading indicators to create programs and safety action plans to reduce conditions and behaviors that lead to at-risk situations. In 2020, we experienced a 6% decline in total recordable injuries and lost days were down more than 40%. To promote further elimination of incidents, we have introduced standardized safety metrics and practices within each of our business units to help ensure that we are evaluating and directing safety similarly across all or our operations. In 2020, our safety training focused on energy isolation, safe electrical work practices, working at heights and making paper safely. We evaluated our safety systems in 2020 to improve focus and prioritization of resources, and globally, we achieved 97% of our Safety Action Plans, which are site level improvement plans designed to reduce risks.
Our focus on safeguarding the health of our employees was strengthened in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic. We have implemented new safety protocols and procedures across all our facilities following recommendations by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. We established a global task force of senior leaders along with regional management committees to continuously monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our employees and proactively put in place new measures and practices for the health and safety of our employees and in response to applicable local laws or ordinances.
Diversity and Inclusion – Sonoco embraces Diversity and Inclusion, and our efforts to increase diversity within our Company are an organizational priority. We strive to translate our values and belief about people into an organization that reflects the diversity of our customers and the communities where we live and work. As of December 31, 2020, our employees were located in the following geographic regions: 48% in North America; 30% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; 12% in Latin America; and 10% in Asia Pacific. Our global workforce is 26% female and 74% male, and 34% of our U.S. employees identify with a racial minority. We have labor unions in all regions of our operations, and in North America, approximately 16% of our employees are represented by labor unions.
We rely on the unique qualities and talents of our employees to help us meet our strategic priorities. Our Diversity and Inclusion goals are focused on increasing representation of women and racial minority employees into more salaried and senior leadership positions. We are working toward this goal by increasing hiring and promotions rates as well as decreasing attrition. In 2011, Sonoco’s employees formed our Global Diversity and Inclusion Council. In 2019, we completed a review and refresh of council activities to focus on workforce representation (diversity) and work environment (inclusion) by addressing unconscious bias to ensure we are building an environment where diverse backgrounds are appreciated, and diverse ideas are heard.
In addition, we are committed to lifting-up historically disadvantaged businesses in an effort to make a positive economic impact on society. We have had a dedicated Supplier Diversity program since 2004, and since 2010 we have spent more than $1.5 billion with diverse suppliers. In 2020, our diversity spend was approximately 9.8% of our total supplier spend in the U.S. and Canada. We were recently nominated for the 2020 Corporation of the Year by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), awarded to recognize the best in minority business inclusion practices and utilization. 
Talent Acquisition and Development – Attracting, developing, and retaining talented employees is critical to our success and is an integral part of our human capital management strategy. We have created a Global Talent Acquisition and Organizational Development team to provide a more holistic approach to managing and enriching the employee lifecycle through continuous training and comprehensive succession planning. In 2020, we developed and opened Sonoco University, a centralized digital training hub, to provide our employees with expanded learning and career development programs. In addition, we conduct regular talent succession assessments along with individual performance reviews in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to assist with the development of our employees, including the use of individual development plans to assist with individual career development.
