Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a precision medicine approach to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapeutic and companion diagnostic products for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, starting first with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We leverage our proprietary precision medicine platform, Prometheus360™, which includes one of the world’s largest gastrointestinal (GI) bioinformatics database and sample biobank, to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop therapeutic candidates to engage those targets. In parallel, we are developing companion diagnostic tests designed to identify patients more likely to respond to our therapeutic candidates. We have generated a robust pipeline of therapeutic development programs for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases.
 
Our lead product candidate, PRA023, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has been shown to block tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A), a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis that was clinically validated in Pfizer’s Phase 2a clinical trial in ulcerative colitis (UC). PRA023 has the potential to substantially improve outcomes for moderate-to-severe IBD patients, especially those predisposed to increased TL1A expression.
 
In 2021, we completed our Phase 1 clinical trial of PRA023 in normal healthy volunteers and advanced PRA023 into a Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe UC and an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease (CD), each utilizing our genetics-based companion diagnostic candidate designed to classify patients who are predisposed to increased expression of TL1A and therefore potentially more likely to respond to PRA023. We are currently enrolling patients in these clinical trials of PRA023 for UC and CD and expect to provide topline results from both of these clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 
PRA023’s dual mechanism of action, targeting both inflammation and fibrosis, provides strong support for investigating the potential applicability of TL1A modification in areas outside IBD including indications in dermatology, pulmonary or hepatobiliary disease. In December 2021, we announced our plans to expand our pipeline beyond IBD into other immune-mediated diseases and plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for PRA023 in Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD) by the end of the first quarter of 2022. In January 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted fast track designation for PRA023 for the treatment of SSc-ILD. We will continue to explore additional potential indications for PRA023.
 Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
 IBD is a complex disease with many contributing factors, including genetic, environmental and immunologic. UC and CD are two of the most common forms of IBD. Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the GI tract that begin most commonly during adolescence and young adulthood. UC involves the innermost lining of the large intestine, and symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, frequently with blood and mucus. CD can affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall and all parts of the GI tract from mouth to anus. CD symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other more systemic symptoms such as weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and fever. 
 Current therapies used for the treatment of UC and CD apply a one-size-fits-all approach without regard to biologic variations amongst patients, and substantial unmet need remains. The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe IBD is typically anti-inflammatory agents; however, none of these therapies address fibrosis, or scarring, in IBD. The majority of IBD patients do not respond to first-line anti-TNF agents. Since the approval of the first anti-TNF agent for the treatment of CD in 1998, the availability of JAK inhibitors and newer biological agents, including anti-integrin and anti-IL12/23, has improved the care of moderate-to-severe IBD (JAK inhibitors in UC only). However, these subsequently approved therapies have generally failed to demonstrate a clinical remission effect size of more than 15% relative to placebo. Moreover, among those patients who do respond to therapy, up to 45% will lose response over time. Likewise, therapies under development have not demonstrated improved remission rates over previously approved therapies. In addition, in late 2021, the FDA issued a black box warning to the JAK drug class with indication for the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, based on an increased risk of serious heart-related events such as heart attack or stroke, cancer, blood clots, and death. 
 IBD is estimated to affect over 2,000,000 people in the United States and over 5,000,000 people globally. The IBD market was approximately $12.5 billion in the United States and $18.4 billion globally in 2019 and is expected to grow to approximately $14.2 billion in the United States and $21.4 billion globally by 2024. Based in part on patient cohort data for our companion diagnostic product candidate, we estimate this product candidate will identify an increased level of TLIA expression in over 30% of IBD patients. The IBD market is highly concentrated, with four therapeutic products accounting for 75% of global revenues.

Our Precision Medicine Approach 
 Precision medicine involves the discovery and development of therapies that integrate clinical and molecular information based on the biological basis of disease to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. We are pioneering the application of precision medicine in IBD and other immune-mediated diseases because we believe that by leveraging Prometheus360 we can identify novel therapeutic targets impacting the underlying pathways involved in IBD and the patient subgroups that will be responsive to a particular therapy and then explore the utility of these therapies in other immune-mediated diseases where the same pathways are implicated. 
 
We believe we have the potential to transform the entire IBD pharmaceutical value chain from discovery to commercialization with our precision medicine approach. Our Prometheus360 platform includes our extensive clinical database and associated biobank, which is one of the world’s largest collections of biospecimens from patients suffering from IBD and other GI disorders. This database and biobank, which we exclusively license from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Cedars-Sinai), includes more than 200,000 samples linked to extensive clinical data from over 20,000 patients collected over more than 20 years. This, in combination with our state-of-the-art machine-learning methodologies, make Prometheus360 a discovery engine for novel precision therapeutics and companion diagnostics. 
 
IBD clinical development programs can take up to seven to ten years to complete and physicians are often challenged with the task of enrolling patients from a limited pool of qualified candidates into a large number of trials with undifferentiated mechanisms of action. By using companion diagnostics to target a specific subset of the IBD population, we expect to reduce overall development time and cost through smaller trials and faster enrollment rates. We believe our precision medicine approach will result in a greater likelihood of identifying and developing the right drug for the right patient, help to maximize patient and trial outcomes, improve label claims, accelerate adoption of targeted therapeutics for addressable patients and provide attractive treatment options from a cost-benefit perspective for payors. 
 Our Portfolio 
 We have a robust pipeline of clinical-stage product candidates and other preclinical therapeutic development programs to address several clinical IBD patient subpopulations and plan to develop a companion diagnostic for each program. The following table summarizes our key current internal and partnered programs. 

PRA023 Overview—anti-TL1A mAb 
 Our lead product candidate, PRA023, is a humanized IgG1 mAb that has been shown to bind and neutralize both the active trimeric form and inactive monomeric form of TL1A. Third-party antibody programs against this target have been shown to reduce both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis in preclinical studies. The TL1A target has been clinically validated in that Pfizer’s Phase 2a 14-week open-label study in patients with moderate-to-severe UC observed a high proportion of patients (38%) achieving endoscopic improvement and 24% of patients achieved clinical remission. PRA023 binds both soluble and membrane-associated human TL1A with high affinity and specificity and has the potential to substantially improve outcomes for moderate-to-severe IBD patients predisposed to increased TL1A expression.

We are developing PRA023 for the treatment of UC, CD and SSc-ILD. In 2021, we completed the dosing and follow-up phase of a Phase 1 trial in normal healthy volunteers and initiated a Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of PRA023 in patients with moderate-to-severe UC and an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe CD, each utilizing a genetic-based companion diagnostic candidate designed to classify patients who are predisposed to increased expression of TL1A. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for PRA023 in SSc-ILD in the first quarter of 2022, which will also assess the performance of our companion diagnostic.
 
PR600 Overview—anti-TNF Super Family Member mAb 
 Our PR600 program targets a member of the TNF super family implicated in the function of memory T cells and T follicular helper cells in immune-mediated diseases. This target, expressed by immune cells, drives downstream biological pathways distinct from those activated by TNF or TL1A. It has been shown that blocking this target inhibits disease in multiple IBD animal models. We believe that a therapeutic developed against this target has the potential to impede both the reactivation and propagation of the pathogenic immune response in IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases. We have identified multiple genetic variants linked to patient subpopulations with a complicated course of disease. We have conducted functional genetic studies in patient samples and have identified genetic variations associated with an increase in target expressing immune cells in CD peripheral blood and an increased capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines. We intend to leverage Prometheus360 in combination with functional assays to identify patients with these genetic variants. 
 In 2020, we entered into a co-development and manufacturing agreement (the Falk Agreement) with Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH (Falk) for our PR600 program, in order to leverage Falk’s experience in GI drug development and commercialization in Europe. Under this agreement, we granted to Falk exclusive commercialization rights in Europe, Australia and New Zealand for PR600 and its companion diagnostic, while we retained commercialization rights in the United States and the rest of the world. In 2021, we earned both preclinical milestone payments from Falk related to our selection of a clinical candidate and our development of a companion diagnostic test for the PR600 program. We expect to submit an IND for our PR600 therapeutic candidate in the third quarter of 2022. 
 PR300 Overview—GPCR Modulator Small Molecule 
 Our PR300 program targets an orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed predominantly in the GI tract that we believe has important functions underlying intestinal epithelial integrity and innate immune cell function. We have identified a coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene of this target that represents a strong genetic association with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases. 
 PR1100 Overview—Anti-cytokine receptor mAb
 Our PR1100 program targets the receptor for a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been linked to multiple immune-mediated diseases. In particular, the pathway modulated by our target has been associated, both functionally, and genetically with IBD, highlighting a possible role in the pathogenesis of this disease. We have identified SNPs in the gene locus of this target that are associated with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases.
 PR1800 Overview—anti-Chemokine mAb
 Our PR1800 program targets a chemo-attractant factor which contributes to the local accumulation of a defined inflammatory effector cell population in the GI tract. Factors secreted by these effector cells are believed to deteriorate the structure and protective functions of the intestinal mucosal barrier. We have identified SNPs in the gene locus of this target that are associated with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases.
 PR2100 Overview—anti-Inflammatory Cytokine mAb 
 Our PR2100 program targets a cytokine implicated in a range of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. In IBD specifically, this cytokine has been implicated to contribute to non-response to anti-TNF therapies. We have identified SNPs in the gene locus of this target that are associated with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases. 
 Other Development Programs 
 We continue to evaluate numerous other drug targets identified through Prometheus360 for therapeutic utility for potential drug discovery development. In addition, we have a strategic collaboration with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda), relating to our development a companion diagnostic for one or more therapeutic candidates developed by Takeda for the treatment of UC and CD.

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to revolutionize the treatment of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases with a precision medicine approach for patients with significant unmet medical needs. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are: 

• | Maximize the value of our Prometheus360 precision medicine platform. Prometheus360 serves as our target, drug and companion diagnostic discovery and development engine. We have generated a robust pipeline of therapeutic development programs for the treatment of IBD in a capital and time efficient manner and plan to design and develop companion diagnostics to pair with each therapeutic candidate. We intend to expand into other immune-mediated diseases beyond IBD as warranted by the mechanism of action of the target.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance PRA023 through clinical trials in UC and CD and utilize our companion diagnostic to identify patients expected to benefit from treatment. PRA023 targets the TL1A pathway and has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life of patients suffering from IBD by targeting both inflammation and fibrosis. We expect to be able to identify patients who may specifically benefit from PRA023 by developing our TL1A companion diagnostic candidate in parallel with our therapeutic program. After observing favorable safety and tolerability results in the Phase 1 trial, in July 2021 we initiated a Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe UC and an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. Both trials are currently enrolling patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Explore additional indications for PRA023 starting with SSC-ILD. In December 2021, we announced our plans to initiate a Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients suffering from SSc-ILD. Because PRA023 targets both inflammation and fibrosis, additional indications in dermatology, pulmonary or hepatobiliary disease, for example, may also benefit from therapeutic modulation of TL1A. We plan to continue to investigate the use of PRA023 in additional indications outside of IBD and SSc-ILD to fully explore its potential.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• • | Advance our pipeline programs, including PR600, into and through the clinic. We have a robust pipeline of additional programs for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including PR600, which we believe can address additional unmet medical need. By utilizing Prometheus360, we are developing a companion diagnostic for PR600 which we believe will enable us to classify subsets of IBD patients who will differentially benefit from PR600. We intend to submit an IND for the PR600 program in the third quarter of 2022 and progress other pre-clinical programs towards the clinic. Utilize Enroll360 to help accelerate companion diagnostic driven clinical trials for PRA023 and other programs. We are building a global network of trial-ready sites where over 5,000 patients will be molecularly profiled and clinically characterized to determine their eligibility for our future biomarker-guided clinical trials including those for PRA023. Enroll360 is designed to accelerate our development timelines by improving the efficiency of patient identification and increasing the rate of enrollment for our biomarker-guided clinical trials.

Limitations of Current IBD Drug Development 
 Despite the increasing global burden of IBD, the lack of evolution and innovation in drug development has left many patients with suboptimal responses to existing therapies. While there are many programs and mechanisms of action in development for IBD, nearly all are primarily focused on inflammation, and multiple programs are pursuing the same well-established targets and pathways. The quantitative efficacy of approved treatments and therapies in development has remained stagnant since the approval of the first anti-TNF antibody for use in IBD. Given the large number of therapies in clinical development and the undifferentiated landscape, there is intense competition for the limited pool of patients eligible for clinical trials, leading to very slow recruitment. As a consequence of the slow recruitment rate and the large studies required due to small treatment effect, clinical development in IBD has become costly and slow. We believe our ability to select patients with a higher probability of response to a specific therapy will enable smaller, faster, and less costly studies and allow for targeted recruitment in this crowded IBD development landscape. 
 Given the heterogeneous nature of IBD, there is a growing need for the development of predictive biomarkers and companion diagnostics that can be used to identify those patients more likely to benefit from a specific therapeutic. Although there are product candidates with predictive biomarkers in development for IBD, there is no therapy approved with a companion diagnostic that predicts whether an IBD patient will respond to a specific therapeutic. 
 Attempts to identify new, targeted therapeutics for IBD through the use of publicly available clinical datasets have been hampered by the significant challenges associated with generating high-volume and high-quality data in a standardized manner from these datasets. Furthermore, while post-hoc analysis of clinical trial data can be helpful to retrospectively understand patient responses to particular therapeutics, the ability to use these data for understanding pathway pathogenesis in IBD or target discovery for IBD is limited.

Our Prometheus360TM Precision Medicine Platform 
 We deploy the following three main components of Prometheus360 to stratify the overall, heterogeneous IBD patient population into biologically homogeneous subgroups: (1) our comprehensive clinical data; (2) our large collection of biospecimens; and (3) our advanced data analytics capabilities. We believe this allows us to identify novel drug targets which can be used to develop product candidates designed to be effective in the specific IBD patient subpopulations we have identified as well in other immune-mediated diseases where the same pathway is implicated.
 Prometheus360 includes our extensive clinical database and associated biobank, which is one of the world’s largest collections of biospecimens from patients suffering from IBD and other GI disorders. This database and biobank, which we exclusively license from Cedars-Sinai, includes more than 200,000 samples linked to extensive clinical data from over 20,000 patients collected and curated over more than 20 years. Clinical data sources included in Prometheus360 include electronic medical records, imaging data, clinical chemistry, pathology records and serologies. As such, clinical history, response to therapies and longitudinal data are available to us for analysis. In addition to clinical data, we have access to relevant, well-annotated patient samples for translational validation of therapeutic targets to help guide therapeutic development. Stored biorepository patient samples available to us include tissue biopsies (either from endoscopy or from surgery), serum/plasma, DNA, RNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC), immortalized patient-derived B cells, stool and mesenteric adipose tissue. For many patients, we have multiple types of samples collected over multiple years. Samples from Prometheus360 are routinely interrogated by deep molecular profiling including SNP genotyping, whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, metabolomics and microbiomics. In addition to this large, well-annotated IBD cohort of data and biosamples, Prometheus360 also contains samples derived from independent cohorts and samples, such as samples collected from healthy relatives of patients, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in the discovery and development of our novel drug targets, therapeutic candidates, and companion diagnostics. 
 Prometheus360 relies on advanced datamining and bio-analytical capabilities that we employ to uncover insights about immunological pathways that drive IBD and other immune-mediated diseases, while providing a holistic view of the biology surrounding potential targets. We apply machine-learning algorithms to our clinical data and molecular profiling data to reveal disease-related trends, patterns and associations that are more reflective of what happens at a molecular level in complex immune-mediated diseases. Unlike traditionally employed strategies such as relying on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) alone, our bioinformatics approach allows us to discover and examine the joint effects of multiple genetic variants working in concert in key inflammatory pathways that contribute to the development and progression of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. As a consequence, our approach allows us to create complex algorithm-based and proprietary companion diagnostic products that we use to identify patients likely to benefit from our product candidates. 
 
Our Enroll360™ Precision Enrollment Platform 
 
In 2021, we launched Enroll360, a global patient enrollment platform designed to accelerate our development timelines by improving the efficiency of patient identification and increasing the rate of enrollment for our biomarker-guided clinical trials. We are building a global network of trial-ready sites where over 5,000 patients will be molecularly profiled and clinically characterized to determine their eligibility for our future biomarker-guided clinical trials. We have enrolled and profiled over 2,000 patients into our Enroll360 platform. We believe we can significantly reduce development time and cost by recruiting the right patients into the right clinical trials, based on their genetic profiles.
Advantages of Our Precision Approach
 We believe that together, Prometheus360 and Enroll360 can potentially revolutionize the drug development and treatment paradigm for patients by identifying patients more likely to respond favorably to treatment. We believe our platform has several key advantages, including: 

• | Potential to offer improved patient outcomes. IBD treatments approved and in development are largely undifferentiated and primarily target inflammation, resulting in a suboptimal clinical remission rate. We believe the ability to combine new mechanisms of action discovered through our Prometheus360 platform and a novel patient selection approach utilizing companion diagnostics will allow for better patient outcomes. To realize this advantage, we are developing precision therapeutic candidates in parallel with companion diagnostic candidates to address multiple targets and pathways in IBD and other-immune mediated diseases.

• | Reduced trial costs and development timelines. IBD clinical development programs can take up to seven to ten years to complete and physicians are often challenged with the task of enrolling patients from a limited pool of eligible candidates into a large number of trials with undifferentiated mechanisms of action. Prometheus360 has the potential to significantly reduce development time and cost by allowing for the design of smaller clinical trials through the targeting of pre-identified patients more likely to respond to a therapeutic candidate. We believe that Enroll360 will enable us to accelerate our clinical development timelines by improving the efficiency of patient identification and increasing the rate of enrollment for our biomarker-guided clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to drive physician and payor adoption of our therapeutic product candidates. Our platform and approach will potentially offer physicians the ability to prescribe more tailored treatments to each individual, which we believe will lead to improved patient outcomes and help drive physician adoption of our therapeutic product candidates. In addition, we believe our approach will be attractive to payors seeking to maximize overall cost-benefit and enhance our ability to more rapidly and effectively obtain favorable payor coverage for any approved product we develop.

IBD and Market Opportunity Overview
 IBD is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory disease of the GI tract. It is a complex disease with many contributing factors, including genetic, environmental and immunologic. IBD typically onsets during adolescence and young adulthood and is diagnosed based on clinical, laboratory, endoscopy and histopathology and/or imaging findings. The IBD market was approximately $12.5 billion in the United States and $18.4 billion globally in 2019 and is expected to grow to approximately $14.2 billion in the United States and $21.4 billion globally by 2024. 
 UC and CD are the two most common types of IBD. UC causes long-lasting inflammation and ulcers in the digestive tract and affects the innermost lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. UC is debilitating and can lead to life-threatening complications. There are no treatments that cure UC and patients often require life-long treatment. Symptoms include diarrhea, bloody stools, abdominal pain and cramping, urgency to defecate, inability to defecate despite urgency, weight loss, fatigue, and fever. Chronic inflammation associated with UC puts a patient at increased risk of developing colon cancer. UC affects an estimated 926,000 people in the United States and 2,750,000 people globally. The UC market was approximately $4.2 billion in the United States and $6.2 billion globally in 2019 and is expected to grow to approximately $5.4 billion in the United States and $8.3 billion globally by 2024. 
 CD also causes long-lasting inflammation and ulcers in the digestive tract. It differs from UC in that it affects the entire thickness of the bowel wall and all parts of the digestive tract from mouth to anus. There are no treatments that cure the disease and patients often require life-long treatment. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, fatigue, abdominal pain and cramping, bloody stools, mouth sores, reduced appetite and weight loss, and pain or drainage near or around the anus due to development of fistula from the inflammation. CD affects an estimated 1,157,000 people in the United States, and 2,446,000 people globally. The development of abnormal narrowing of the digestive tract, known as stricture, is common and is the leading indication requiring surgical intervention. Up to 70% of CD patients develop a stricturing or perforating complication, and the use of anti-inflammatory agents over the past decade has not materially changed the rate of need for surgical resection due to stricturing disease. The CD market was approximately $8.4 billion in the United States and $12.2 billion globally in 2019 and is expected to grow to approximately $8.8 billion in the United States and $13.1 billion globally by 2024. 
 IBD Current Treatments and Limitations 
 Medical treatment of IBD is typically divided into two types of therapy: induction and maintenance. Induction therapy is used to reduce inflammation quickly (in three months or less) and maintenance therapy is used to sustain that reduction after three months. Patients with IBD are classified as mild, moderate or severe, based on the level of symptoms experienced, inflammatory biomarkers, and severity of disease on endoscopy. The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe IBD is typically anti-inflammatory agents. 
 Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) are used as a first-line therapy in mild-to-moderate UC. Corticosteroids are used primarily during induction therapy and are effective for reducing symptoms but not for mucosal healing. There are serious side effects with extended corticosteroid use, including lowered quality of life, bone loss, weight gain and cardiovascular complications. Because of these serious long-term safety concerns, corticosteroids are used primarily as a bridge to manage symptoms until immunomodulators or biologic agents become effective and enable mucosal healing. Oral immunosuppressants (e.g. azathioprine and 6-mercatopurine) have not been effective as induction agents and are generally used for steroid-sparing or as an adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity against biologic agents. Oral immunosuppressants are also associated with known toxicities such as drops in white blood cell counts and increased risk for infection.

Since the approval of the first anti-TNF agent for the treatment of CD in 1998, the availability of JAK inhibitors (in UC) and newer biological agents, including anti-integrin and anti-IL12/23, has improved the care of moderate-to-severe IBD, but these are all anti-inflammatory agents and have safety and tolerability concerns due to their systemic impact and resulting effects on the immune system outside of the GI tract. In particular, in late 2021, the FDA issued a black box warning to the JAK inhibitor drug class with indication for the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, based on an increased risk of serious heart-related events such as heart attack or stroke, cancer, blood clots, and death.
 More importantly, these subsequently approved therapies have generally failed to demonstrate a clinical remission effect size of more than 15% relative to placebo. Moreover, among those patients who do respond to therapy, up to 45% will lose response over time. As a consequence, despite the advances in approved therapies over the past two decades, more than 15% of UC and 50% of CD patients require surgery within 10 years of diagnosis. The most common cause of surgery in UC is progressive disease not responsive to medical therapy and in CD it is development of strictures and/or perforation, requiring surgical resection of the intestine. The only novel mechanism of action that is currently in late stage clinical development is oral S1P modulators, which are also anti-inflammatory agents. 
 While fibrosis and stricturing are common in CD, clinically observable colonic strictures have also been reported in up to 11% of patients with UC, and we believe microscopic submucosal fibrosis is actually much more prevalent in UC patients than reported. In a study that examined 89 consecutive UC colectomy specimens from Cleveland Clinic, submucosal fibrosis was detected in 100% of the specimens. Microscopic evidence of fibrosis in the colonic wall may have significant clinical implications such as motility abnormalities leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, urgency and incontinence. It has long been speculated that intestinal fibrosis may be the underlying cause of persistent UC symptoms, after the resolution of inflammation, that is commonly misclassified as irritable bowel syndrome. 
 Current treatment of IBD applies a one-size-fits-all approach without regard to genetic or biological variations in patients. We believe there must be a paradigm shift towards developing specific therapies for patients whose disease is driven by a specific biology. To date, we believe there are no clinical stage programs focused on integrating precision therapeutics with companion diagnostics to overcome the limitations of a one-size-fits-all treatment approach for IBD. Additionally, despite the advances in anti-inflammatory therapeutics for the treatment of UC and CD over the past two decades, fibrosis in these patients has largely not been addressed by therapy, representing an area of high unmet need. There is currently no therapy approved or under development that directly targets the reversal of fibrosis in IBD. 
 Our Solutions for the Treatment of IBD 
 PRA023 (anti-TL1A mAb) + Companion Diagnostic 
 Utilizing our precision medicine approach, we have developed our lead product candidate, PRA023, which is an investigational, humanized IgG1 mAb that has been shown to block TL1A. Third-party antibody programs against this target have been shown to reduce both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis in preclinical studies, and this target has been clinically validated in Pfizer’s Phase 2a clinical trial in UC. PRA023 binds both soluble and membrane-associated human TL1A with high affinity and specificity and has the potential to substantially improve outcomes for moderate-to-severe IBD patients predisposed to increased TL1A expression. We are developing PRA023 for the treatment of UC and CD as lead indications. 
 In December 2021, we announced topline results from our Phase 1 clinical trial for PRA023, a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PRA023 in normal healthy volunteers and observed that PRA023 was well-tolerated, with no safety signal identified during the study. In July 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of PRA023 in patients with moderate-to-severe UC (ARTEMIS-UC) and an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe CD (APOLLO-CD), each utilizing our genetic-based companion diagnostic candidate designed to classify patients who are predisposed to increased expression of TL1A and therefore potentially more likely to respond to PRA023. We believe this approach will lead to reduced development costs and timelines, and ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. 
 
TL1A as an IBD drug target—potential to address not only inflammation but also fibrosis 

8



Much of the early research and development on anti-TL1A therapy has focused on the effect of the TL1A-DR3 pathway on inflammation. However, the potential for TL1A as a therapeutic target in intestinal fibrosis was demonstrated in a study conducted by Cedars-Sinai evaluating the effect of anti-TL1A antibodies in mouse models of IBD. In these studies, the authors used two mouse models of chronic colitis: adoptive T cell transfer and chronic DSS. In both models, a neutralizing TL1A mAb or an isotype control Ab was administered two times per week in mice (T cell transfer n=14; DSS n=28) with an established colitis. In both disease models, treatment with the TL1A mAb led to statistically significant reduction in colonic collagen deposition levels compared to mice that received the isotype control Ab (p<0.01), suggesting that blocking TL1A signaling not only prevented progression of colonic fibrosis, but also reversed established fibrosis to similar levels measured prior to the onset of inflammation. Furthermore, a third-party experiment conducted in mice overexpressing TL1A demonstrated that TL1A not only amplified the inflammatory and fibrotic response of the animals in well characterized models of IBD, but could also, on its own, induce spontaneous intestinal stricturing disease. We believe there is currently no anti-fibrotic therapy approved for CD, despite the fact that intestinal stricturing disease represents one of the greatest unmet needs for this disease. Thus, intestinal fibrosis mediated by increased levels of TL1A in the gut presents an area of high unmet medical need in IBD and differentiates the TL1A pathway mechanism of action from other approved therapies.
 In the description of the preclinical studies above and clinical trial below, a p-value represents the probability that random chance caused the result. For example, a p-value of 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance. A p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 is a commonly used threshold for identifying statistically significant outcomes. The FDA’s evidentiary standard of efficacy when evaluating the results of a clinical trial generally relies on a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05.
 TL1A—a clinically-validated drug target in UC 
 Pfizer’s TL1A compound (PF-06480605) was studied in a Phase 2a 14-week open-label study in 50 patients with moderate-to-severe UC, with inclusion criteria that did not select patients with companion diagnostic markers. Patients were dosed with 500 mg IV every other week. The study observed a high proportion of patients (38%) achieving endoscopic improvement (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 and without friability) with endoscopies read at an independent central reading center, statistically significant compared to a historical placebo rate of 6% in a pre-specified analysis (p < 0.001). In addition, 24% of subjects achieved clinical remission (defined as a total Mayo score £ 2 with no individual subscore > 1), statistically significant compared to the historical placebo rate (p < 0.0001). The Mayo score is used to assess disease activity in UC and measures stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic findings and physician global assessment. Lastly, substantial decreases in disease biomarkers (fecal calprotectin and high sensitivity c-reactive protein) were observed with early onset of action at weeks 2 to 4, a faster onset and response compared to the current standard of care. Treatment was generally well-tolerated. Serious adverse events were reported in three participants, one of which, alopecia (hair loss), was considered treatment-related. We believe these results clinically validate TL1A as a target in UC. 
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial of PRA023
 In December 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of PRA023 in normal healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 clinical trial was a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which normal healthy volunteers received IV administration of PRA023. The study enrolled 69 healthy volunteers with 6 cohorts of subjects in the single ascending dose (SAD) phase dosed up to 1000 mg and 3 cohorts of subjects in the multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase dosed up to 500 mg every other week for a total of three doses. We reported topline results from the Phase 1 study in December 2021.  
 The primary outcome measure was safety and tolerability over 14 weeks in the SAD and 18 weeks in the MAD.  PRA023 was well-tolerated, with 68 of the 69 patients completing all doses and the follow-up period. There were no apparent safety signals identified 
 9


during the study. There were no infusion reactions nor drug-related extension in infusion time at doses of up to 1000 mg delivered intravenously over 30 minutes. There were no clinically significant changes reported in physical exam, lab values, ECG or vital signs. All adverse events assessed as related to the study drug, including somnolence, headache, diarrhea and dizziness, were mild in severity and equally distributed between PRA023 and placebo treatment arms. There were no related adverse events reported in the highest dose group of 500 mg every other week.
 The Phase 1 study also evaluated the secondary outcome measures of pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity. Dose-proportional exposure was observed at doses of ≥ 100 mg. PRA023 demonstrated a half-life of approximately 19 days after administration of 500 mg every other week. We believe the PK profile observed in this study supports the dosing regimen selected for the currently ongoing Phase 2 UC and Phase 2a CD studies. Figures below show the geometric mean serum PRA023 concentration-to-time profile following single dose and multiple doses of PRA023 Q2W administration (on Days 1, 15, and 29) as IV infusion.
 

One of the secondary outcomes for the trial was the rate of immunogenicity associated with PRA023 after single and multiple doses, measured up to 14 and 18 weeks. The observed immunogenicity rate overall was 65% during the SAD and MAD phases of the study. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were observed to be associated with low doses and only when PRA023 drug concentration was low; specifically, there were no observations of ADA at PRA023 drug concentration greater than 29 µg/mL. ADAs did not have any apparent impact on safety outcomes, pharmacokinetics parameters, and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters. Less than 20% of subjects who received clinically relevant doses of PRA023 (1,000 mg for SAD cohort and 200 mg to 500 mg for MAD cohort) developed ADAs through the prolonged follow up period and only in 1 out of 17 subjects (6%) across the clinically relevant dose groups developed neutralizing antibodies.
 
The Phase 1 study also evaluated target engagement by PRA023 by measuring the total TL1A level in the serum. PRA023 binds to both the active trimeric form of TLIA and the inactive monomeric form of TL1A. The Phase 1 data demonstrated that target engagement by PRA023 was more than 4-times higher than would otherwise be expected if PRA023 only bound to trimeric TL1A. We believe that neutralization of both forms of TL1A will lead to increased target engagement and thereby to potentially more effective reduction of active TL1A in the disease tissue. Figures below show the median serum TL1A concentration (semi-log scale) following single dose and multiple dose of PRA023 Q2W administration (on Days 1, 15, and 29) as IV infusion.

Our Companion Diagnostic Product Candidate for PRA023 
 TL1A was one of the first targets shown by GWAS to be genetically associated with risk of developing IBD in a diverse patient population. Peripheral blood cells from patients carrying the TNFSF15 polymorphism risk SNPs produce higher levels of TL1A than those without the risk-associated polymorphism, suggesting this polymorphism may provide a means to identify patients with TL1A-driven disease and who are thus more likely to respond to anti-TL1A therapy. We are developing a patented genetic-based, multi-SNP polymerase chain reaction assay as a companion diagnostic for PRA023 and we expect to submit an investigational device exemption (IDE) application for our companion diagnostic candidate in the second half of 2022.
 In establishing our multi-SNP genomic biomarker set, we utilized machine-learning algorithms that, in contrast to traditional GWAS methodologies, allow us to take into account complex, non-linear genomic interactions that drive complex disequilibrium such as IBD. Our approach prioritizes SNP combinations that correlate with high TL1A pathway activity and risks, as opposed to merely capturing all patients with an observed set of symptoms. We have tested our companion diagnostic product candidate in over 400 IBD patients recruited from both academic and IBD community centers and have identified over 30% of these patients as having an increased propensity for TL1A expression with a positive predictive value of over 85%. A positive predictive value is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test actually have increased TL1A expression in selected functional assays. 
 
Formulation Development for PRA023
 
In December 2021, alongside our Phase 1 results, we announced that the company had achieved a subcutaneous formulation of 200 mg/ml for PRA023. We plan to conduct bridging studies of the IV formulation currently used in our Phase 2 clinical trials to the 200 mg/ml subcutaneous formulation in an autoinjector device. We believe that our development timeline supports the use of an autoinjector from the beginning of potential future registrational studies of PRA023.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials of PRA023
 
In July 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of PRA023 in patients with moderate-to-severe UC (ARTEMIS-UC) and an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe CD (APOLLO-CD), each utilizing our genetics-based companion diagnostic test designed to classify patients who are predisposed to increased expression of TL1A. Both studies are continuing to enroll patients.
ARTEMIS-UC: Phase 2 Clinical Trial of PRA023 in Ulcerative Colitis
 
Our ARTEMIS-UC Phase 2 clinical trial is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRA023 in patients with moderate-to-severe UC who have had insufficient response, loss of response, or intolerance to conventional therapy, including biologic treatment. The primary cohort of approximately 120 patients is statistically powered to evaluate the efficacy of PRA023 based on the primary endpoint of clinical remission at 12 weeks defined by the Modified Mayo Score, a composite instrument for assessing ulcerative colitis treatment that consists of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and centrally read endoscopic score. The dosing regimen is 1,000 mg IV on day 1, followed by 500 mg IV on weeks 2, 6, and 10. Secondary endpoints of endoscopic improvement, clinical response, clinical remission (in companion diagnostic-positive patients) and histological remission are ranked and will be sequentially tested to control for multiplicity. An expansion cohort of patients pre-screened using our companion diagnostic candidate and testing positive for an increased propensity for TL1A expression will be recruited to ensure that that there is a total of approximately 80 companion diagnostic-positive patients to enable a statistically powered cohort to further evaluate the effectiveness of our companion diagnostic candidate in patients with UC. The ARTEMIS-UC study is currently being rolled out globally and we plan to enroll patients at approximately 75 sites across 14 countries.
 
The ARTEMIS-UC study also includes an open-label extension after the 12-week induction study. Clinical responders are stratified by their positive or negative companion diagnostic status and re-randomized into two different maintenance dose arms of 250 mg IV every 4 weeks or 100 mg IV every 4 weeks. Non-responders at the end of induction will have the option for a course of open-label induction therapy. Responders at the end of this open-label induction therapy will be randomized to the two maintenance dose regimen and non-responders will be discontinued from the study.
 APOLLO-CD: Phase 2a Clinical Trial of PRA023 in Crohn’s Disease
 
Our APOLLO-CD Phase 2a clinical trial is a 12-week open-label study designed as a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRA023 in moderate-to-severe CD with endoscopically active disease who have had insufficient response, loss of response, or intolerance to conventional therapy including biologic treatment. The primary endpoint at week 12 is the proportion of patients achieving endoscopic improvement as defined by 50% decrease in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD), which assesses the size of mucosal ulcers, the ulcerated surface, the endoscopic extent of disease, and the presence of stenosis. The endoscopies are centrally read by readers who are blinded to the timepoint at which the endoscopic videos are obtained. Similar to the 
 11


ARTEMIS-UC trial, the dosing regimen is 1,000 mg IV on day 1, followed by 500 mg IV on weeks 2, 6, and 10. Each subject will also be assessed for their positive or negative companion diagnostic status and subgroup analyses for all endpoints will be conducted based on companion diagnostic results. The APOLLO-CD study is currently being rolled out globally and we plan to enroll patients at approximately 50 sites across 10 countries.
 
The APOLLO-CD study also includes an open-label extension at the end of the 12-week induction study, in which clinical responders are re-randomized to the two maintenance doses (250 mg IV every 4 weeks or 100 mg IV every 4 weeks) and non-responders will be discontinued from the study.
 
Preclinical Studies of PRA023
 PRA023 is an investigational, humanized IgG1 mAb that uses a novel epitope relative to PF-006480605 and potently binds human and cynomolgus monkey TL1A. PRA023 has sub-nanomolar binding affinity to both soluble TL1A monomer and trimers and nanomolar affinity to membrane-associated TL1A. In in vitro studies, PRA023 blocked TL1A’s ability to bind and activate its receptor, DR3. In whole blood, PRA023 inhibited the TL1A-dependent IFN-g response following the ex vivo exposure to immune-complex and a combination of IL-12 and IL-18. Additionally, PRA023 was observed to be highly selective for TL1A with no detectable binding to related TNF super family members FAS, LIGHT, or TRAIL. 
 We assessed the potential toxicity of PRA023 in a series of nonclinical in vitro assays and in vivo studies in cynomolgus monkeys. The monkey was selected as a pharmacologically relevant nonclinical species because of similar TL1A protein sequence homology and nearly equivalent binding affinity of PRA023 to monkey TL1A, as compared to human. PRA023 is similarly active in monkey and human in vitro cell-based assays. 
 PRA023 has been engineered to remove the potential for the mAb to induce an immune response. In non-good laboratory practice (GLP) cell-based in vitro assays, PRA023 treatment did not lead to complement- or cell-mediated cytotoxicity or to cytokine release from peripheral blood cells thus indicating that it was not provoking an undesired immune response.
 In a non-GLP tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) study, cynomolgus monkeys (1/sex/group) were administered PRA023 IV at 30, 100 and 243 mg/kg/week on Days 1 and 8 and subsequently followed for approximately 11 weeks to assess systemic exposure of PRA023. There were no PRA023-related clinical observations or changes in body weight, clinical chemistry, or hematology parameters. PK measurements suggested that PRA023 has a half-life of 5 to 11 days in cynomolgus monkeys, which is consistent with human IgG1 in this species. 
 Six-week and 6-month Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys with a 6-week recovery period. In the 6-month toxicity study, PRA023 was administered to monkeys once weekly via IV injection for up to 6 months. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the 6-month study was 300 mg/kg/week (the highest dose tested). No PRA023-related mortality or clinical signs were observed, and no body weight, food consumption, clinal pathology (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), ECG, ophthalmic, neurobehavioral, body temperature, respirator, organ weight, or macroscopic or microscopic changes were observed at the end of the dosing or recovery phases after six months of repeat dosing in monkeys. No PRA023-related effects were noted in lymphocyte subsets. All animals mounted a robust anti-KLH IgG and IgM response, suggesting an intact humoral immunity. 
 After IV administration of PRA023 to monkeys in the 6-week repeat-dose toxicity study, findings that were secondary to generation of ADA and immune complex deposition in response to administration of a foreign protein (humanized monoclonal antibody) to immunocompetent animals were observed (including the death of one low dose animal). Similar findings were not observed in the 6-month monkey toxicity study using the same dosing regimen and dose levels, confirming that the findings in the 6-week repeat-dose toxicity study were secondary to ADA formation and not directly related to the mechanism of action of PRA023. 
 PRA023 in Additional Immune-Mediated Diseases
 We believe PRA023 has the potential to be a differentiated therapy for patients suffering from various immune-mediated diseases, beyond IBD, due to PRA023’s unique dual mechanism including both anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects: the TL1A-DR3 pathway is known to broadly modulate multiple immune cell types, in addition to having a direct effect on fibroblasts proliferation and differentiation. In December 2021, in connection with the positive results we observed for PRA023 in our Phase 1 clinical trial, we announced our plans to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for PRA023 in patients with SSc-ILD and we continue to evaluate potential additional indications for PRA023 in other immune-mediated diseases.
 Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease 
 12



Systemic sclerosis, also called scleroderma, is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes fibrosis, or scarring/hardening, of skin and internal organs. It is not known what causes scleroderma, but this orphan disease affects more than 100,000 people in the United States and 80,000 people in Europe, and has no known cure. More than half of scleroderma patients have fibrosis of the lungs. This syndrome is termed systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), and it is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in scleroderma, accounting for one third of deaths. SSc-ILD tends to present as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, which implies a mixed pathogenesis of inflammation and fibrosis.
 
SSc-ILD is progressive in most patients and is thought to be largely irreversible, so stabilization has historically been the goal of therapy. Immunosuppressive therapies are prescribed off-label and may provide some relief without specific approval for this indication. In the past two years, two biologics were approved for SSc-ILD, but these only modestly slow the rate of decline in lung function and neither of these therapies has led to meaningful benefits for disease modification as measured using skin thickness scoring, dyspnea, general quality of life or survival.
 We believe SSc-ILD is a compelling third indication for PRA023. TL1A inhibition has a unique dual mechanism with both anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects and SSc-ILD is a disease of inflammation and fibrosis with a pathophysiology that implicates many pathways modulated by TL1A-DR3 interactions. Blocking TL1A has been linked to reductions in Th1, Th17 and Th2 immune responses, while also modulating key pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokine such as IL-13 and TGF-β. In addition to their roles in driving inflammation, TL1A and DR3 have also been implicated in driving fibrosis by direct signaling in fibroblasts, even in the absence of a fully functional immune system, leading to collagen disposition and fibrosis.
 A causal link between the TL1A-DR3 axis and fibrosis has been demonstrated in mouse models of lung fibrosis. Specifically, DR3 deficiency or TL1A blockade was sufficient to significantly ameliorate fibrotic lung remodeling in bleomycin and dust-mite antigen models. Additionally, direct instillation of recombinant TL1A into the lungs of mice initiated rapid onset of fibrosis and smooth muscle cell proliferation in a DR3-dependent manner. Primary human lung fibroblasts and bronchial epithelial cells express the TL1A receptor, DR3, and respond to recombinant TL1A in vitro by proliferating, expressing smooth muscle actin, and secreting extracellular matrix proteins, collagen, and periostin. Serum TL1A levels were higher in patients with systemic sclerosis than in healthy controls (p = 0.001) and TL1A mRNA expression in PBMCs was significantly higher in patients with systemic sclerosis compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Agents that disrupt the TL1A signaling through DR3 have the potential to prevent deregulated tissue cell activity in lung diseases that involve fibrosis and remodeling.
 PRA023 for SSc-ILD
 In December 2021, we announced our plans to initiate ATHENA-SSc-ILD, a Phase 2 clinical trial for PRA023 in SSc-ILD in the first quarter of 2022. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 100 patients who will be randomized 1:1 to either the active or placebo arm. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the change in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 50 weeks. Secondary endpoints will include change in quantitative interstitial lung disease by centrally-read high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and improvement in the American College of Rheumatology Combined Response Index in Diffuse SSc (ACR-CRISS) score. We also plan to evaluate a variety of patient reported outcomes for dyspnea, disability, effects of skin thickening, and bowel function. This trial will also assess the performance of our companion diagnostic candidate for PRA023.
 In January 2022, we announced that the FDA granted fast track designation for PRA023 for the treatment of SSc-ILD. Fast track designation aims to expedite the development and review process for new therapeutics that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and potentially address an unmet medical need. Drug candidates that are granted this designation are given the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA, as well as potential pathways for expedited review and approval.
 PR600 Program
 Our PR600 program targets a member of the TNF super family with a key impact on the function of memory T cells and T follicular helper cells in immune-mediated diseases. This target, expressed by immune cells, drives downstream biological pathways distinct from those activated by TNF or TL1A. It has been shown that blocking this target inhibits disease in multiple IBD animal models. We believe that a therapeutic developed against this target is has the potential to impede both the reactivation and propagation of the pathogenic immune response in IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases. We have identified multiple genetic variants linked to patient subpopulations with a complicated course of disease. We have conducted functional genetic studies in patient samples and have identified genetic variations associated with an increase in target expressing immune cells in CD peripheral blood and an increased capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines. We intend to leverage Prometheus360 in combination with functional assays to identify patients with these genetic variants. 
 13


In 2020, we entered into a co-development and manufacturing agreement (the Falk Agreement) with Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH (Falk) for our PR600 program, in order to leverage Falk’s experience in GI drug development and commercialization in Europe. Under this agreement, we granted to Falk exclusive commercialization rights in Europe, Australia and New Zealand for PR600 and its companion diagnostic, while we retained commercialization rights in the United States and the rest of the world. In 2021, we earned both preclinical milestone payments from Falk relating to our selection of a clinical candidate and our development of a companion diagnostic candidate for the PR600 program. We expect to submit an IND for our PR600 therapeutic candidate in the third quarter of 2022.
 PR300 Program 
 Our PR300 program targets an orphan GPCR expressed predominantly in the GI tract that we believe has important functions underlying intestinal epithelial integrity and innate immune cell function. We have identified a coding SNP in the gene of this target that represents a very strong genetic association with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases. 
PR1100 Program
 Our PR1100 program targets the receptor for a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been linked to multiple immune-mediated diseases. In particular, the pathway modulated by our target has been associated, both functionally and genetically, with IBD, highlighting a possible role in the pathogenesis of this disease. We have identified SNPs in the gene locus of this target that are associated with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases.
PR1800 Program 


 Our PR1800 program targets a chemo-attractant factor which contributes to the local accumulation of a defined inflammatory effector cell population in the GI tract. Factors secreted by these effector cells are believed to deteriorate the structure and protective functions of the intestinal mucosal barrier. We have identified SNPs in the gene locus of this target that are associated with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases. 
PR2100 Program 
 Our PR2100 program targets a cytokine implicated in a range of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. In IBD specifically, this cytokine has been implicated to contribute to non-response to anti-TNF therapies. We have identified SNPs in the gene locus of this target that are associated with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases.
Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect intellectual property and other proprietary rights for our current and future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies, patient enrichment strategies and companion diagnostics, and know-how, to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or exclusively in-licensing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing of intellectual property to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 As for the therapeutic product candidates we are developing and seeking to commercialize, we intend to pursue composition and therapeutic method of use patents, dosage formulation patents, and therapeutic use patents on novel indications. For our therapeutic product candidates that are biologics, and more particularly monoclonal antibodies, we also intend to seek protection for epitopes, amino acid and nucleotide sequences, and other claims conventionally used to protect aspects of therapeutic biological agents. As for diagnostic and prognostic products and product candidates, we intend to pursue methods of use patents on novel patient selection methods for our therapeutic candidates and known compounds, and novel patient stratification criteria useful in the prognosis or diagnosis of disease. We may also pursue patents with respect to our proprietary screening and drug development processes and technology. We may also seek patent protection, either alone or jointly with our collaborators, as our collaboration agreements may dictate. 
 Our patent portfolio as of March 1, 2022 includes approximately 17 issued U.S. patents, 28 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 25 pending U.S. provisional patent applications with claims relating to all of our product candidates, all of which are owned or in-licensed by us. We own three of the issued U.S. patents and own or co-own approximately seven of the pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications. We license approximately 14 of the issued U.S. patents, as well as 21 of the pending U.S. non-
 14


provisional patent applications. Our patent portfolio as of March 1, 202 also includes approximately 1 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications and certain foreign counterparts of approximately 28 of the aforementioned U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications in at least one of the following foreign countries or regions: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan and countries within the European Patent Convention and Eurasia with claims relating to all of our product candidates. 
 With respect to our lead therapeutic product candidate, PRA023, we own or license two issued U.S. patents, four pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and six pending U.S. provisional patent applications in five different patent families relating to the composition of PRA023 and its therapeutic use, as well as one issued U.S. patent, two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and two pending U.S. provisional patent applications related to the companion diagnostic for PRA023. In addition, our non-U.S. patent portfolio directed to the composition of PRA023 and its companion diagnostic includes one pending PCT application and foreign counterparts in foreign countries or regions, including Argentina, Australia, Taiwan, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Canada, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Korea, China, Indonesia, New Zealand, Venezuela, as well as countries within the European Patent Convention. As of March 1, 2022, we expect the expiry dates for the issued U.S. patents for the composition of PRA023 to be 2037 for the first patent family, and 2039 for the second patent family, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees. 
 As of March 1, 2022, we co-own and license from Cedars-Sinai one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application and two U.S. provisional patent applications related to patient selection for our PR600 program. In addition, our non-U.S. patent portfolio directed to the composition of PR600 and patient selection for PR600 includes one pending PCT application and foreign counterparts in foreign countries or regions, including Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, as well as countries within the European Patent Convention. As of March 1, 2022, we expect any U.S. non-provisional patent application timely filed based on this PCT application, if issued, to expire no earlier than 2042, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees. 
 As of March 1, 2022, we own one issued U.S. non-provisional patent application, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application and two pending U.S. provisional patent applications, as well as one pending PCT application, related to the composition of matter for our PR300 program. As of March 1, 2022, we expect the expiry dates for such patent applications related to PR300, if issued, to be no earlier than 2040, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees.
 Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. Moreover, PCT patent applications are not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file one or more national stage patent applications within, depending on the country, 30 to 32 months of the PCT application’s priority date in the countries in which we seek patent protection. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications or national stage patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications or PCT patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications and national stage patent applications relating to our PCT patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage. 
 Individual issued patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. The term of a patent, and the protection it affords, is therefore limited and once the patent term of our issued patents have expired, we may face competition, including from other competing technologies. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
 In addition, in certain instances, a U.S. patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period or delay by the USPTO in issuing the patent. However, with respect to patent term extensions granted as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it may be extended. We may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length 
 15


of the extension could be less than we request. There can be no assurance that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. 
 The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. 
 If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties, including our competitors, may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs or diagnostic and/or prognostic products in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we may develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that may diminish our ability to protect our intellectual property. For more information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Rapidly evolving patent laws in the United States and elsewhere make it difficult to predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Moreover, patent offices in general can require that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated. 
 Our ability to maintain and defend our intellectual property and proprietary position for our products, product candidates and other technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own, may receive in the future, or license from third parties may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, narrowed or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against third parties, including our competitors, with similar technology. Furthermore, third parties, including our competitors, may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or products, or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. 
 Trade Secrets 
 We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop, protect and maintain our competitive position and aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not presently consider appropriate for, patent protection and prevent competitors from reverse engineering or copying our technologies. However, the foregoing rights are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be self-executing or otherwise provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by third parties, including our competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information regarding risks related to our trade secrets, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Collaboration and License Agreement Overview 
 Our Collaboration with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center 
 In September 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Cedars-Sinai, as amended and restated (the Cedars-Sinai Agreement) that grants us an exclusive, worldwide license from Cedars-Sinai with respect to certain patent rights, information and materials related to therapeutic targets and companion diagnostic products for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases, in each case to conduct research and development, as well as to commercialize diagnostic or therapeutic products (Cedars-Sinai Products) that are covered by the patents or that are developed through use of the licensed rights. As upfront consideration for the original license agreement, we issued to Cedars-Sinai 257,500 shares of fully vested common stock and 335,000 
 16


shares of restricted common stock, which shares fully vested in September 2020. We are obligated to pay Cedars-Sinai low- to mid-single digit percentage royalties on net sales of therapeutic and diagnostic Cedars-Sinai Products. In August 2021, we amended and restated the Cedars-Sinai Agreement to, among other things, add a joint steering committee and cover new intellectual property.
 
The technology subject to the foregoing license includes information and materials arising out of the Cedars-Sinai database and biobank, as well as exclusive access to this database and biobank to develop diagnostic and therapeutic products for human use, which biobank is an integral part of our Prometheus360 platform. All of our current pipeline programs and any related companion diagnostics are all covered as Cedars-Sinai Products under the agreement, to the extent covered by the licensed patents or developed through the licensed rights. We were also granted an exclusive first right to negotiate with Cedars-Sinai to obtain exclusive licenses to future patent rights claiming inventions invented by certain Cedars-Sinai employees after the effective date of the agreement through any use of the patent rights and technology licensed to us by Cedars-Sinai. We have the right to sublicense our rights under the license agreement, subject to certain conditions. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize Cedars-Sinai Products and to achieve certain development and regulatory milestones. 
 
The term of, and our royalty obligations under, the license agreement expires on a licensed Cedars-Sinai Product-by-Cedars-Sinai Product and country-by-country basis on the later of ten years from the date of first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent covering such licensed Cedars-Sinai Product in such country. As of March 1, 2022, the estimated expiry date for the latest to expire valid patent will be December 2042, if issued. We may terminate the agreement in the event that we determine that it would not be commercially reasonable to continue to develop and/or commercialize Cedars-Sinai Products. Cedars-Sinai may terminate the agreement if the performance by either party would jeopardize Cedars-Sinai’s legal status or is illegal or unethical. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. The agreement will terminate automatically in the event of our bankruptcy. Upon termination of the agreement for any reason all rights and licenses granted to us under the agreement will terminate.
 
Our Collaboration with Falk 
 In July 2020, we entered into a co-development and manufacturing agreement (the Falk Agreement) with Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH (Falk), pursuant to which we will co-develop and commercialize, exclusively in our respective territories, our PR600 therapeutic product candidate and companion diagnostic test. Under the Falk Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct such development activities under an agreed development plan and we are responsible for regulatory approvals and commercialization of any products in the United States and the rest of the world, other than the Falk territory. Falk is responsible for regulatory approvals and commercialization of any products in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, the countries of the European Economic Area (excluding Malta and the Republic of Cyprus), Australia and New Zealand (Falk territory). Under the agreement, Falk agreed to fund 25% of our third party development costs set forth in the mutually agreed upon development plan. 
 Under the agreement, Falk paid us an upfront payment of $2.5 million and made a second payment of $2.5 million following our mutual agreement on the development plan. In addition, in June 2021, Falk made a milestone payment of $10 million to us upon the selection of a clinical candidate for our PR600 program and, in December 2021, Falk made the final milestone payment of $5 million to us, based on our development of a companion diagnostic candidate for the PRA600 program. Falk is also obligated to pay us a mid-single to low-double digit royalty on net sales of all products incorporating antibodies covered by the agreement in the Falk territory. We agreed to pay Falk a low-single digit royalty on net sales for such products in our territory. Any intellectual property, including know-how, owned by us, Falk, or our respective affiliates that existed prior to the effective date of the agreement or is generated during the term of the agreement, that is also necessary or useful to develop, manufacture, or commercialize the compounds and/or products that result from the collaboration, are jointly owned by us and Falk at a share of 75% for us and a 25% for Falk. 
 The term of, and our respective royalty obligations under, the agreement expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the later of (i) ten years from the date of first commercial sale, (ii) when there is no longer a valid patent covering a product in such country, or (iii) expiration of any applicable regulatory exclusivity for such product. As of March 1, 2022, the estimated expiry date for the latest to expire valid patent will be December 2042, if issued. Falk may terminate the agreement without cause, and either party may terminate the agreement for regulatory or scientific reasons. In the event of such termination, all licenses granted to the terminating party will cease and be transferred to the non-terminating party, and such non-terminating party will have access to the know-how and any other intellectual property controlled by the terminating party, if in existence as of the effective date of the agreement or during the term of the agreement, provided the know-how and other intellectual property is necessary or useful to develop, manufacture, or commercialize the therapeutic candidates under the PR600 program, subject to the obligation to pay the applicable royalties to the terminating party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by, or bankruptcy of, the other party. In the event of such termination, the terminating party has the option to purchase the non-terminating party’s ownership share of any jointly owned intellectual property at a fair market price. Additionally, in the event of such termination for uncured material breach or bankruptcy: all rights of the terminating party granted under the agreement will be maintained and extended as required to develop, manufacture and commercialize the compounds and/or products that result from the 
 17


collaboration for the remainder of the term, while any licenses granted to the non-terminating party shall terminate upon the effective date of termination and the obligation of each party to co-fund development will remain unaffected.
 Our Collaboration with Takeda 
 In March 2019, we entered into a Companion Diagnostic Development and Collaboration Agreement (the Takeda Agreement) with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda, pursuant to which we agreed to develop a companion diagnostic product (Diagnostic Product) for drug targets selected by Takeda, and Takeda agreed to develop and commercialize any therapeutic clinical candidates that it develops directed against any selected drug targets for the treatment of IBD (Takeda Drugs). Takeda paid us an upfront technology access fee and agreed to reimburse us for certain research and development expenses. In the event the parties agree on any drug targets to advance under the agreement, we would be eligible to receive various milestone payments, including future development and regulatory milestone payments, commercial milestone payments, and sales milestone payments, provided that regulatory approval for the applicable Takeda Drug includes use of the associated Diagnostic Product. In addition, Takeda would be obligated to pay us a low-single digit percentage royalty on net sales of all Takeda Drugs, subject to certain reductions.
 The term of, and royalty obligations under, the Takeda Agreement expires on a Takeda Drug-by-Takeda Drug and country-by-country basis on the later of (i) ten years from the date of first commercial sale, (ii) when there is no longer a valid patent covering a Takeda Drug in such country, and (iii) expiration of any applicable regulatory exclusivity for such Takeda Drug. Takeda may terminate the agreement at any time with or without cause. We may terminate the agreement in the case of lack of scientific merits or insurmountable technical challenges in developing a diagnostic product for any selected targets, despite using diligent efforts. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by, or bankruptcy of, the other party. Upon termination of the agreement, the licenses granted to each party by the other party under the agreement will terminate; except that if we terminate the agreement due to scientific or technical challenges, or Takeda terminates the agreement due to an uncured material breach by us, or bankruptcy of ours and Takeda opts to continue the development and commercialization of any Takeda Drug for use with the associated diagnostic product, then if Takeda proceeds to commercialize any Takeda Drug for use with the associated diagnostic product after the termination of the agreement, any remaining Takeda payment obligations in connection with the associated target will be reduced by a specified percent.
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and related raw materials for preclinical and clinical development, as well as for commercial manufacture of any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval. We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates and development programs. As our product candidates advance through development, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers to fulfill and secure our production needs. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We believe that we can maximize the value of our products by retaining substantial commercialization rights to our product candidates and companion diagnostics, and, where appropriate, entering into collaborations for specific therapeutic indications or geographic territories. 
 As we progress PRA023 and other development programs through clinical development, we will leverage the knowledge and experience of our sales team and company brand awareness to prepare for and implement a potential product launch. 
 We have global commercial rights to PRA023 and its companion diagnostic. Our current commercial strategy is to market PRA023 and its companion diagnostics using a dedicated sales force focused on selected gastroenterologists, rheumatologists, and other physicians in the United States. These target prescribers are typically affiliated with leading hospitals and medical centers and tend to have well-established referral networks. We expect to benefit from preexisting relationships with many of these prescribers and believe that we can appropriately manage outreach and effectively commercialize PRA023 through a specialty care sales model. We retain rights similar to those for PRA023 for each of our unpartnered programs. For PR600, which is subject to the Falk collaboration, we have exclusively outlicensed commercialization rights to Falk in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. However, we retain commercial rights to our PR600 program in the United States and the rest of the world and plan to take a similar commercialization approach as with PRA023, if approved. 
 Competition 
 18


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience, our Prometheus360 platform and our pioneering culture provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any therapeutic candidates and companion diagnostics that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize therapeutic products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, or companion diagnostics that are more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive products. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level competition, intellectual property protection and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 If approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe IBD, PRA023 and our other development programs would compete with Entyvio, which is an a4b7 integrin antibody marketed by Takeda, Humira, which is a TNF antibody marketed by AbbVie Inc., Remicade, which is a TNF antibody marketed by Johnson & Johnson, Stelara, which is an IL-12/IL-23 antibody marketed by Johnson & Johnson, Xeljanz, which is a JAK1 inhibitor marketed by Pfizer Inc., Simponi, which is a TNF antibody marketed by Johnson & Johnson, and Zeposia, which is a S1P inhibitor marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. 
 
We are aware of several companies with product candidates in development for the treatment of patients with UC and/or CD, including but not limited to Pfizer Inc.’s PF-06480605, which is an anti-TL1A antibody being developed in Phase 2 clinical trials, Rinvoq, which is a JAK1 inhibitor being developed in Phase 3 clinical trials by AbbVie Inc., and mirikizumab, which is an anti-IL-23 antibody being developed in Phase 3 clinical trials by Eli Lilly and Company. We are also aware of additional product candidates in clinical trials by AbbVie Inc., Abivax S.A., Amgen Inc., Applied Molecular Transport Inc., Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Bausch Health Companies, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, EA Pharma Co., Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Gossamer Bio, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Landos Biopharma, Inc., Morphic Holding, Inc., Merck & Co. Inc., Novartis International AG, Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., RedHill Biopharma Ltd. and Seres Therapeutics, Inc. 
 
If approved for the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD, PRA023 would compete with Ofev, which is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim AG and Actemra, which is an IL-6 antibody marketed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG. We are aware of several companies with product candidates in development for the treatment of patients for SSc-ILD, including but not limited to Castle Creek Biosciences, Inc., Certa Therapeutics Pty Ltd., Chemomab Therapeutics Ltd., Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc., Emerald Health Pharmaceuticals Inc., Forbius PTY Limited, GlaxoSmithKline plc., Horizon Therapeutics plc, Incyte Corporation, Kyowa Kirin plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Sanofi S.A., and Seagen, Inc.
Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, pricing, and export and import of diagnostic tests and pharmaceutical products such as those we are currently marketing and developing. The process of obtaining and maintaining 
 19


regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 U.S. Regulation of Diagnostic Tests and other Medical Devices 
 In the United States, the laws and regulations governing the marketing of diagnostic products are evolving, extremely complex, and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) defines a medical device to include any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory, intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals. Among other things, pursuant to the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. 
 PMA Pathway 
 We are developing companion diagnostics to be used in connection with our therapeutic product candidates, if approved. These companion diagnostics are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA categorizes medical devices into one of three classes—Class I, II, or III—based on the risks presented by the device and the regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (QSR) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Special controls are established by the FDA for a specific device type and often include specific labeling provisions, performance metrics, and other types of controls that mitigate risks of the device (usually incorrect results for an in-vitro diagnostic device (IVD)). Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of an application for premarket approval (PMA). Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. 
 Class III devices, including most companion diagnostics, generally require PMA approval before they can be marketed. Obtaining PMA approval requires the submission of “valid scientific evidence” to the FDA to support a finding of a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA must provide complete analytical and clinical performance data and also information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. As part of the FDA’s review of a PMA, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with QSR requirements, which impose requirements related to design controls, manufacturing controls, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The user fee costs and the length of FDA review time for obtaining PMA approval are significantly higher than for a 510(k) notification or a de novo classification. 
 The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. 
 Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive 
 20


clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. 
 We expect that any companion diagnostics we develop, either alone or in collaboration with third parties, will require approval of a PMA before they can be marketed for use with a therapeutic product. 
 510(k) Notification Pathway 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA’s satisfaction that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to another legally marketed device that itself does not require PMA approval (a predicate device). A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but often takes longer. FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed predicate device, it will grant 510(k) clearance to authorize the device for commercialization. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, discussed below. 
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacturer documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, if the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. 
 These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. More recently, in September 2019, the FDA published revised final guidance outlining an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway, by demonstrating that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based pathway” and has continued to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as recommended the testing methods for such devices where feasible. 
 If no legally marketed predicate can be identified for a new device to enable use of the 510(k) pathway, the device is automatically classified under the FDCA into Class III, which generally requires PMA approval. However, the FDA can reclassify or seek de novo classification for a device that meets the FDCA standards for a Class I or Class II device, permitting the device to be marketed without PMA approval. To grant such a reclassification, the FDA must determine that the FDCA’s general controls alone, or general controls and special controls together, are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. The de novo classification route is generally less burdensome than the PMA approval process. 
 21


De Novo Classification 
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified under the FDCA into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA) a medical device could be eligible for de novo classification only if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) notification, determines that the device is not low to moderate risk, or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. After a device receives de novo classification, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, another de novo request or even PMA approval. 
 Investigational Device Exemption Process. 
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. 
 In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. 
 
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping, and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs for Medical Devices 
 22


Through recent federal legislation, the FDA has implemented a Breakthrough Devices Program, which is a voluntary program offering manufacturers of certain devices an opportunity to interact with the FDA more frequently and efficiently as they develop their products with the goal of expediting commercialization of such products to help patients have more timely access. The program is available to medical devices that meet certain eligibility criteria, including that the device provides more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions, and constitutes a device (i) that represents a breakthrough technology, (ii) for which no approved or cleared alternatives exist, (iii) that offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives, or (iv) the availability of which is in the best interest of patients. Devices granted Breakthrough Device designation are eligible to rely on certain features of the Breakthrough Device Program, including interactive and timely communications with FDA staff, use of post-market data collection, when scientifically appropriate, to facilitate expedited and efficient development and review of the device, opportunities for efficient and flexible clinical study design and priority review of premarket submissions. 
Postmarket Regulation of Medical Devices 
 After a device is cleared or approved by the FDA for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
  
• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;

 Device manufacturing processes subject to FDA oversight are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Manufacturers are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. A failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. 
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, including the following: 
  
• | issuance of warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requesting or requiring recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;

 FDA U.S. Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 23


If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an IVD, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic product candidates will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluations and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. 
 We currently anticipate that each of our therapeutic product candidates will require us to develop and obtain FDA approval of a companion diagnostic for such therapeutic product candidates. 
 U.S. Regulation of Drugs and Biologics 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with GLP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy, or with respect to biologics, the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA) or biologics license application (BLA) after completion of all pivotal clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product drug substance is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and audits of selected clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology and PD characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies 
 24


suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, and any clinically important increased rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries. 
 The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. 
 NDA and BLA Review Process 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated and sponsored by investigators. The submission of an NDA or BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) a NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDASIA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial pediatric study plan within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 25


Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the submitted BLA or NDA to determine if the application is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once an NDA or BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is sufficient to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. When reviewing an NDA or BLA, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs for Drugs and Biologics 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, product candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, the application may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. 
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may 
 26


demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers. 
 Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA or BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs and original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug or biologic was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs and Biologics 
 Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such 
 27


as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA or BLA. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Drug Product Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. For example, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant 
 28


submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. 
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are highly similar, or “biosimilar,” to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, is generally shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A product shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product may rely in part on the FDA’s previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for approval, which can potentially reduce the cost and time required to obtain approval to market the product. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industries. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties. These laws include anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, and transparency laws with respect to drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals. In addition to the federal laws summarized below, we may also be subject to similar state and local laws and regulations that may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the 
 29


federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse-midwives) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined under the statute) and their immediate family members. 
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement of Drugs 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors. 
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of a product, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other 
 30


available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Additionally, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States, there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates. 
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace.  The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. 
 
Foreign Regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence 
 31


clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, or EU, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 To market a medicinal product in the European Economic Area (EEA) (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), we must obtain a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
  
• | the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Data and marketing exclusivity 
 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 
Pediatric investigation plan 
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan (PIP) agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines on GCPs. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of 
 32


the clinical trial is not established within the European Union, it must appoint an entity within the European Union to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial. 
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect in 2019, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements also apply. 
 Privacy and data protection laws 
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area, or EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom (UK), GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
