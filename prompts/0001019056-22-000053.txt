The Company built and validated a new cGMP clean room processing and manufacturing area at our facility in Monmouth Junction NJ, implemented and validated cGMP Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and installed a new Quality Management System to support its IND filings and an increased focus on patent and product development and support additional clinical activities.
 
The Company has built a domestic and international patent portfolio consisting of 32 patents. Our 4 primary operating patents regarding the “collection – processing – cryopreservation and return to point-of-care” of adipose derived stem cells, have been granted.
 
The Company is expanding its efforts to attract and cultivate collaborative partners to accelerate its product development efforts, harnessing its manufacturing platform and tissue processing platforms. The R&D collaborations are to discover, develop, and commercialize cellular therapies, laboratory products and combinations thereof with synergistic technologies to create regenerative medicine applications and develop new intellectual property.
 
Adipose Tissue
 
The Company’s manufacturing platform technologies, cell transportation products, cell culture mediums and cell therapies are focused on the acquisition and processing of adipose tissue as the primary raw material. Many of our developed technologies have been successfully applied to other raw materials such as bone marrow, umbilical and placenta tissue. Adipose tissue, also known as fat tissue or fatty tissue, is a connective tissue that is mainly composed of fat cells called adipocytes. Adipocytes are energy storing cells that contain large globules of fat known as lipid droplets surrounded by a structural network of fibers. tissue and other stromal tissues. The Company is focused on adipose tissue because it contains higher densities of mesenchymal stems cells (often 500 to 1000 times more) per gram of raw material when compared to other sources (bone marrow, umbilical cord tissue, etc). The higher cellular density of adipose tissue supports the ability to create regenerative cellular products more efficiently and with less expansion (lower passages and population doublings), which is preferred when producing cellular therapy products.
 
Adipose tissue is considered one of the top human stem cell sources considering its accessibility, abundance, and least painful collection procedure when compared to other sources such as bone marrow. The adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) that adipose tissue contains can be maintained and expanded in culture for long periods of time without losing their differentiation capacity, leading to large cell quantities being increasingly used in cell therapy purposes. Many published and peer reviewed reports show that ADSC-based cell therapy products demonstrated optimal efficacy and efficiency in various clinical indications for both autologous and allogeneic purposes, hence they are increasingly being considered as potential tools for replacing, repairing, and regenerating dead or damaged cells.
 
Adipose tissue is a specialized type of connective tissue that arises from the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes during fetal development. Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells that can transform into various cell types, including fat cells, bone cells, cartilage cells, and muscle cells among others. Adipose tissue can be found in a number of different places throughout the body. Adipose tissue is the most abundant type of fat in humans. It is distributed within subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, and bone marrow fat. Subcutaneous fat is found throughout the whole body, in the spaces between the skin and underlying muscles. Visceral fat is predominantly found around the organs in the abdominal cavity, such as the liver, intestines and kidneys, as well as in the peritoneum (a serous membrane that lines the outside of the abdominal organs). Adipose tissue is also present in bone marrow (a sponge-like tissue present in the central cavity of bones). In addition, adipose tissue can be found in the pericardium surrounding the heart, or cushioning other parts of the body, like the soles of the feet, eyeballs, and certain blood vessels.
 
The main function of adipocytes is to store excess energy in the form of fatty molecules, mainly triglycerides. Fat storage is regulated by several hormones, including insulin, glucagon, catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline), and cortisol. Depending on the body’s immediate energy requirements, these hormones can either stimulate adipose tissue formation and storage (i.e. lipogenesis) or initiate the release of fat from adipose tissue (i.e. lipolysis). Under the influence of insulin, for instance, adipocytes can increase the uptake of blood glucose and transform it into fatty molecules, thereby increasing fat storage.
 
In addition to being an energy storing reservoir, adipose tissue performs important endocrine and metabolic roles by secreting several biologically-active factors known as adipokines. These molecules contribute to a variety of different functions, including regulation of energy balance, food intake and satiety, inflammatory response, and metabolism of steroid hormones. Finally, adipose tissue also helps cushion and protect parts of the body, as well as insulate the body from extreme temperatures.
 
In addition to adipocytes, adipose tissue contains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) comprised of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and a variety of immune cells such as adipose tissue macrophages. Far from being hormonally inert, adipose tissue has, in recent years, been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resisting, and cytokines (especially TNFα). Adipose tissue contains some of the highest concentrations of adult stem cells, progenitor cells and immune cells.

Processing Technology 
 
The FDA considers processing and expanding cells as the manufacturing of a drug product. The Company’s completed proprietary, patented processing and manufacturing platform is designed for the collection, preparation and cryo-preservation of pure adipose tissue and adipose tissue derived cells. The processing platform has been validated to enable the Company to deliver cellular therapy samples with repeatable and identifiable characteristics of safety, potency, viability, and purity which are the core FDA requirements for the cGMP manufacturing of all drug products. Our manufacturing platform is approved by FDA for use in our current clinical study of Post Concussion Syndrome for the manufacturing of the cellular therapy samples. The Company believes that the platform is suitable to support the Company’s growing pipeline of product development and planned clinical studies, and future biologic license applications for an array of target diseases and conditions.
 
The Company believes the reproducibility of scientific studies is a substantial issue in cellular therapy research, from drug discovery and development through clinical trials as researchers throughout the world continue to use different protocols for processes associated with cell sample preparation, cryopreservation, and cold chain management. We believe our validated manufacturing processes for our ATCell™ product solves this issue. The samples we produce with our patented platform and proprietary products have proven purity, consistent viabilities above 80 percent, and cell identification panels across six biomarkers and proven sterility. Our standardizing handling, storage, and transportation protocols substantially improve the quality and reproducibility of adipose tissue derived stem cells and the adipose tissue collection, processing, storage and retrieval which is designed to permit us to accelerate the time line of creating and processing cellular therapy products - from lab research to regulatory submission and FDA approval.
 
Each individual process has the potential to create multiple autologous products and to generate multiple revenue streams including customer fees for storage of biomaterials. Our processing platform and methodology allow the opportunity for continuing revenue streams from each tissue sample received and processed including, cellular therapy treatments, pure tissue storage for secondary procedures, processing, and handling fees and CRYO storage and release fees.
 
We are leveraging our patented platform and developing our product portfolio to create a global footprint of licensed laboratory affiliates, physician’ networks, patients, research organizations, and licensees who purchase tissue collection, processing and storage services or consumables from our Company.
 


Products and Services
 
Therapy Product Development
 
During the Company’s initial stage of developing its manufacturing protocol and products chose adipose tissue as its source material following review and experiments that included other biomaterials and cell sources such as bone marrow and peripheral blood samples. The selection of adipose tissue is based upon a number of factors including high cell density and its wide array of other cell types including precursor and immune cells that may be derived and developed as future products. Although the Company is currently focused on the development of cellular therapy products utilizing adipose derived mesenchymal cells, the platform is designed to be easily extendable to permit the acquisition and expansion of additional cellular derivatives from other biomaterials.

A significant amount of research, case studies and anecdotal evidence has been published over the past several decades concerning the study of cellular therapies for a wide range of diseases and maladies from ALS and Parkinson’s to wound healing and immunological support. The Company, recognizing that each new application for therapy approval requires a standalone clinical study, has refined its development strategy to initially encompass mild traumatic brain injury and immunosuppression as core targets for its development strategy. We focus our efforts on expanding our product pipelines based upon our intellectual property portfolio, collaborative development relationships, target market size, medical need, disease classification, and international licensing and partnering opportunities.
 
The completion, submission and approval of our validated manufacturing platform is the culmination of the Company’s development efforts. Validation of the manufacturing platform for the study has provided the Company with the opportunity to expand its efforts and resources on the further development of its downstream intellectual property. The objective is to provide deliverable commercial cell therapy products to address patient populations with large unmet medical needs such as brain injuries and conditions that include immunologic complications. The Company’s continuing efforts in the development of additional products includes an increased focus on the recruitment of collaborative partners and the extension of our existing manufacturing capabilities to development of other adipose tissue derivative and cellular/biomaterial combination products. Leveraging our repeatable processing platform provides the Company with contributable technology and capabilities to rapidly develop clinical studies, accumulate complementary scientific data and attract strong collaborative and developmental partners.
 
Our activities include supporting collaborations by providing our products and services (ACSelerate™ and ATCELL™) with the goal and expectation that our products and services become the basis for new cell based Regenerative Medicine and cellular therapy applications.
 
Part of this strategic approach to therapy product development is to design, develop and launch new products and services that rely on our core processing technology and leverage existing products and services. Examples of this approach are the use of the CELLECT® collection kit/ box and materials to collect fresh tissue for cellular therapy sample processing, use of our patented non-animal growth medium for cell culture and use of our storage medium for cryo-storage. Management is currently pursing collaborative product development agreements with healthcare institutions, universities, and other biotech companies.
 
2022 Therapy Pipeline
 
The Company has developed and refined its pipeline around its flagship cellular product, ATCell™, for clinical therapeutic use. The initiation of this pipeline strategy occurred with the filing, approval and commencement of its Post Concussion Syndrome Phase 1 clinical study. During this review process, the US FDA fully reviewed the Company’s manufacturing platform contained in the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control section of the Investigational New Drug (IND) submission. The Company’s filing included unpublished research of ATCell™ use in an animal model as well as a report covering its safety results from a pilot study that included the treatment of more than 80 patients that received one or more treatments with the ATCell™ product that resulted in no reported adverse events.

About ATCELL™
 
The Company has established and trademarked ATCELL™ as the brand name for its line of adipose derived stem cell products. ATCELL™ is a purified sample of adipose tissue derived from adipose tissue through our manufacturing processes that can be incubated and grown (cultured) to large quantities in cGMP conditions.
 ATCELL™ Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Cells Processed and characterized adipose derived cells created using the Company’s proprietary, validated and patented Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of its manufacturing platform and the Company’s ACSelerate™ patented cell culture media. Cell lines may also be custom created for patients desiring to store their cells for their own future use in Regenerative Medicine procedures, shipped “On Demand”. Customer samples are collected by the physician in an mini liposuction procedure and delivered to the Company’s facility utilizing the CELLECT® collection system and ACSelerate™ transport medium to conform to our validated quality control standards. The Company charges its customers a fee to process newly collected client tissue samples into cellular samples.
 
ATCELL’s repeatable sample manufacturing process is designed to comply with the requirements of FDA to produce highly consistent and validated cellular products necessary to achieve regulatory approval. The validation of our manufacturing process and quality control results are of great value in biomanufacturing and serve as the basis for approval and commercial product development.
 
The Company’s ATCELL™ cell lines are cultured in our patented ACSelerate™ cell culture media. All processed samples: tissue, cells, and research materials are made available for clinical study therapies, tissue transfer or sale to research institutions. All samples are tested for sterility, disease, lifespan, and population doubling rate (PDL). Cell morphology is confirmed by (i) flow cytometry (6 markers) and (ii) tri-lineage differentiation analysis using ACSelerate™ differentiation media. Each ATCELL™ line can be further processed and differentiated allowing the Company to provide genetically matched cell types. We believe this research methodology may provide opportunities for the Company’s ATCELL™ and ACSelerate™ products to become the building blocks of additional commercial application development.
 
The Company believes it can earn additional fees based upon storage and retrieval fees and for future product creation. Cell culturing and differentiation may be performed upon receipt of the raw tissue sample or at any time on a previously processed and cryopreserved tissue or master cell sample. ATCELL™ has shown that it is ideally suited for differentiation into additional cell types (bone, cartilage, etc.) utilizing our patented ACSelerate™ line of differentiation mediums.
 
The ATCELL™ processing, products and services are incorporated into multiple granted patents including the granted claim of: “Systems and Methods for the Digestion of Adipose Tissue Samples Obtained from a Client for Cryopreservation” US 10,154,664 issued December 18, 2018, and “Business Method for Collection, Processing, Cryogenic Storage and Distribution of a Biologic Sample Material” US Patent Number 10,014,079, issued July 3, 2018.

Tissue Processing and Storage Services:
 
ATGRAFT™– An adipose tissue (fat) collection, processing and storage solution used by cosmetic and plastic surgeons to provide their patients with multiple tissue transfer and storage options. The ATGRAFT™ service, through one liposuction procedure, allows individuals to prepare for multiple future cosmetic or regenerative procedures by using their own stored adipose tissue as natural biocompatible filler, or for multiple cellular therapy applications over time without the trauma of further liposuctions. Many physicians currently offering tissue transfer or “stem cell (SVF)” therapies are required to perform a concurrent tissue harvest for each transfer or procedure which increases the opportunities for infection at the harvest site and the development of long-term complications related to the formation of scar tissue (stroma) at the harvest site(s).

Tissue collected and transported in our CELLECT kits is monitored through the transportation process to assures the highest viability upon laboratory receipt. The CELLECT® system incorporates our ACSelerate–TR™ transport medium to support the health of the tissue during transport. The ability to support the health of the collected tissue using our proprietary material and services greatly enhances our highly consistent and repeatable manufacturing and processing protocol. The CELLECT® service is included in our granted patent “Business Method for Collection, Processing, Cryogenic Storage and Distribution of a Biologic Sample Material” US Patent Number 10,014,079, issued July 3, 2018.
 
American CryoStem is the first tissue bank to globally incorporate through its CELLECT® service the International Blood Banking identification, labeling and product identification coding system. This labeling system is an acceptable machine-readable labeling standard, product description, and bar-coding system for FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research under 21 CFR 606.12(c)13. American CryoStem conforms to this standard in its laboratory facility and all cellular and tissue products produced at the facility carry our W3750 ICCBBA facility identifier allowing any hospital, clinic, laboratory and regulator worldwide to identify the origin and obtain additional information on any sample produced at an American CryoStem laboratory facility. The Company requires use of this standard in all laboratories that license or utilize our technology.
 
ACSelerate™ Cell Culture Media Products – Manufactured patented cell culture media products for growing human stromal cells (including all cells found in human skin, fat and other connective tissue). Certain of the Company’s ACSelerate™ cell culture media lines are available in animal serum free, which may be suitable for human and therapeutic uses, or in a low serum version for application development and research purposes. The patented ACSelerate™ cell culture media line(s) were specifically developed to address increasing industry demand for fetal bovine serum-free cell culture products. The use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and other animal products in cellular therapy application development and manufacture raises concerns and generates debates within the scientific and regulatory community relating to potential human/animal cross-contamination. These same concerns may lead to additional expensive and expansive testing and documentation requirements with the FDA during the application and approval process for new cellular therapies manufactured with or containing animal or animal derived products. FDA concerns are evidenced in their Guidance’s and Guidelines regarding cellular therapy involving human cells, tissues and products (HCT/Ps) published and maintained by the FDA. Management believes that eliminating or greatly reducing FBS in cellular manufacturing, applications and products can eliminate or ease these scientific and regulatory concerns and may prove to be a winning strategy for cellular therapy application developers seeking FDA approval.
 
The Company entered into a licensing and manufacturing agreement with PeproTech (April 4, 2016) a life sciences company formed in 1988. PeproTech is the trusted source for the development and manufacturing of high quality cytokine products for the life-science and cell therapy markets. PeproTech has grown into a global enterprise with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in the US, and offices around the world. With over 2,000 products PeproTech has developed and refined innovative protocols to ensure quality, reliability and consistency. The licensed medium is marketed under both PeproTech’s PeproGrow and the Company’s ACSelerate MAX brands.
 
On August 2, 2011, the Company was issued US patent number 7,989,205 for “Cell Culture Media, Kits and Methods of Use.” The granted claims include media variations for cellular differentiation of ADSCs into osteoblasts (bone), chondrocytes (cartilage), adipocytes (fat), neural cells, and smooth muscles cells in both HSA medium grade and FBS (research) grade. This patent covers both non-GMP research grades and cGMP grades suitable for cell culture of adipose-derived stem cells. Additionally, on November 8, 2016, the Company was granted additional claims from the continuation U.S. Serial No. 13/194,900 issued as a new Patent Serial No. 9,487,755. Prior to the issuance the Company filed a continuation in part (CIP) containing additional claims related to our ongoing media development.
 
The Company supports its marketing efforts by making ATCELL™ samples available for research purposes and for internal product development through our collaborative and partnering programs. We believe these cell lines may be suitable for use by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research. We also believe that the Company’s ability to provide these materials for these research and development collaborators, partners and other third parties extends the Company’s ability to become a primary source of clinical grade materials and services necessary to support approved applications and treatments.

International Licensing Program – COVID RISK FACTOR
 
The development of our products could be disrupted and materially adversely affected in the future by a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease like the recent outbreak of COVID-19. For example, as a result of measures imposed by the governments in regions affected by COVID-19 businesses have been suspended due to quarantines or “stay at home” orders intended to contain this outbreak. Furthermore, many patients had concerns about making hospital and physician office visits for fear of contracting the virus. These factors may have direct adverse impact on our ability to enroll participants in our clinical trial programs. In addition, travel restrictions, stay-in-place orders and other measures including information control. specifically in Asian countries, such as China, imposed by governmental agencies and health organizations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect the citizenry, have had an adverse impact on the flow of information, goods and services between nations. The supply disruptions have resulted in shortages of goods and materials. This could also impact our ability to produce the products we need to conduct our clinical trials. In addition, these measures have resulted in delays to the regulatory process, which may also have an adverse impact on our business. We are still assessing our business plans and the impact COVID-19 may have on our ability to advance the development of our drug candidates or to raise financing to support the development of our drug candidates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our sector in particular.
 
The Company is aware many jurisdictions outside the US currently permit cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications. The Company has targeted these jurisdictions for licensing its technologies to local operators and facilities and receives numerous unsolicited international inquiries concerning the sale or licensing of our SOPs, culture medium products and tissue banking services for use in the Regenerative Medicine and Medical Tourism Markets. The Company believes that the inquiries to date are a result of the global boom in Medical Tourism, Regenerative and Personalized Medicine and the slow pace of approval of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications in the US. To address the Company’s sales, marketing and branding opportunities globally, the Company has included in its international licensing program metrics to vet potential partners and collaborators and their facilities. To date we have licensed our technologies in Hong Kong, China, and Thailand.

China
 On July 12, 2018 the Company announced the national launch of its ATGRAFTTM tissue collection, processing and storage technology by Baoxin Asia Pacific Biotechnology (Shenzhen) Co. Ltd. (“Baoxin”) in China. The Company’s management team traveled throughout south east China with the management and marketing team of Baoxin to present the ATGRAFTTM platform to leading plastic and cosmetic surgery hospitals in Shenzhen, Nanning, Guangzhou, Guangxi and Changsha. Additionally, Mr. Arnone and Mr. Dudzinski attended the signing of investment documents between Baoxin and Chinese government and Banking officials in Shenzhen, China as well as the official launch presentation and evening gala hosted by Baoxin in Shenzhen.
 The China launch activities were in support of the Company’s licensing and supply agreement with Baoxin, under which Baoxin agreed to pay the Company a minimum annual guarantee against a fixed fee per process and purchase certain necessary consumables from CRYO required for the collection, processing and storage of the collected adipose tissue. Under the terms of the Agreements signed in Fiscal 2018, the Company invested in and currently holds five percent (5%) of Baoxin shares. Additionally, Mr. Arnone and Mr. Dudzinski were elected to serve as Directors of Baoxin during their visit to Shenzhen, China. Mr. Arnone resigned as a board Member of Baoxin in 2019. Mr. Dudzinski continues to serve the Company’s interests as a board member of Baoxin.
 During Fiscal 2020 and 2021, due to the continuing effects of the COVID pandemic and associated government policies and regulations Baoxin suspended its processing activities. Baoxin is an emerging biotechnology company in China that has relied to date on investment to fund operation and build their facilities, as is typical for these types of companies. During 2020 and 2021, Baoxin developed a new state of the art facility with sizable clean rooms and biomaterial storage space. The facility was completed in February 2021 and officially opened in May of 2021. Unfortunately, due to the continued effects of COVID and the appearance of new variants Baoxin has been unable to restart operations and its marketing programs.

Regulatory Information 
 
On January 3, 2018, the Company received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA concerning its contract manufacturing services at its Monmouth Junction, NJ facility. The FDA informed the Company that the Agency determined that its autologous adipose derived cell product, ATCELL™ is a drug under current FDA regulations and guidance. The Company voluntary ceased shipment of its ATCell product within the United States in January of 2018. Since the Company’s initial response to the warning letter it spent considerable time and effort to comply with the concerns and observations highlighted in the letter. Specifically, the Company designed and filed it first Investigation New Drug Application with FDA which was approved on September 17, 2020. The Company implemented, qualified and validated its completely redesigned manufacturing new clean manufacturing space, SOPs and Quality Management program in its facility in Monmouth Junction, N.J. Our SOPs are the key to compliantly operating our tissue processing facility. In 2018 the Company hired a cGMP consultant to assist with the update of all SOP’s, data collection forms, Quality Control Program and laboratory operations to conform with cGMP in response to the observations made by FDA. To ensure delivery of the highest quality services, we incorporated into these SOPs, certain accreditation requirements of the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT-JACIE). The Company is planning to seek accreditation by one or more of the associations in the future.
 
The Company filed its final responses to FDA regarding the Warning Letter in early January of 2020. Based upon the Company’s IND approval and FDA policy, the final dispensation of the Warning Letter is on hold by the FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) pending completion of the study and the filing by the Company of the formal Biologics License Application.
 
In response to the Warning Letter and in preparation of the IND filing, the Company expanded its existing facilities and undertook a complete remediation of its laboratory operations in expectation of the (IND) filing with the FDA for the use of autologous adipose derived cells for the relief of inflammation associated with certain conditions resulting from mild traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) or concussive trauma. The Company also leased additional space, certified and validated a new Clean Room designed specifically for cellular expansion, medium filling and tissue processing. In addition, the Company retained consultants to assist its personnel in the review and re-validation of its operating procedures, equipment and processing methods as well as designing new procedures for upgraded and newly acquired laboratory operating and testing equipment. These new validated manufacturing methods and upgraded laboratory facility were reviewed by the FDA during the IND application process. Due to the construct of our core technologies, the FDA regulatory pathway enables the Company to “cross-reference” the Chemistry Manufacturing and Control (CMC) modules of the current study for use in subsequent new INF treatment applications.
 
The Company’s New Jersey laboratory facility is registered with the FDA (FEI 3008307548) as a processing and storage facility for Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue Based Products (HCT/Ps) since 2010. We have discussed our operations with the State of New Jersey Health Department and Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to ascertain any special regulations to which we may be subject. Based upon these discussions, and our use of a registered medical waste disposal company, we do not at this time have any special registrations or regulations for compliance with the State of New Jersey.
 
We have consistently endeavored to ensure that our processes, methodologies and procedures remain among the highest standards in the global tissue collection, processing and storage market. To this end, we have equipped ourselves with state-of-the-art quality processing and testing equipment, which we believe helps to ensure that every sample collected and processed is sterile (free from adventitious agents), viable and capable of significant cellular growth and expansion.
 
Quality Management
 
The Company’s quality management program attempts to ensure that during processing and testing of each adipose tissue, or cellular sample, the appropriate quality management tests and processing methodologies are performed, and the data is collected, recorded and reviewed by the laboratory management team. In 2018 the Company hired a Quality Control consultant to assist the Company in updating its Quality Control Program, laboratory processes, Sops, data collection, and laboratory, product and materials validation programs. The new system was completed, qualified and validated in 2019 and has been implemented in the new clean processing facility the Company qualified in 2019 to support our intended clinical studies.
 
Quality Management is a significant focus of clinical studies and is subject to both FDA regulation and guidance, as well as The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). ICH guidelines are applied by a growing number of global regulatory authorities. ICH’s mission is to achieve greater harmonization worldwide to ensure that safe, effective and high-quality medicines are developed, and registered and maintained in the most resource efficient manner whilst meeting high standards. Since October 2015, ICH has grown as an organization and now includes 19 International Members and 35 Observers. The FDA requires incorporation of the quality standard into clinical study and cGMP manufacturing and the Company has incorporated the relative requirements of these guidelines into both its approved IND and its cGMP manufacturing standard operating procedures as required. The Company employs this strategy in its efforts to accelerate regulatory approvals in the US.
 
Chain of Custody Control
 
Central to the individual sample testing is an unbroken chain of custody and tracking. Sample tracking begins with the creation of each CELLECT collection box. All samples, processing, quality management, batch, and storage documents and records, are coded with this unique number. All records and testing samples are cross referenced and verified as required by the standard operating procedures.

Testing Design and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
 
Testing methods are standardized and operate under a complete set of SOPs and Quality Management (QM) processes. All SOPs are designed to be in compliance with the US Food and Drug Administration’s regulations and guidance for aseptic processing. Strict QM is enforced to avoid and/or record any process deviations. In 2018 in response to the FDA letter the Company undertook a major reorganization and upgrade of all of its methods, SOPs, processes and facility to upgrade its facility from a registered tissue bank to a Biologic Drug Manufacturer. This update was completed concurrently with the validation and qualification of the Company’s new quality management system that was completed, validated and qualified in 2019.
Intellectual Property
 
From the Company’s formation, our strategy has been to invest time and capital in intellectual property protection. This strategy is intended to strengthen our Company’s foundation in any defensive or offensive legal challenge. In addition, we are developing our IP portfolio to ensure and enhance our business flexibility and allow us to gain favorable terms in potential future collaborative partnerships with third parties.

Strategically, the Company’s international licensees will maintain the branding of the Company’s services along the lines of the “Intel Inside” branding program.
 Qualified Licensees can quickly take advantage of the rapidly expanding opportunity to collect, process, store and culture individual regenerative cell samples for their clients with the comfort and confidence that they are providing services that have been developed to conform to US FDA standards. Core to the relationship is the developed proprietary and patent pending processing and laboratory operational methodologies contained in our Standard Operating Procedures, Training, and Continuous Quality Management, Testing Program, and Laboratory Operations manuals.
 Licensing programs may be initiated through a letter of intent (LOI) agreement between the Company and the prospective licensee. This LOI agreement is designed for due diligence and facility qualifications purposes. The Company receives an initial fee under the agreement which may or may not be credited toward future royalty payments. Following evaluation of the prospective licensee the Company will enter into a final Agreement which outlines all upfront fees, minimum royalties and consumable purchase obligations of the Licensee.
 Significant to our international development activities is the global expansion of the American CryoStem branded services and patented products, as well as the expansion of the Company’s services, technology and products as the core platform to implement cellular therapies and regenerative medicine.

During Fiscal 2020 and 2021, due to the continuing effects of the COVID pandemic and associated government policies and regulations Baoxin suspended its processing activities. Baoxin is an emerging biotechnology company in China that has relied to date on investment to fund operation and build their facilities, as is typical for these types of companies. During 2020 and 2021, Baoxin developed a new state of the art facility with sizable clean rooms and biomaterial storage space. The facility was completed in February 2021 and officially opened in May of 2021. Unfortunately, due to the continued effects of COVID and the appearance of new variants Baoxin has been unable to restart operations and its marketing programs.
