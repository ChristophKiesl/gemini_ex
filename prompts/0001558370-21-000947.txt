Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

​
Our Company
​
We were incorporated in Maryland on June 28, 2004. We are a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As of December 31, 2020, we had interests in 17 hotels (the “17 Hotels”). The 17 Hotels are comprised of 9,017 rooms, located in 8 states and in Washington, DC.
​
We are the premier steward of Long-Term Relevant Real Estate® (“LTRR®”) in the lodging industry. Our business is to acquire, own, asset manage and renovate or reposition hotels that we consider to be LTRR® in the United States, specifically hotels in urban, resort and destination locations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors and diverse economic drivers. As part of our ongoing portfolio management strategy, on an opportunistic basis, we may also selectively sell hotel properties that we do not believe meet our criteria of LTRR®. All but two (the Boston Park Plaza and the Oceans Edge Resort & Marina) of the 17 Hotels are operated under nationally recognized brands such as Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt, which are among the most respected and widely recognized brands in the lodging industry. Our two unbranded hotels are located in top urban and resort markets that have enabled them to establish awareness with both group and transient customers. Our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale hotels located in major convention, resort, destination and urban markets.
​
Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term management agreements with the TRS Lessee or its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, our third-party managers included: subsidiaries of Marriott International, Inc. or Marriott Hotel Services, Inc. (collectively “Marriott”), managers of six of the Company’s hotels; Crestline Hotels & Resorts (“Crestline”), Highgate Hotels L.P. and an affiliate (“Highgate”), Hilton Worldwide (“Hilton”) and Interstate Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“IHR”), each a manager of two of the Company’s hotels; and Davidson Hotels & Resorts (“Davidson”), Hyatt Corporation (“Hyatt”) and Singh Hospitality, LLC (“Singh”), each a manager of one of the Company’s hotels. 
​
As is typical of the lodging industry, we experience some seasonality in our business. Information regarding the seasonal patterns affecting our hotels is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
​
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business
​
In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a National Public Health Emergency, which led to significant cancellations, corporate and government travel restrictions and an unprecedented decline in hotel demand. As a result of these cancellations, restrictions and the health concerns related to COVID-19, we determined that it was in the best interest of our hotel employees and the communities in which our hotels operate to temporarily suspend operations at the majority of our hotels.

​
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended operations at 14 of the 17 Hotels during the first half of 2020, 12 of which have since resumed operations as of December 31, 2020:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
----------------------------------------------------+---+-----------------+---+-----------------
Hotel | ​ | Suspension Date | ​ | Resumption Date 
Oceans Edge Resort & Marina | ​ | March 22, 2020 | ​ | June 4, 2020 
Embassy Suites Chicago | ​ | April 1, 2020 | ​ | July 1, 2020 
Marriott Boston Long Wharf | ​ | March 12, 2020 | ​ | July 7, 2020 
Hilton New Orleans St. Charles | ​ | March 28, 2020 | ​ | July 13, 2020 
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile | ​ | April 6, 2020 | ​ | July 13, 2020 
JW Marriott New Orleans | ​ | March 28, 2020 | ​ | July 14, 2020 
Hilton San Diego Bayfront | ​ | March 23, 2020 | ​ | August 11, 2020 
Renaissance Washington DC | ​ | March 26, 2020 | ​ | August 24, 2020 
Hyatt Regency San Francisco | ​ | March 22, 2020 | ​ | October 1, 2020 
Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld® | ​ | March 20, 2020 | ​ | October 1, 2020 
The Bidwell Marriott Portland | ​ | March 27, 2020 | ​ | October 5, 2020 
Wailea Beach Resort | ​ | March 25, 2020 | ​ | November 1, 2020
Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile | ​ | March 27, 2020 | ​ | ​ 
Renaissance Westchester | ​ | April 4, 2020 | ​ | ​ 

​
Three of the 17 Hotels remained open throughout 2020: the Boston Park Plaza; the Embassy Suites La Jolla; and the Renaissance Long Beach. The hotels in operation during 2020 experienced a significant decrease in occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we, in conjunction with our third-party managers, reduced operating expenses to preserve liquidity by implementing stringent operational cost containment measures, including significantly reduced staffing levels, limited food and beverage offerings, elimination of non-essential hotel services and the temporary closure of various parts of the hotels. In addition, enhanced cleaning procedures and revised operating standards were developed and implemented. To preserve additional liquidity, we temporarily suspended both our stock repurchase program and our common stock quarterly dividend, and deferred a portion of our portfolio’s planned 2020 non-essential capital improvements.
​
While demand for our hotels remained stable during the first two months of 2020, COVID-19 and the related government and health official mandates in many markets in March through December virtually eliminated demand across our portfolio, resulting in a significant net loss recognized in 2020.
​
While a recovery timeline is highly uncertain, we expect to resume operations at our two remaining suspended hotels when there is sufficient market demand, which we anticipate may not occur until the second half of 2021. The extent of the effects of the pandemic on our business and the hotel industry at large, however, will ultimately depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, how quickly and successfully effective vaccines and therapies are distributed and administered, as well as the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and normal economic and operating conditions to resume.
​
Competitive Strengths
​
We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other owners of lodging properties:

● | High Quality Portfolio of Long-Term Relevant Real Estate®.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

​
Focus on Owning Long-Term Relevant Real Estate®. We believe that we will create lasting stockholder value through the active ownership of LTRR®. LTRR® consists of hotels that we believe possess unique attributes that are difficult to replicate, and most of all, whose locations are highly desirable and are relevant today and whose relevance will stand the test of time for generations to come. We believe that owning LTRR® provides superior long-term economics and reduces the risk of waning demand that often happens to undercapitalized and pedestrian hotels.
​
Presence in Key Markets. A cornerstone of LTRR® is location. We believe that our hotels are located in many of the most desirable long-term relevant markets with major and diverse demand generators and significant barriers to entry for new supply. All of the 17 Hotels are located in key gateway markets and unique resort and destination locations such as Boston, Chicago, Key West, Maui, New Orleans, Orlando, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco and Washington DC. Over time, we expect the revenues of hotels located in key gateway markets and unique resort and destination locations to generate superior long-term growth rates as compared to the average for U.S. hotels, as a result of stronger and more diverse economic drivers.
​

4




Nationally Recognized Brands and Established Independents. As noted above, all but two of the 17 Hotels are operated under nationally recognized brands. We believe that affiliations with strong brands and established independents improve the appeal of our hotels to a broad set of travelers and help to drive business to our hotels.
​
Recently Renovated Hotels. During the past five years, we invested $493.8 million in capital renovations throughout the 17 Hotels. We believe that these capital renovations have improved the competitiveness of our hotels and have helped to position our portfolio for future growth.
​

● | Significant Cash Position. As of December 31, 2020, we had total cash of $416.1 million, including $47.7 million of restricted cash. While the COVID-19 pandemic materially affected our hotels’ ability to generate cash from operations, our history of maintaining higher than typical cash balances enabled us to fund our business needs without raising additional capital through equity or debt issuances. Depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and any negative long-term impact it may have on travel, our cash position may further decline.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Flexible Capital Structure. We believe our capital structure provides us with significant financial flexibility to execute our strategy. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average term to maturity of our debt was approximately four years, and all of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates or had been swapped to fixed interest rates, except the $220.0 million non-recourse mortgage on the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. Including the effects of our interest rate swap agreements and the temporary increases in interest rates on our unsecured debt as stipulated in the unsecured debt amendments we entered into during 2020, our fixed-rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%. Including our variable-rate debt on the Hilton San Diego Bayfront based on the variable rate at December 31, 2020, the weighted average interest rate on our debt was 3.8%. For more information on the unsecured debt amendments we entered into during 2020, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition to our mortgage debt, as of December 31, 2020, we had two unsecured corporate-level term loans, and two series of senior unsecured corporate-level notes. We also have an undrawn $500.0 million credit facility. We currently believe this structure is appropriate for the operating characteristics of our business as it isolates risk and provides flexibility for various portfolio management initiatives, including the sale of individual hotels subject to existing debt.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Low Leverage. We believe that by maintaining appropriate debt levels, staggering maturity dates and maintaining a highly flexible capital structure, we will have lower capital costs than more highly leveraged companies, or companies with limited flexibility due to restrictive corporate-level financial covenants. Our low leverage capital structure not only minimizes the risk of potential value destructive consequences in periods of economic recession or global pandemics, but also provides us with significant optionality to create stockholder value through all phases of the operating cycle.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Strong Access to Low Cost Capital. As a publicly traded REIT, over the long-term, we may benefit from greater access to a variety of forms of capital as compared to non-public investment vehicles. In addition, over the long-term, we may benefit from a lower cost of capital as compared to non-public investment vehicles as a result of our investment liquidity, balance sheet optionality, professional management and portfolio diversification.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Seasoned Management Team. Each of our core disciplines, including asset management, acquisitions, finance and legal, are overseen by industry leaders with demonstrated track records.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Asset Management. Our asset management team is responsible for maximizing the long-term value of our real estate investments by achieving above average revenue and profit performance through proactive oversight of hotel operations. Our asset management team works with our third-party managers to drive property-level innovation, benchmarks best practices and aggressively oversees hotel management teams and property plans. We work with our operators to develop hotel-level “business plans,” which include positioning and capital investment plans. We believe that a proactive asset management program can help grow the revenues of our hotel portfolio and maximize operational and environmental efficiency by leveraging best practices and innovations across our various hotels, and by initiating well-timed and focused capital improvements aimed at improving the appeal of our hotels.
​
Acquisitions. Our acquisitions team is responsible for enhancing our portfolio quality and scale by executing well-timed acquisitions and dispositions that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on our investment dollars. We believe that our significant acquisition and disposition experience will allow us to continue to execute our strategy to redeploy capital from slower growth assets to LTRR® with higher long-term growth rates. Our primary focus is to acquire LTRR®. Depending on availability, we select the branding and operating partners for our hotels that we believe will lead to the highest returns and greatest long-term value. We also focus on disciplined capital recycling, and may selectively sell hotels that no longer fit our stated strategy, are unlikely to offer long-term returns in excess of our cost of capital, will achieve a sale price in excess of our internal valuation, or that have high risk relative to their anticipated returns.

5




​
Finance. We have a highly experienced finance team focused on minimizing our cost of capital and maximizing our financial flexibility by proactively managing our capital structure and opportunistically sourcing appropriate capital for growth, while maintaining a best in class disclosure and investor relations program. 
​
Legal. Our legal team is responsible for overseeing and supporting all Company-wide legal matters, including all legal matters related to corporate (including corporate oversight and governance), investment, asset management, design and construction, finance initiatives and litigation. We believe active and direct oversight of legal matters allows the Company the flexibility to pursue opportunities while minimizing legal exposure, protecting corporate assets, and ultimately maximizing stockholder returns.
​
Business Strategy
​
As demand for lodging generally fluctuates with the overall economy, we seek to own LTRR® that will maintain a high appeal with lodging travelers over long periods of time and will generate superior economic earnings materially in excess of recurring capital requirements. Our strategy is to maximize stockholder value through focused asset management and disciplined capital recycling, which is likely to include selective acquisitions and dispositions, while maintaining balance sheet flexibility and strength. Our goal is to maintain appropriate leverage and financial flexibility to position the Company to create value throughout all phases of the operating and financial cycles.
​
Competition
​
The hotel industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests in each of their markets. Competitive advantage is based on a number of factors, including location, physical attributes, service levels and reputation. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands in the luxury, upper upscale and upscale segments. Increased competition could harm our occupancy or revenues or may lead our operators to increase service or amenity levels, which may reduce the profitability of our hotels.
​
We believe that competition for the acquisition of hotels is widespread. We face competition from institutional pension funds, private equity investors, high net worth individuals, other REITs and numerous local, regional, national and international owners in each of our markets. Some of these entities may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able and willing to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. During times when we seek to acquire hotels, competition among potential buyers may increase the bargaining power of potential sellers, which may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or increase pricing. Similarly, during times when we seek to sell hotels, competition from other sellers may increase the bargaining power of the potential property buyers.
​
Management Agreements
​
All of the 17 Hotels are managed by third parties under management agreements with the TRS Lessee or its subsidiaries. The following is a general description of our third-party management agreements as of December 31, 2020.
​
Marriott. The following hotels are operated under management agreements with Marriott: JW Marriott New Orleans; Marriott Boston Long Wharf; Renaissance Long Beach; Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld®; Renaissance Washington DC; and Wailea Beach Resort. Our management agreements with Marriott require us to pay Marriott a base management fee equal to 3.0% of total revenue. Inclusive of renewal options and absent prior termination by either party, the Marriott management agreements expire between 2047 and 2078. Additionally, three of the management agreements require payment of an incentive fee of 20.0% of the excess of gross operating profit over a certain threshold; one management agreement requires payment of an incentive fee of 35.0% of the excess of gross operating profit over a certain threshold; one management agreement requires payment of a tiered incentive fee ranging from 15.0% to 20.0% of the excess of gross operating profit over certain thresholds; and one management agreement requires payment of an incentive fee of 10.0% of adjusted gross operating profit, capped at 3.0% of gross revenue. The management agreements with Marriott may be terminated earlier than the stated term if certain events occur, including the failure of Marriott to satisfy certain performance thresholds, a condemnation of, a casualty to, or force majeure event involving a hotel, the withdrawal or revocation of any license or permit required in connection with the operation of a hotel and upon a default by Marriott or us that is not cured prior to the expiration of any applicable cure periods. In certain instances, Marriott has rights of first refusal to either purchase or lease hotels, or to terminate the applicable management agreement in the event we sell the respective hotel.
​
Crestline. Our Embassy Suites Chicago and Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile hotels are operated under management agreements with Crestline. The management agreements with Crestline require us to pay Crestline a base management fee of 2.0% of gross revenue. Additionally, one of the management agreements requires us to pay an incentive fee of 10.0% of the excess of operating profit over a certain threshold, and the other management agreement does not require payment of an incentive fee. 

6




Inclusive of renewal options and absent prior termination by either party, both of the Crestline management agreements expire in 2032; however, we have the ability to terminate the Embassy Suites Chicago agreement without a termination fee at any time upon 60 days prior notice, and the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile management agreement without a termination fee upon sale of the hotel, performance test failure or Crestline default. 
​
Highgate. Our Boston Park Plaza and Renaissance Westchester hotels are operated under management agreements with Highgate. The management agreements with Highgate require us to pay Highgate a base management fee equal to 3.0% of gross revenue. Additionally, one of the management agreements requires us to pay an incentive fee of 15.0% of the excess of net operating income over a certain threshold; and one of the management agreements does not require payment of an incentive fee. The management agreements with Highgate do not include renewal options, and expire in 2022 and 2023, absent prior termination by either party. 
​
Hilton. Our Embassy Suites La Jolla and Hilton San Diego Bayfront hotels are operated under management agreements with Hilton. One of the management agreements with Hilton requires us to pay Hilton a base management fee of 1.75% of gross revenue, and the other management agreement requires us to pay Hilton a base management fee of 2.5% of total revenue. Additionally, one of the management agreements requires us to pay an incentive fee of 15.0% of the excess of operating cash flow over a certain percentage, and the other management agreement does not require payment of an incentive fee. The management agreements with Hilton do not include renewal options, and expire in 2026 and 2046, absent prior termination by either party. 
​
IHR. Our Hilton New Orleans St. Charles and The Bidwell Marriott Portland hotels are operated under management agreements with IHR. The management agreements with IHR require us to pay IHR a base management fee of 2.0% of gross revenue or total revenue, as applicable. Additionally, one of the management agreements provides IHR the opportunity to earn an incentive fee if certain operating thresholds are achieved, limited to 1.0% of the hotel’s total revenue, and one of the management agreements requires an incentive fee of 10.0% of the excess of net operating income over a certain threshold, limited to 1.5% of the total revenue for all the hotels managed by IHR for any fiscal year. Inclusive of renewal options and absent prior termination by either party, the IHR management agreements expire in 2033 and 2034; provided, however, we have the unilateral ability to terminate the IHR management agreements upon 60 days (Hilton New Orleans St. Charles) and 30 days (The Bidwell Marriott Portland) prior written notice. 
​
Davidson. Our Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile hotel is operated under a management agreement with Davidson. The management agreement with Davidson requires us to pay Davidson a base management fee of 2.5% of total revenue, and an incentive fee of 10.0% of the excess of net operating income over a certain threshold, limited to 1.5% of total revenue. The base and incentive management fees have an aggregate cap of 4.0% of total revenue. Inclusive of renewal options and absent prior termination by either party, the Davidson management agreement expires in 2029; however, we have the ability to terminate the agreement at any time without a termination fee upon 90 days prior written notice. 
​
Hyatt. Our Hyatt Regency San Francisco hotel is operated by Hyatt under an operating lease with economics that follow a typical management fee structure. Pursuant to the lease, Hyatt retains 3.0% of total revenue as a base management fee. The lease also provides Hyatt the opportunity to earn an incentive fee if gross operating profit exceeds certain thresholds. Under the operating lease, we are entitled to the payment of net income generated by the hotel, whereas Hyatt is solely and exclusively responsible for the operation of the hotel, including all costs and liabilities arising from such operation. The lease expires in 2050, and provides no renewal options. 
​
Singh. Our Oceans Edge Resort & Marina hotel is operated under a management agreement with Singh. The management agreement with Singh requires us to pay Singh a base management fee of 3.0% of gross revenue, and an incentive fee of 10.0% of adjusted net operating income, capped at 1.5% of gross revenue. The Singh management agreement provides no renewal options, and expires in 2027, absent prior termination by either party; however, we have the ability to terminate the agreement at any time without a termination fee upon 30 days prior written notice. 
​
The existing management agreements with Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt require the manager to furnish chain services that are generally made available to other hotels managed by that operator. Costs for these chain services are reimbursed by us. Such services include: the development and operation of computer systems and reservation services; management and administrative services; marketing and sales services; human resources training services; and such additional services as may from time to time be more efficiently performed on a national, regional or group level.
​
Franchise Agreements
​
As of December 31, 2020, seven of the 17 Hotels were operated subject to franchise agreements. Franchisors provide a variety of benefits to franchisees, including nationally recognized brands, centralized reservation systems, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness, training of personnel and maintenance of operational quality at hotels across the brand system.

​
The following table sets forth the expiration dates of our hotel franchise agreements:
​

​ | ​ 
----------------------------------------------------+------------------
Embassy Suites Chicago | October 26, 2024 
The Bidwell Marriott Portland | October 26, 2024 
Embassy Suites La Jolla | May 17, 2026 
Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile | January 19, 2027 
Renaissance Westchester | February 24, 2027
Hilton New Orleans St. Charles | May 31, 2028 
Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile | June 3, 2039 

​
The franchise agreements generally specify management, operational, record-keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which our subsidiary, as the franchisee, must comply. The franchise agreements obligate the subsidiary to comply with the franchisors’ brand standards and requirements with respect to training of operational personnel, safety, insurance coverages, services and products ancillary to guest room services, display of signage and the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas. The franchise agreements for our hotels require that we reserve up to 5.0% of the gross revenues of the hotels into a reserve fund for capital expenditures.
​
The franchise agreements also provide for termination at the franchisor’s option upon the occurrence of certain events, including failure to pay royalties and fees, failure to perform other obligations under the franchise license, bankruptcy, abandonment of the franchise or a change in control. The subsidiary that is the franchisee is responsible for making all payments under the franchise agreements to the franchisors; however, the Company guaranties certain obligations under a majority of the franchise agreements.
​
Tax Status
​
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 859 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2004. Under current federal income tax laws, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders each year in order to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement. While REITs enjoy certain tax benefits relative to C corporations, as a REIT we may still be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. We may also be subject to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income.
​
Taxable REIT Subsidiary
​
Subject to certain limitations, a REIT is permitted to own, directly or indirectly, up to 100% of the stock of a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. A TRS is a fully taxable corporation that may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by us. A TRS may perform activities such as development, and other independent business activities that may be prohibited to a REIT. A hotel REIT is permitted to own a TRS that leases hotels from the REIT, rather than requiring the lessee to be an unaffiliated third party, provided certain conditions are satisfied. However, a hotel leased to a TRS still must be managed by an unaffiliated third party in the business of managing hotels because a TRS may not directly or indirectly operate or manage any hotels or provide rights to any brand name under which any hotel is operated. The TRS provisions are complex and impose certain conditions on the use of TRSs to assure that TRSs are subject to an appropriate level of federal corporate taxation.
​
We and the TRS Lessee have made a joint election with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the TRS Lessee to be treated as a TRS. A corporation of which a qualifying TRS owns, directly or indirectly, more than 35% of the voting power or value of the corporation’s stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, no more than 20% of the value of our assets may consist of securities of one or more TRS, and no more than 25% of the value of our assets may consist of the securities of TRSs and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test. The 75% asset test generally requires that at least 75% of the value of our total assets be represented by real estate assets, cash, or government securities.
​
The rent that we receive from a TRS attributable to leases of “qualified lodging facilities” qualifies as “rents from real property” as long as the property is operated on behalf of the TRS by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating “qualified lodging facilities” for any person unrelated to us and the TRS (an “eligible independent contractor”). A “qualified lodging facility” is a hotel, motel or other establishment in which more than one-half of the dwelling units are used on a transient basis. A “qualified lodging facility” does not include any facility where wagering activities are conducted. A “qualified lodging facility” includes customary amenities and facilities operated as part of, or associated with, the lodging facility as long as such amenities and facilities are customary for other properties of a comparable size and class owned by other unrelated owners.
​

8




We have formed the TRS Lessee as a wholly owned TRS. We lease each of our hotels to the TRS Lessee or one of its subsidiaries. These leases provide for a base rent plus variable rent based on occupied rooms and departmental gross revenues. These leases must contain economic terms which are similar to a lease between unrelated parties. If they do not, the IRS could impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between the TRS Lessee and us or our tenants that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. We believe that all transactions between us and the TRS Lessee are conducted on an arm’s-length basis. 
​
The TRS Lessee has engaged eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels it leases from the Operating Partnership.
​
Ground, Building and Airspace Lease Agreements
​
At December 31, 2020, two of the 17 Hotels are subject to ground (the Hilton San Diego Bayfront) and building (the Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile) leases with unaffiliated parties that cover all of their respective properties. The JW Marriott New Orleans is subject to an airspace lease that applies only to certain balcony space fronting Canal Street that is not integral to the hotel’s operations. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining terms of these ground, building and airspace leases (including renewal options) range from approximately 23 to 77 years. These leases generally require us to make rental payments and payments for all or portions of costs and expenses, including real and personal property taxes, insurance and utilities associated with the leased property.
​
Any proposed sale of a property that is subject to a ground, building or airspace lease or any proposed assignment of our leasehold interest as lessee under the ground, building or airspace lease may require the consent of the applicable lessor. As a result, we may not be able to sell, assign, transfer or convey our interest in any such property in the future absent the consent of the ground, building or airspace lessor, even if such transaction may be in the best interests of our stockholders. 
​
One of the leases prohibits the sale or conveyance of the hotel by us to another party without first offering the lessor the opportunity to acquire our interest in the associated hotel upon the same terms and conditions as offered by us to the third party. The same lease also allows us the option to acquire the building lessor’s interest in the building lease subject to certain notice and process provisions. From time to time, we evaluate our options to purchase the lessors’ interests in the leases. 
​
Corporate Office
​
We currently lease our headquarters located at 200 Spectrum Center Drive, 21st Floor, Irvine, California 92618 from an unaffiliated third party. We occupy our headquarters under a lease that terminates on August 31, 2028.
​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of February 1, 2021, we had 40 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of the hotels are employees of the management companies engaged by the TRS Lessee or its subsidiaries to operate such hotels.
​
In March 2020, we temporarily closed our corporate office due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our employees began to work remotely. We provided various office supplies and resources to our employees as needed to allow them to perform their work remotely. While our office currently remains closed, our employees may, at times, work from the office. We have implemented COVID-19 protection protocols in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our corporate office. All of our employees have received training on these protocols, and are required to sign an acknowledgement of such protocols prior to returning to the corporate office.
​
Our employees are vital to the success of our Company. We place a very high emphasis on maintaining positive relations with all of our employees and strive to create an inspiring and inclusive work environment where our employees feel motivated and empowered to produce exceptional results for the Company. Our capital resource objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining and incentivizing our employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have designed our compensation and benefits programs to provide a balanced and effective reward structure, including:

● | Subsidized medical, dental and vision insurance;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Life and disability insurance;
--+-------------------------------


● | Stock grant program;
--+---------------------


● | 401(k) savings and retirement plan with Company Safe Harbor contribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Profit sharing plan; and
--+-------------------------


● | Gym membership.
--+----------------

We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled employees throughout our Company. We frequently benchmark our compensation and benefits package against those in both our industry and in similar disciplines.

​
We are committed to maintaining a work culture that treats all employees fairly and with respect, promotes inclusivity and provides equal opportunities for advancement based on merit. At December 31, 2020, females constituted approximately 40% of our workforce, and ethnic and racial minorities constituted approximately 15% of our workforce. We intend to continue using a combination of targeted recruiting, talent development and internal promotion strategies to expand the diversity of our employee base across all roles and functions. 
​
We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment. Our employees have multiple avenues available through which concerns or inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline. All concerns or reports of inappropriate behavior are promptly investigated with appropriate action taken to address such concerns or behavior.
​
Environmental, Social and Governance Matters (“ESG”)
​
We are committed to ensuring environmental and social initiatives are part of our operating and investment strategies. We continuously seek opportunities to invest in renovations, implement initiatives intended to reduce energy, water and waste impacts, enhance the overall environment and well-being of guests and associates at our properties, and improve the local communities in which we conduct business or own hotels. As owners of LTRR®, we take a holistic view in investing in our assets, balancing the best interests of our stockholders, the environment, our employees, the hotel associates and the communities in which we operate. As our board of directors recognizes the importance of an effective sustainability strategy on our operations and returns, the board of directors has assigned the board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with overseeing the strategy, policies and implementation of our ESG program.
​
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to the risks associated with the physical effects of climate change, which can include more frequent or severe storms, hurricanes, flooding, droughts and fires, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our hotels. While we are not directly involved in the operation of our properties or other activities that could produce meaningful levels of greenhouse gas emissions, we do control the capital invested in our hotels and have invested in initiatives aimed at reducing the levels of greenhouse gas emissions at our properties, such as LED lighting retrofits, low-flow plumbing fixture installations and building system upgrades. We are also installing bulk amenity dispensers in our hotels to reduce waste. Additionally, on an annual basis, we publish an environmental and sustainability report to monitor the carbon footprint and emissions at our hotels, and compare our energy, carbon, water and waste performance to the targets we announced in our 2019 Sustainability Report. 
​
Environmental Reviews
​
Environmental reviews have been conducted on all of our hotels. From time to time, our secured lenders have requested environmental consultants to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments on many of our properties. In certain instances, these Phase I assessments relied on older environmental assessments prepared in connection with prior financings. Phase I assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination of properties based generally upon site inspections, facility personnel interviews, historical information and certain publicly available databases. Phase I assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties. In addition, material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may arise after the Phase I assessments are completed, or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liabilities.
​
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on the property. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, a person that arranges for the disposal or transports for disposal or treatment of a hazardous substance at another property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released into the environment at that property. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of our properties, we or the TRS Lessee, as the case may be, may be potentially liable for such costs. Although we have tried to mitigate environmental risk through insurance, this insurance may not cover all or any of the environmental risks we encounter.
​
We have provided customary unsecured indemnities to certain lenders and buyers of our properties, including in particular, environmental indemnities. We have performed due diligence on the potential environmental risks, including obtaining an independent environmental review from outside environmental consultants. These indemnities obligate us to reimburse the indemnified parties for damages related to environmental matters. There is generally no term or damage limitation on these indemnities; however, if an environmental matter arises, we could have recourse against other previous owners or a claim against its environmental insurance policies.

​
ADA Regulation
​
Our properties must comply with various laws and regulations, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA; however, noncompliance with the ADA could result in capital expenditures, the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
​
Inflation
​
Inflation may affect our expenses, including, without limitation, by increasing costs such as labor, food, taxes, property and casualty insurance, borrowing costs and utilities.
