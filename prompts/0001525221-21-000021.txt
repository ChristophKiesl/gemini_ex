ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

On January 23, 2020, Era Group Inc. (“Era”), Ruby Redux Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Era (“Merger Sub”) and Bristow Group Inc. (“Old Bristow”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended on April 22, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”). On June 11, 2020, the merger (the “Merger”) contemplated by the Merger Agreement was consummated and Merger Sub merged with and into Old Bristow, with Old Bristow continuing as the surviving corporation and as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Era. Following the Merger, Era changed its name to Bristow Group Inc., and Old Bristow changed its name to Bristow Holdings U.S. Inc.
Unless the context indicates otherwise: (i) the terms “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us,” “Bristow Group,” “Bristow,” the “Company” and “Combined Company” refer to the entity currently known as Bristow Group Inc. and formerly known as Era Group Inc., together with its subsidiaries; (ii) “Old Bristow” refers to the entity formerly known as Bristow Group Inc. and now known as Bristow Holdings U.S. Inc., together with its subsidiaries; and (iii) “Era” refers to Era Group Inc. (currently known as Bristow Group Inc., the parent of the Combined Company) and its subsidiaries prior to consummation of the Merger. “Common Stock” refers to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Bristow Group. The Company’s fiscal year ended on March 31, 2021 and we refer to fiscal years based on the end of such period. Therefore, the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 is referred to as “fiscal year 2021”. Bristow Group’s principal executive office is located at 3151 Briarpark Drive, Suite 700, Houston, Texas 77042, and its telephone number is (713) 267-7600. Bristow Group’s website address is www.bristowgroup.com. The reference to Bristow Group’s website is not intended to incorporate the information on the website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
On May 11, 2019 (the “Petition Date”), Old Bristow and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”) seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). On August 1, 2019, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court their Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization, and on August 20, 2019, the Debtors filed their Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (as further modified on August 22, 2019, the “Amended Plan”) and the related Disclosure Statement (as further modified on August 22, 2019, the “Amended Disclosure Statement”). On October 8, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Amended Disclosure Statement and confirming the Amended Plan. The effective date of the Amended Plan (the “Effective Date”) occurred on October 31, 2019 at which point the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. Upon Old Bristow’s emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, Old Bristow adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 852, “Reorganizations” (“ASC 852”), which resulted in Old Bristow becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes on the Effective Date. 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to:
•“Predecessor” refer to Old Bristow on and prior to October 31, 2019; and
•“Successor” refer to the reorganized Old Bristow on and after November 1, 2019 until completion of the Merger
and after completion of the Merger refer to the Combined Company.
General    
Bristow Group Inc. is the leading global provider of vertical flight solutions. We primarily provide aviation services to a broad base of major integrated, national and independent energy companies. We also provide commercial search and rescue (“SAR”) services in multiple countries and public sector SAR services in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) on behalf of the Maritime & Coastguard Agency (“MCA”). Additionally, we offer fixed wing transportation and other aviation related solutions. Our oil and gas customers charter our helicopters primarily to transport personnel to, from and between onshore bases and offshore production platforms, drilling rigs and other installations.
Our core business of providing aviation services to leading global energy companies and public and private sector SAR services provides us with geographic and customer diversity which helps mitigate risks associated with a single market or customer. We currently have customers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Guyana, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Spain, Suriname, Trinidad, the U.K and the United States (“U.S.”).
In certain countries that limit foreign ownership of aviation companies and where we believe it is beneficial to access the local market for aviation support, we conduct our operations through subsidiaries, strategic alliances with foreign partners or through joint ventures with local shareholders. These arrangements, that combine a local ownership interest with Bristow’s experience in providing aviation services to the offshore energy industry, have allowed us to expand operations while diversifying risk.
Markets, Segment and Seasonality 
Global demand for helicopters in support of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production is affected by the offshore exploration and production. The activity levels are affected by prevailing and anticipated oil and gas prices, price volatility all of which influence capital spending decisions by our customers. Historically, the prices for oil and gas and, consequently, the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, have been volatile and subject to a variety of factors beyond our control, including but not limited to:
•customer assessments of offshore drilling prospects compared with land-based opportunities, including oil sands and shale formations; 
•customer assessments of cost, geological opportunity and political stability in host countries; 
•worldwide supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; 
•the price and availability of alternative fuels;
•the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;
•the level of production of non-OPEC countries; 
•the relative exchange rates for the U.S. dollar; and 
•various U.S. and international government policies regarding exploration and development of oil and gas reserves.
Aviation services, the single segment in which we conduct our business, is deployed out of four regions: Europe Caspian, Africa, Americas and Asia Pacific. The current principal markets for our aviation services to the offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production industry are in Brazil, Canada, Guyana, Nigeria, Norway, Suriname, Trinidad, the U.K and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we currently have customers in Australia, Chile, Colombia, India, Mexico and Spain.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, approximately 72% of our total revenues were derived from oil and gas services, including emergency response services, provided to customers primarily engaged in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production activities and U.S. government agencies that oversee these activities. Accordingly, our results of operations are, to a large extent, tied to the level of offshore exploration, development and production activity by oil and gas companies. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, approximately 20% of our total revenues were derived from U.K. SAR services, and approximately 8% were derived from fixed wing and other services.
Europe Caspian
We are one of the largest providers of aviation services in the North Sea, where there are harsh weather conditions and geographically concentrated offshore facilities. Our North Sea operations are subject to seasonality as drilling activity is lower during the winter months due to harsh weather and shorter days. Our oil and gas customers in this region are primarily international, independent and major integrated energy companies.
U.K. Markets. We provide offshore aviation services to a number of energy companies operating in the U.K. region of the North Sea. We also provide emergency response services through the U.K. SAR contract with the Department of Transport (“DfT”) servicing the public sector SAR needs for all of the U.K. on behalf of the MCA. We also own a controlling stake in the Humberside Airport in Kirmington, United Kingdom (the “Humberside Airport”) where we conduct certain of our SAR operations from a base location at the Humberside Airport.
Norway. We provide offshore aviation services to a number of energy companies operating in the Norwegian North Sea.
Americas
We are one of the largest providers of aviation services in North America with a strong presence in a number of Latin American countries. Our operations in the Americas are subject to seasonality where fewer hours of daylight in the fall and winter months may result in fewer flight hours.
U.S. Markets. We are one of the largest providers of aviation services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which is a major offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production region and one of the largest oil and gas aviation markets in the world. Our client base in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico consists primarily of international, independent and major integrated energy companies and the U.S. government. In general, the months of December through February in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year. Additionally, June through November is tropical storm season in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. During a tropical storm, we are unable to operate in the area of the storm, however, flight activity may increase immediately before and after a storm due to the evacuation and return of offshore workers.
Brazil. Brazil has one of the largest deepwater offshore exploration, development and production areas in the world. We currently operate from a network of bases strategically located in Brazil providing aviation services to offshore platforms.
Guyana. With numerous ongoing offshore exploration and development operations, Guyana is becoming one of the largest deepwater offshore exploration sites in the region. We provide offshore aviation transportation services and SAR services.
Trinidad. For over a century, Trinidad has had considerable oil and gas exploration activity on land and in shallow waters. We provide offshore aviation transportation services and SAR services to our customers in the region.
Latin America, Other. In addition to our operations in Brazil and Guyana, we operate helicopters in Suriname, and we lease helicopters and provide technical support to air operators in Chile and Mexico. In Colombia, we own a 75% interest in Sicher Helicopters SAS (“Sicher”), a provider of helicopter services to Colombia’s oil and gas market.
Canada. We own a 25% voting interest and a 40% economic interest in Cougar Helicopters Inc. (“Cougar), a major aviation services provider in Canada. Cougar’s operations are primarily focused on serving the offshore oil and gas industry off Canada’s Atlantic coast and in the Arctic.
Africa
Nigeria. We are the largest provider of aviation services to the offshore energy industry in Nigeria where the market place for our services is predominantly concentrated in the oil rich shallow waters of the Niger Delta area and in support of deepwater exploration. We also provide fixed wing services in the Africa region offering end-to-end transportation services principally for oil and gas industry customers. Operations in Nigeria are subject to seasonality as the Harmattan, a dry and dusty trade wind, blows between the end of December and the middle of February. At times when the heavy amount of dust in the air severely limits visibility, our aircraft are unable to operate.
Egypt. We own a 25% interest in Petroleum Air Services (“PAS”), an Egyptian corporation that provides helicopter and fixed wing transportation to the offshore energy industry as well as spare fixed wing capacity chartered to tourism operators in Egypt.
Asia Pacific
Australia. We own a regional fixed wing operator through a consolidated affiliate, Capiteq Limited (“Airnorth”), based in Darwin, North Territory, Australia, focused on providing both charter and scheduled services targeting the energy and mining industries in Northern and Western Australia as well as international services to Dili, Timor-Leste.
India. We lease helicopters and provide technical support to an operator serving the offshore oil and gas industry.
Equipment and Services 
We own and operate three classes of helicopters:
•Heavy helicopters, which have twin engines and a typical passenger capacity of 16 to 19, are primarily used in support of the deepwater offshore energy industry, frequently in harsh environments or in areas with long distances from shore, such as those in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and the North Sea. Heavy helicopters are also used to support SAR operations.
•Medium helicopters, which have twin engines and a typical passenger capacity of 12, are primarily used to support the offshore energy industry, SAR operations, utility services and corporate uses.
•Light helicopters, which may have single or twin engines and a typical passenger capacity of four to seven, are used to support a wide range of activities, including the offshore energy industry, utility services and corporate uses.
As of March 31, 2021, our total fleet consisted of 247 aircraft, of which 234 were helicopters. Our helicopters consist of 93 heavy helicopters, 93 medium helicopters, 18 light twin engine helicopters and 30 light single engine helicopters. Our fleet also includes 11 fixed wing aircraft and two unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAV”). 
The following table identifies the types of aircraft that comprise our fleet and the number of those aircraft in our fleet as of March 31, 2021.

The management of our fleet involves a careful evaluation of the expected demand for helicopter services across global markets and the types of helicopters needed to meet this demand. As offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production moves to deeper water, more heavy and medium helicopters and newer technology helicopters may be required. Our orders and options to purchase helicopters are primarily for heavy helicopters. These capital commitments reflect our effort to meet customer demand for helicopters suitable for the deepwater market. 
Heavy and medium helicopters fly longer distances at higher speeds and can carry heavier payloads than light helicopters and are usually equipped with sophisticated avionics permitting them to operate in more demanding weather conditions and difficult climates. Heavy and medium helicopters are most commonly used for crew changes on large offshore production facilities and drilling rigs servicing the oil and gas industry and for SAR operations. See “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report for discussion on our bases and operating facilities.
Aviation Operating Certificates 
Globally, we provide and operate aircraft under contracts using an Air Operator’s Certificate (“AOC”), typically issued by the relevant country’s applicable regulatory agency. In certain markets, local regulation may require us to partner with another operator, through an alliance or joint venture, who maintains an AOC compliant with the local regulatory requirements. For operating contracts, we are required to provide a complete support package including flight crews, helicopter maintenance and management of flight operations. When we lease helicopters to other operators, our customers generally handle the operational support although in a few instances we do provide technical support, personnel and/or training.
As of March 31, 2021, we retained 13 AOC’s in 12 different countries to facilitate our operations.
Customers and Contractual Arrangements
Our principal customers in the markets in which we operate are international, independent and major integrated energy companies and government agencies. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 63% of operating revenues, and the combined revenues from Dft, Equinor ASA and ConocoPhillips Co. accounted for 35% of our operating revenues.
We charter the majority of our helicopters primarily through master service agreements, subscription agreements, day-to-day charter arrangements, fixed-term noncancelable contracts and dry-leases. Master service agreements and subscription agreements typically require a fixed monthly fee plus incremental payments based on flight hours flown. These agreements have fixed terms ranging from one month to five years and generally may be canceled without penalty upon 30-365 days’ notice and may also include escalation provisions allowing annual rate increases. Customarily, these contracts do not commit our customers to acquire specific amounts of services or minimum flight hours and permit our customers to decrease the number of helicopters under contract with a corresponding decrease in the fixed monthly payments without penalty. Day-to-day charter arrangements require either a rate for each hour flown with a minimum number of hours to be charged or a daily fixed fee plus an hourly rate based on hours flown. The rate structure, as it applies to our contracts with oil and gas customers, typically contains terms that limit our exposure to changes in fuel costs. 
Our fixed wing services are generally provided through scheduled charter service or regular public transport service. We also provide charter services to customers on an “ad hoc” basis, which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter contract duration. Regular public transport service is provided through established daily or weekly flight schedules and is based upon individual ticket sales to customers.
Our leasing customers are typically other helicopter operators that operate our helicopters under their AOCs and retain the operating risk. Leases generally run from one to five years and may contain early cancellation provisions. Under these leases, we may provide only the equipment or provide additional services such as logistical and maintenance support, training services and flight and maintenance crews.
Competitive Conditions
The aviation services industry is highly competitive throughout the world. Customers tend to rely heavily on existing relationships and seek operators with established safety records and knowledge of the operating environment. In most instances, customers charter aircraft on the basis of competitive bidding, and typically an operator must have an acceptable safety record, demonstrated reliability and suitable equipment to bid for work. Upon bidders meeting these criteria, customers typically make their final choice based on operational experience, helicopter preference, aircraft availability, the quality and location of operating bases, customer service, professional reputation and price. Incumbent operators typically have a competitive advantage in the bidding process based on their relationship with the client, knowledge of the site characteristics and existing facilities to support the operations. In addition, while not the predominant practice, customers may also fulfill their needs by establishing their own flight departments or by facilitating the entry of a new operator in the regions where we operate.
Globally, our primary competitors are Babcock Mission Critical Services Offshore, CHC Group LLC, NHV Group and PHI, Inc. (“PHI”). We may also face competition from a number of smaller operators which vary by region.
Human Capital Management
With over seven decades of operations, we are one of the largest and longest-serving helicopter operators in the world, with a reputation for operational excellence. Our employees are some of the most highly regarded experts in vertical flight solutions. We prepare our employees for success through training, competitive benefits packages, and career development. We believe the best way to attract and retain top talent is to invest in our people through creating safe work environments, employee training and multi-level engagement to support their success. We seek qualified candidates who are aligned with our commitment to safety and other core values of integrity, passion, teamwork and progress. Our areas of focus for human capital management are:
Health and Safety — Safety is our number one core value and highest operational priority. Our pilots, maintenance technicians and support personnel are committed to our mission to provide safe, efficient and reliable aviation services. We initiated our industry-leading safety program, Target Zero, and are one of three founding members of HeliOffshore, an organization dedicated to collaboration across the offshore helicopter industry to improve safety around the world.
During fiscal year 2021, we achieved our target of zero air accidents. Additionally, we believe in keeping everyone safe and well, which includes doing our part to safeguard our physical and mental well-being. We currently have global resources in place to support mental health including an employee well-being portal that provides information and support channels for navigating stress and access to counseling and mental health professionals for all our employees around the world. In response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken a number of steps to help protect the health and well-being of our workforce and communities, including the implementation of flexible work schedules, incremental paid time off for employees experiencing symptoms and augmenting safety operational procedures to prevent workplace and passenger exposure.
Training and Development — We are committed to elevating our employees. All of our employees are required to take periodic trainings that promote the commitment to our core values. Our pilots and mechanics are required to take the latest trainings to ensure they are equipped to operate our aircraft with the best knowledge and experience. Our licensed professionals are afforded the opportunity for continuing education in their fields of expertise.
Compensation and Benefits — We offer competitive market-based compensation and benefits for the markets in which we operate. Competitive programs are critical to the well-being of our employees and their families, as well as secure the retention and business continuity. Global benefit offerings include major medical, life, retirement/pension, employee well-being support akin to employee assistance programs in addition to local offerings that vary by country market.
Bristow Uplift — We are committed to ensuring responsible operations in the communities in which we live and work. Through Bristow Uplift, we align business practices with social investments to make a positive impact and build strong community relationships that will make a positive difference in these communities. Bristow Uplift makes a positive difference, builds strong community relationships, and creates long-term value for our business. We have organized Bristow Uplift into five pillars supporting: Education, the Underserved, Health and Wellness, Diversity, and Sustainability. Bristow also matches employee donations to philanthropic organizations around the world. Through these efforts, we support building strong community relationships through the causes that are most important to our employees, ultimately creating long-term value for our business.
As of March 31, 2021, we employed 3,167 individuals, including 833 pilots and 824 mechanics. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
As of March 31, 2021, approximately 55% our employees were covered by union or other collective bargaining agreements. Negotiations over annual salary or other labor matters could result in higher personnel or other costs or increased operational restrictions or disruptions. Furthermore, a failure to reach an agreement on certain key issues could result in strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages.

The CAA regulates our U.K. flight operations and exercises jurisdiction over personnel, aircraft, ground facilities and certain technical aspects of those operations. The CAA often imposes improved safety standards. Under the Licensing of Air Carriers Regulations 1992, it is unlawful to operate any aircraft for hire within the U.K. unless such aircraft are approved by the CAA. Changes in U.K. statutes or regulations, administrative requirements or their interpretation may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or on our ability to continue operations in the U.K.
We are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, which creates criminal offenses for bribery and failing to prevent bribery. We are also subject to new U.K. corporate criminal offenses for failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion pursuant to the Criminal Finances Act 2017, which imposes criminal liability on a company where it has failed to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by a person associated with us.
We are obligated to comply with U.K. and Export Controls and Economic Sanctions. U.K. and regulations that may restrict the export of designated items to certain persons or destinations.  A variety of penalties, both criminal and civil, may be imposed for breaches of these regulations.
Norway
Our operations in the Norway are subject to E.U. statutes and regulations as Norway is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and signatory to the European Common Aviation Area Agreement (ECAA). We carry persons and property in our aircraft pursuant to an operating license issued by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority. The holder of an operating license must meet the ownership and control requirements criteria of Regulation (EC) 1008/2008, as amended and incorporated into Norwegian law. The company through which we conduct operations in Norway must be majority owned and controlled by E.U. nationals.
United States
As a certified air carrier, our U.S. operations are subject to regulations under the Federal Aviation Act, regulations of the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and other laws. We carry persons and property in our helicopters under an air taxi Certificate granted by the FAA. The FAA regulates our U.S. flight operations and, in this respect, exercises jurisdiction over personnel, aircraft, ground facilities and certain technical aspects of our operations. The DOT can review our economic fitness to continue our operations at any time and if a substantial change occurs to our management, ownership or capital structure, among other things. The National Transportation Safety Board is authorized to investigate any aircraft accidents and to recommend improved safety standards. Our U.S. operations are also subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934 because we use radio facilities in our operations.
Under the Federal Aviation Act, it is unlawful to operate certain aircraft for hire within the U.S. unless such aircraft are registered with the FAA and the FAA has issued an operating certificate to the operator. As a general rule, aircraft may be registered under the Federal Aviation Act only if the aircraft are owned or controlled by one or more citizens of the U.S. An operating certificate may be granted only to a citizen of the U.S. For purposes of these requirements, a corporation is deemed to 
be a citizen of the U.S. if no less than 75% of its voting interests are owned or controlled by U.S. citizens, its president is a U.S. citizen, two-thirds or more of the directors are U.S. citizens and it is under the actual control of U.S. citizens. If persons other than U.S. citizens should come to own or control more than 25% of our voting interest or if any of the other requirements are not met, we have been advised that our aircraft could be subject to deregistration under the Federal Aviation Act, and we might lose our ability to operate within the U.S. Deregistration of our aircraft for any reason, including foreign ownership in excess of permitted levels, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct certain operations within our Americas region operations. Therefore, our organizational documents provide for the automatic reduction of voting rights of shares of our outstanding voting capital stock owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens, to the extent necessary to comply with these requirements. As of March 31, 2021 (Successor), we believe that non-U.S. citizens owned less than 25% of our outstanding common stock. Although there is limited trading our common stock, our foreign ownership may nevertheless fluctuate on each trading day, which may result in the reduction of voting rights of shares held by non-U.S. citizens in excess of the 25% threshold pursuant to our organizational documents.
We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), which generally prohibits us and our intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or receiving preferential treatment.
We are subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws and regulations that prohibit dealings with sanctioned countries and certain other third parties.
We are subject to the ITAR that controls the export and import of defense-related articles, services and technical data. ITAR dictates that information and material pertaining to defense and military related technologies may only be shared with U.S. persons or organizations unless authorization from the U.S. State Department is received or a special exemption is used. We are also subject to the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) that control the export of commercial and “dual use” goods. Persons or organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction may incur heavy fines if they violate ITAR or the EAR.
Brazil
In Brazil, an operator must be licensed by the National Agency for Civil Aviation. Recent changes in Brazilian law eliminated the requirement that an operator be “controlled” by nationals of Brazil. Accordingly, we acquired the interests of our former partner and now own 100% of our operating entity in Brazil, Bristow Brazil (formerly Aeróleo). Any change in the licensing requirements could affect the licenses of Bristow Brazil. Our ability to conduct our helicopter operating business in Brazil is dependent on our ability to maintain Bristow Brazil’s licenses and AOC. 
Nigeria
We are subject to state and local laws and regulations governing our services. Our operations in Nigeria are also subject to the Nigerian Content Development Act, which requires that oil and gas contracts be awarded to a company that is seen or perceived to have more “local content” than a “Foreign” competitor. Additionally, the Nigerian Content Development Act allows the monitoring board to penalize companies that do not meet these local content requirements up to 5% of the value of the contract.
Other
We are subject to state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, significant state regulations for our emergency response services. In addition, our operations in other markets are subject to local governmental regulations that may limit foreign ownership of aviation companies. Because of these local regulations, we conduct some of our operations through entities in which citizens of such countries own a majority interest and we hold a noncontrolling interest, or under contracts which provide that we operate assets for the local companies and conduct their flight operations. Changes in local laws, regulations or administrative requirements or their interpretation may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or on our ability to continue operations in these areas.
Environmental
Our business is subject to international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health, including laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters. If we fail to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, administrative, civil and criminal penalties may be imposed, and we may become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders. We may also be subject to civil claims arising out of a pollution event. These laws and regulations may expose us to strict, joint and several liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our own acts even though these actions were in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at the time they were performed. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
These laws include the federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which imposes restrictions on the discharge of pollutants to the navigable waters of the U.S. In addition, because our operations generate and, in some cases, involve the transportation of hazardous wastes, we are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which regulates the use, generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of certain hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and certain comparable state laws, strict, joint and several liability can be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owner and operator of a contaminated site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances, even from inactive operations or closed facilities that have been released into the environment. In addition, neighboring landowners or other third parties may file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response cost. We own, lease, or operate properties and facilities that, in some cases, have been used for industrial activities for many years. Hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment, storage and disposal or release of such substances was not under our control. These properties and the substances and wastes disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
In addition, our customers in the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry are affected by environmental laws and regulations that may restrict their activities and may result in reduced demand for our services.
We believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with all environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect that we will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future that are material to our financial position or operations to comply with environmental laws and regulations; however, because such laws and regulations are frequently changing and may impose stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations.
We manage exposure to losses from the above-described laws and regulations through our efforts to use only well-maintained, well-managed and well-equipped facilities and equipment and our development of safety and environmental programs, including our insurance program. We believe these efforts will be able to accommodate all reasonably foreseeable environmental regulatory changes. There can be no assurance, however, that any future laws, regulations or requirements, or that any discharge or emission of pollutants by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or our results of operations.
Safety, Industry Hazards and Insurance
The safety of our passengers and the maintenance of a safe working environment for our employees is our number one core value and highest operational priority. We have a strong safety culture committed to zero accidents and zero harm to people. Itis owned by each employee and led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for setting the tone at the top. This culture is exemplified by our status as a founding member of HeliOffshore.
Our safety, legal, and compliance departments oversee our adherence with government regulations, customer safety requirements and safety standards within our organization, the standardization of our base operating procedures and the proper training of our employees. A key to maintaining our strong safety record is having highly qualified, experienced, and well-trained employees. We conduct extensive training and develop, implement, monitor, and continuously improve our safety management system to proactively manage risk and support the physical safety and mental wellness of our employees. 
Aviation services are potentially hazardous and may result in incidents or accidents. Challenges to safe operations include unanticipated adverse weather conditions, fires, human factors, and mechanical failures that may result in death or injury to personnel, damage to equipment, and other environmental or property damage.
We have implemented supporting safety programs that include, among many other features, (i) transition and recurrent training using full-motion flight simulators and other flight training devices, (ii) a FAA approved flight data monitoring program (“FDM”) and (iii) health and usage monitoring systems (“HUMS”), which automatically monitor and report on vibrations and other anomalies on key components of certain helicopters in our fleet.
