 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
 CEL-SCI is focused on finding the best way to activate the immune system to fight cancer and infectious diseases. Its lead investigational therapy Multikine® (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection) is currently in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial involving head and neck cancer, for which CEL-SCI has received Orphan Drug Status from the U.S. FDA. If the primary endpoint of this global study is achieved, the results will be used to support applications to regulatory agencies around the world for worldwide commercial marketing approvals as a first line cancer therapy.
  
 CEL-SCI’s immune therapy, Multikine, is being used in a different way than immune therapy is usually used. It is given before any other therapy has been administered because that is when the immune system is thought to be strongest. It is also administered locally to treat tumors or infections. For example, in the Phase 3 clinical trial, Multikine is given locally at the site of the tumor as a first line treatment before surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. The goal is to help the intact immune system kill the micro metastases that usually cause recurrence of the cancer. In short, CEL-SCI believes that local administration and administration before weakening of the immune system by chemotherapy and radiation will result in higher efficacy with less or no toxicity.
  
 CEL-SCI is also investigating a different peptide-based immunotherapy (LEAPS-H1N1-DC) as a possible treatment for H1N1 hospitalized patients and as a vaccine (CEL-2000 and CEL-4000) for Rheumatoid Arthritis (currently in preclinical testing) using its LEAPS technology platform. CEL-SCI was recently awarded a Phase 2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant in the amount of $1.5 million from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This grant will provide funding to allow CEL-SCI to advance its first LEAPS product candidate, CEL-4000, towards an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, by funding GMP manufacturing, IND enabling studies, and additional mechanism of action studies.
  
 CEL-SCI was formed as a Colorado corporation in 1983. CEL-SCI’s principal office is located at 8229 Boone Boulevard, Suite 802, Vienna, VA 22182. CEL-SCI’s telephone number is 703-506-9460 and its website is www.cel-sci.com. CEL-SCI does not incorporate the information on its website into this report, and you should not consider it part of this report.
  
 CEL-SCI makes its electronic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports available on its website free of charge as soon as practicable after they are filed or furnished to the SEC.

  CEL-SCI’S PRODUCTS
  
 CEL-SCI is dedicated to research and development directed at improving the treatment of cancer and other diseases by using the immune system, the body’s natural defense system. CEL-SCI is currently focused on the development of the following product candidates and technologies:
  
  1) 
 Multikine, an investigational immunotherapy under development for the potential treatment of certain head and neck cancers;


  2) 
 L.E.A.P.S. (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System) technology, or LEAPS, with two investigational therapies, LEAPS-H1N1-DC, a product candidate under development for the potential treatment of pandemic influenza in hospitalized patients, and CEL-2000 and CEL-4000, vaccine product candidates under development for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.


  MULTIKINE
  
 CEL-SCI’s lead investigational therapy, Multikine, is currently being developed as a potential therapeutic agent directed at using the immune system to produce an anti-tumor immune response. Data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials suggest that Multikine may help the immune system “see” the tumor and then attack it, enabling the body’s own anti-tumor immune response to fight the tumor. Multikine is the trademark that CEL-SCI has registered for this investigational therapy, and this proprietary name is subject to review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in connection with CEL-SCI’s future anticipated regulatory submission for approval. Multikine has not been licensed or approved for sale, barter or exchange by the FDA or any other regulatory agency, such as the European Medicine Agency, or EMA. Neither has its safety or efficacy been established for any use.
  
 Multikine is an immunotherapy product candidate comprised of a patented defined mixture of 14 human natural cytokines and is manufactured in a proprietary manner in CEL-SCI’s manufacturing facility. CEL-SCI spent over 10 years and more than $80 million developing and validating the manufacturing process for Multikine. The pro-inflammatory cytokine mixture includes interleukins, interferons, chemokines and colony-stimulating factors, which contain elements of the body’s natural mix of defenses against cancer.
  
 Multikine is designed to be used in a different way than immune therapy is generally being used. Generally immunotherapy is given to patients who have already failed other treatments of such as surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy and most of the time it is administered systemically.  Multikine on the other hand is administered locally to treat tumors and their microenvironment before any other therapy has been administered because it is believed that this is the time when the immune system is thought to be most amenable to activation against the tumor.  For example, in the Phase 3 clinical trial, Multikine is injected locally at the site of the tumor and near the adjacent draining lymph nodes as a first line of treatment before surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy because that is when the immune system is thought to be strongest. The goal is to help the intact immune system recognize and kill the tumor micro metastases that usually cause recurrence of the cancer. In short, CEL-SCI believes that the local administration and administration of Multikine and its administration before weakening of the immune system by chemotherapy and radiation will result in better anti-tumor response than if Multikine were administered as a second- or later-line therapy. In clinical studies of Multikine, administration of the investigational therapy to head and neck cancer patients has demonstrated the potential for lesser or no appreciable toxicity.

 The first indication CEL-SCI is pursuing for its investigational drug product candidate Multikine is an indication for the neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN (hereafter also referred to as advanced primary head and neck cancer).
  
 SCCHN is a type of head and neck cancer, and CEL-SCI believes that, in the aggregate, there is a large, unmet medical need among head and neck cancer patients. CEL-SCI believes the last FDA approval of a therapy indicated for the treatment of advanced primary head and neck cancer was over 50 years ago. In the aggregate, head and neck cancer represents about 6% of the world’s cancer cases, with approximately over 650,000 patients diagnosed worldwide each year, and nearly 60,000 patients diagnosed annually in the United States. Multikine investigational immunotherapy was granted Orphan Drug designation for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with SCCHN by the FDA in the United States.
  
 This trial is currently primarily under the management of two clinical research organizations, or CROs: ICON Inc., or ICON, and Ergomed Clinical Research Limited, or Ergomed.
  
 The Phase 3 study was designed with the objective that, if the study endpoint, which is an improvement in overall survival of the subjects treated with the Multikine treatment regimen plus the current standard of care (SOC) as compared to subjects treated with the current SOC only, is satisfied, the study results are expected to be used to support applications that CEL-SCI plans to submit to regulatory agencies in order to seek commercial marketing approvals for Multikine in major markets around the world. This assessment can only be made when a certain number of deaths have occurred in these two main comparator groups of the study.
  
 The primary endpoint for the protocol for this Phase 3 head and neck cancer study required that a 10% increase in overall survival be obtained in the Multikine group which also is administered CIZ (CIZ = low dose (non-chemotherapeutic) of cyclophosphamide, indomethacin and Zinc-multivitamins) all of which are thought to enhance Multikine activity), plus Standard of Care (Surgery + Radiotherapy or Chemoradiotherapy) arm of the study over the Control comparator (Standard of Care alone) arm. As the study was designed, the final determination of whether this endpoint had been successfully reached could only be determined when 298 events (deaths) had occurred in the combined comparator arms of the study.

 Nine hundred twenty-eight (928) newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients have been enrolled in this Phase 3 cancer study and all the patients who have completed treatment continue to be followed for protocol-specific outcomes in accordance with the Study Protocol. The last patient was enrolled in the study in September 2016. Approximately 135 patients were enrolled in the study from 2011 to 2013, about 195 were enrolled in 2014, about 340 in 2015, and about 260 in 2016. The study protocol assumed an overall survival rate of about 55% at 3 years for the SOC treatment group alone. At this point in the study the 928 patients enrolled in the study are being followed-up as required by the study protocol.
  
 Since CEL-SCI launched its Phase 3 clinical trial for Multikine, CEL-SCI has incurred expenses of approximately $45.9 million as of September 30, 2017 on direct costs for the Phase 3 clinical trial. CEL-SCI estimates it will incur additional expenses of approximately $13.0 million for the remainder of the Phase 3 clinical trial. It should be noted that this estimate is based only on the information currently available in CEL-SCI’s contracts with the Clinical Research Organizations responsible for managing the Phase 3 clinical trial and does not include other related costs, e.g., the manufacturing of the drug. This number may be affected by the rate of death accumulation in the study, foreign currency exchange rates, and many other factors, some of which cannot be foreseen today. It is therefore possible that the cost of the Phase 3 clinical trial will be higher than currently estimated.
  
 Throughout the course of the Phase 3 study, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, has met periodically to review safety data from the Phase 3 study, and the IDMC is expected to continue doing so throughout the remainder of the Phase 3 study. At various points in the study at which the IDMC has completed review of the safety data and has issued recommendations, it has recommended that the Phase 3 study may continue. However, on one occasion, in the spring of 2014, the IDMC made a recommendation that the study be closed. This recommendation by the IDMC was reversed following review of additional information submitted by CEL-SCI, and the IDMC recommended that the study continue. In the spring of 2016, with close to 800 patients enrolled, the IDMC made a recommendation that enrollment in the Phase 3 study should stop, but that patients already enrolled in the study should continue treatment and follow-up. CEL-SCI responded to this letter and indicated it would address the remaining three requests, generally relating to study design considerations that were not part of the IDMC recommendation in follow-up correspondence. Subsequent to this correspondence, CEL-SCI submitted a complete response to the IDMC addressing all of their requests, as well as providing to them a copy of the suggested protocol amendment which was sent to the FDA for review and comment, as was requested by the IDMC. The IDMC did not provide any additional response following the additional submission to them.
  
 On September 26, 2016, CEL-SCI received notice from the FDA that the Phase 3 clinical trial in advanced primary head and neck cancer has been placed on partial clinical hold. In August 2017, FDA removed the clinical hold on the Phase 3 study and informed CEL-SCI that all clinical trial activities under this Investigational New Drug application (IND) may resume.
  
 In September 2016, the last patient was accrued to the study. A total of 928 randomized patients were enrolled in the study as of that date. In December 2016, and again in February 2017 the IDMC reviewed the data from the Study, but offered no recommendation as they awaited the outcome of discussions with the FDA regarding the clinical hold, which was subsequently removed by the FDA on August 10, 2017.

 On December 7, 2017 CEL-SCI announced that the IDMC had completed its most recent review of the Phase 3 study data. The data from all 928 enrolled patients were provided to the IDMC by the clinical research organization (CRO) responsible for data management of this Phase 3 study. The IDMC made the following observation and recommendation, a) the IDMC saw no evidence of any significant safety questions and b) the IDMC recommends continuing the study.
  
 On December 11, 2017 CEL-SCI announced that the Phase 3 clinical study is fully enrolled and will not need to enroll more patients.
  
 Ultimately, the decision as to whether CEL-SCI’s drug product candidate is safe and effective can only be made by FDA and/or by other regulatory authorities based upon an assessment of all of the data from an entire drug development program submitted as part of an application for marketing approval. As detailed elsewhere in this report the current Phase 3 clinical study for CEL-SCI’s investigational drug may or may not be able to be used as the pivotal study supporting a marketing application in the United States, and, if not, at least one entirely new Phase 3 pivotal study would need to be conducted to support a marketing application in the United States.
  
  Follow-Up Analysis of Overall Survival in Phase 2 Patients
  
 Prior to starting the Phase 3 study, CEL-SCI had tested Multikine in over 200 patients. The following is a summary of results from CEL-SCI’s last Phase 2 study conducted with Multikine. This study employed the same treatment protocol as is being followed in CEL-SCI’s Phase 3 study:
  
   ●
 Reported potential for improved survival: In a follow-up analysis of the Phase 2 clinical study population, which used the same dosage and treatment regimen as is being used in the Phase 3 study, head and neck cancer patients with locally advanced primary disease who received the investigational therapy Multikine as first-line investigational therapy, followed by surgery and radiotherapy, were reported by the clinical investigators to have had a 63.2% overall survival, or OS, rate at a median of 3.33 years from surgery. This percentage of OS was arrived at as follows: of the 21 subjects enrolled in the Phase 2 study, the consent for the survival follow-up portion of the study was received from 19 subjects. OS was calculated using the entire treatment population that consented to the follow-up portion of the study (19 subjects), including two subjects who, as later determined by three pathologists blinded to the study, did not have oral squamous cell carcinoma, or OSCC. These two subjects were thus not evaluable per the protocol and were not included in the pathology portion of the study for purposes of calculating complete response rate, as described below, but were included in the OS calculation. The overall survival rate of subjects receiving the investigational therapy in this study was compared to the overall survival rate that was calculated based upon a review of 55 clinical trials conducted in the same cancer population (with a total of 7,294 patients studied), and reported in the peer reviewed scientific literature between 1987 and 2007. Review of this literature showed an approximate survival rate of 47.5% at 3.5 years from treatment. Therefore, the results of CEL-SCI's final Phase 2 study were considered to be potentially favorable in terms of overall survival, recognizing the limitations of this early-phase study. It should be noted that an earlier investigational therapy Multikine study appears to lend support to the overall survival findings described above - Feinmesser et al Arch Otolaryngol. Surg. 2003. However, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data about the potential efficacy or safety profile of this investigational therapy. Moreover, further research is required, and these results must be confirmed in the Phase 3 clinical trial of this investigational therapy that is currently in progress. Subject to completion of that Phase 3 clinical trial and the FDA’s review and acceptance of CEL-SCI's entire data set on this investigational therapy, CEL-SCI believes that these early-stage clinical trial results indicate the potential for the Multikine product candidate to become a treatment for advanced primary head and neck cancer, if approved.

   ●
 Reported average of 50% reduction in tumor cells in Phase 2 trials (based on 19 patients evaluable by pathology, having OSCC): The clinical investigators who administered the three week Multikine treatment regimen used in the Phase 2 study reported that, as was determined in a controlled pathology study, Multikine administration appeared to have caused, on average, the disappearance of about half of the cancer cells present at surgery (as determined by histopathology assessing the area of Stroma/Tumor (Mean+/- Standard Error of the Mean of the number of cells counted per filed)) even before the start of standard therapy, which normally includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy (Timar et al JCO 2005).


   ●
 Reported 10.5% complete response in the final Phase 2 trial (based on 19 patients evaluable by pathology, having OSCC): The clinical investigators who administered the three-week Multikine investigational treatment regimen used in the Phase 2 study reported that, as was determined in a controlled pathology study, the tumor apparently was no longer present (as determined by histopathology) in approximately 10.5% of evaluable patients with OSCC (Timar et al JCO 2005). In the original study, 21 subjects received Multikine, two of which were later excluded, as subsequent analysis by three pathologists blinded to the study revealed that these two patients did not have OSCC. Two subjects in this study had a complete response, leaving a reported complete response rate of two out of 19 assessable subjects with OSCC (or 10.5%) (Timar et al JCO 2005).


   ●
 Adverse events reported in clinical trials: In clinical trials conducted to date with the Multikine investigational therapy, adverse events which have been reported by the clinical investigators as possibly or probably related to Multikine administration included pain at the injection site, local minor bleeding and edema at the injection site, diarrhea, headache, nausea, and constipation.

 
 Subsequently, an analysis on the 21 subjects originally treated with Multikine in the study to evaluate overall survival was conducted, as described above. In connection with the follow-up portion of the study for overall survival, CEL-SCI also conducted an unreported post-hoc analysis of complete response rate in the study population, which included subjects who provided consent for the follow-up and who also had OSCC. Two of the 21 subjects did not re-consent for follow-up, and two of the remaining 19 subjects were excluded from the post-hoc complete response rate analysis as they had previously been determined by pathology analysis to not have OSCC. The two complete responders with OSCC both consented to the follow-up study. Therefore, the post-hoc analysis of complete response was based on a calculation of the two complete responders out of 17 evaluable subjects who consented to the follow-up analysis and who also had OSCC (or 11.8%).
  
 Furthermore, CEL-SCI reported an overall response rate of 42.1% based on the number of evaluable patients who experienced a favorable response to the treatment, including those who experienced minor, major and complete responses. Out of the 19 evaluable patients, two experienced a complete response, two experienced a major response, and four experienced a minor response to treatment. Thus, CEL-SCI calculated the number of patients experiencing a favorable response as eight patients out of 19 (or 42.1%) (Timar et al, JCO 2005).
  
 The clinical significance of these and other data, to date, from the multiple Multikine clinical trials, is not yet known. These preliminary clinical data do suggest the potential to demonstrate a possible improvement in the clinical outcome for patients treated with Multikine.

  Peri-Anal Warts and Cervical Dysplasia in HIV/HPV Co-Infected Patients
  
 HPV is a very common sexually transmitted disease in the United States and other parts of the world. It can lead to cancer of the cervix, penis, anus, esophagus and head and neck. CEL-SCI’s focus in HPV, however, is not on developing an antiviral for the potential treatment or prevention of HPV in the general population. Instead, the focus is on developing an immunotherapy product candidate designed to be administered to patients who are immune-suppressed by other diseases, such as HIV, and who are therefore less able or unable to control HPV and its resultant or co-morbid diseases. Such patients have limited treatment options available to them.
  
 One condition that is commonly associated with both HIV and HPV is the occurrence of anal intraepithelial dysplasia, or AIN, and anal and genital warts. The incidence of AIN in HIV-infected people is estimated to be about 25%. The incidence of anal HPV infection in HIV-infected men who have sex with men, or MSM, is estimated to be as high as 95%. In the aggregate, the United States and Europe have about 875,000 HIV-infected patients with AIN (assuming AIN prevalence of approximately 25% of the aggregate HIV-infected population). Persistent HPV infection in the anal region is thought to be responsible for up to 80% of anal cancers, and men and women who are HIV positive have a 30-fold increase in their risk of anal cancer. Persistent HPV infection can also be a precursor to cervical cancer, as well as certain head and neck cancers.
  
 In October 2013, CEL-SCI signed a cooperative research and development agreement, or CRADA, with the U.S. Naval Medical Center, San Diego, or the USNMC. Pursuant to this agreement, the USNMC was to conduct a Phase 1 study, approved by the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board, of CEL-SCI’s investigational immunotherapy, Multikine, in HIV/HPV co-infected men and women with peri-anal warts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and clinical impact of Multikine as a potential treatment of peri-anal warts and assess its effect on AIN in HIV/HPV co-infected men and women.
  
 In July 2015, CEL-SCI added a clinical site at the University of California, San Francisco, or UCSF, and Key Opinion Leader, or KOL, to the ongoing Phase 1 study. In August 2016, the U.S. Navy discontinued this Phase 1 study because of difficulties in enrolling patients. UCSF is continuing with the study. The Company will not continue with this indication because 1) the patient enrollment is extremely slow and 2) it needs to focus its resources on the Phase 3 study.
  
 In October 2013, CEL-SCI entered into a co-development and profit sharing agreement with Ergomed for development of Multikine as a potential treatment of HIV/HPV co-infected men and women with peri-anal warts. This agreement is supporting the development of Multikine with UCSF.
  
 The treatment regimen for this Phase 1 study of up to 15 HIV/HPV co-infected patient volunteers with peri-anal warts is identical to the regimen that was used in an earlier Institutional Review Board-approved Multikine Phase 1 study in HIV/HPV co-infected patients, which was conducted at the University of Maryland. In that study, the Multikine investigational therapy was administered to HIV/HPV co-infected women with cervical dysplasia, resulting in visual and histological evidence of clearance of lesions in three out of the eight subjects.
  
   
8


  
 
 Furthermore, in this cervical dysplasia Phase 1 study, the number of HPV viral sub-types in three volunteer subjects tested were reduced post-treatment with Multikine, as opposed to pre-treatment, as determined by in situ polymerase chain reaction performed on tissue biopsy collected before and after Multikine treatment. As reported by the investigators in the earlier study, the study volunteers, except one subject volunteer, all appeared to tolerate the treatment with no reported serious adverse events.
  
  Development Agreements for Multikine
  
 In August 2008, CEL-SCI signed an agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva, that gives Teva the exclusive right and license to market, distribute and sell Multikine in Israel and Turkey for treatment of head and neck cancer, if approved. The agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis 10 years after the product launch in each country or upon a material breach or upon bankruptcy of either party. The agreement will automatically extend for additional two year terms unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend the agreement. If CEL-SCI develops Multikine for other oncology indications and Teva indicates a desire to participate, the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith with respect to Teva’s participation and contribution in future clinical trials.
  
 Teva has agreed to use all reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell Multikine in its territory at its own cost and expense. Pursuant to the agreement, it is CEL-SCI’s responsibility to supply Multikine and Teva’s responsibility to sell Multikine, if approved. Net sales will be divided 50/50 between the two parties. Teva also initially agreed to fund certain activities relating to the conduct of a clinical trial in Israel as part of the global Phase 3 trial for Multikine. In January 2012, pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement between CEL-SCI, Teva and GCP Clinical Studies Ltd., or GCP, Teva transferred all of its rights and obligations concerning the Phase III trial in Israel to GCP. GCP is now operating the Phase 3 trial in Israel pursuant to a service agreement with CEL-SCI.
  
 In July 2011, Serbia and Croatia were added to Teva’s territory, pursuant to a joinder agreement between CEL-SCI and PLIVA Hrvatska d.o.o., or PLIVA, an affiliate of Teva’s, subject to similar terms as described above.
  
 In consideration for the rights granted by CEL-SCI to PLIVA under the joinder agreement, CEL-SCI will be paid by PLIVA (in U.S. dollars):
  
   ● 
 $100,000 upon EMA grant of Marketing Authorization for Multikine;


   ● 
 $50,000 upon Croatia’s grant of reimbursement status for Multikine in Croatia; and


   ● 
 $50,000 upon Serbia’s grant of reimbursement status for Multikine in Serbia.

 
 In November 2000, CEL-SCI signed an agreement with Orient Europharma Co., Ltd., or Orient Europharma, of Taiwan, which agreement was amended in October 2008 and again in June 2010. Pursuant to this agreement, as amended, Orient Europharma has the exclusive marketing and distribution rights to Multikine, if approved, for head and neck cancer, naso-pharyngeal cancer and potentially cervical cancer indications in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. CEL-SCI has granted Orient Europharma the first right of negotiation with respect to Thailand and China.
  
   
9


  
 
 The agreement requires Orient Europharma to fund 10% of the cost of the clinical trials needed to obtain marketing approvals in these countries for head and neck cancer, naso-pharyngeal cancer and potentially cervical cancer. Orient Europharma has signed ten centers in Taiwan, four centers in Malaysia, three centers in Philippines and one center in Thailand to enroll patients as part of the Phase 3 Multikine clinical trial and has made further financial contributions towards the cost of the Phase 3 clinical trial.
  
If Multikine is approved for sale, Orient Europharma will purchase Multikine from CEL-SCI for 35% of the gross selling price in each country. Orient Europharma is obligated to use the same diligent efforts to develop, register, market, sell and distribute Multikine in the territory as with its own products or other licensed products.
  
 The agreement will terminate on a country-by-country basis 15 years after the product approval for Multikine in each country, at which point the agreement will be automatically extended for successive two year periods, unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend the agreement. The agreement may also be terminated upon bankruptcy of either party or material misrepresentations that are not cured within 60 days. If the agreement ends before the 15 year term through no fault of either party, CEL-SCI will reimburse Orient Europharma for a prorated part of Orient Europhorma’s costs towards the clinical trials of Multikine. If Orient Europharma fails to make certain minimum purchases of Multikine during the term of the agreement, Orient Europhorma’s rights to the territory will become non-exclusive.
  
 CEL-SCI has a licensing agreement with Byron Biopharma LLC, or Byron, under which CEL-SCI granted Byron an exclusive license to market and distribute Multikine in the Republic of South Africa, if approved. This license will terminate 20 years after marketing approval in South Africa or after bankruptcy or uncured material breach. After the 20-year period has expired, the agreement will be automatically extended for successive two year periods, unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend the agreement.
  
 Pursuant to the agreement, Byron will be responsible for registering Multikine in South Africa. If Multikine is approved for sale in South Africa, CEL-SCI will be responsible for manufacturing the product, while Byron will be responsible for sales in South Africa. Sales revenues will be divided between CEL-SCI and Byron. CEL-SCI will be paid fifty (50%) percent of the net sales of Multikine.
  
  MANUFACTURING FACILITY
  
 Before starting the Phase 3 clinical trial, for reasons related to regulatory considerations, CEL-SCI needed to build a dedicated manufacturing facility to produce Multikine. This facility has been completed and validated, and has produced multiple clinical lots for the Phase 3 clinical trial. The facility has also passed review by a European Union Qualified Person on several occasions.
  
   
10


  
 
 CEL-SCI’s lease on the manufacturing facility expires on October 31, 2028. CEL-SCI completed validation of its new manufacturing facility in January 2010. The state-of-the-art facility is being used to manufacture Multikine for CEL-SCI’s Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition to using this facility to manufacture Multikine, CEL-SCI, only if the facility is not being used for Multikine, may offer the use of the facility as a service to pharmaceutical companies and others, particularly those that need to “fill and finish” their drugs in a cold environment (4 degrees Celsius, or approximately 39 degrees Fahrenheit). Fill and finish is the process of filling injectable drugs in a sterile manner and is a key part of the manufacturing process for many medicines. However, priority will always be given to Multikine as management considers the Multikine supply to the clinical studies and preparation for a final marketing approval to be more important than offering fill and finish services. See Item 2 of this report for more information concerning the terms of this lease.
  
  LEAPS
  
 CEL-SCI’s patented T-cell Modulation Process, referred to as LEAPS (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System), uses “heteroconjugates” to direct the body to choose a specific immune response. LEAPS is designed to stimulate the human immune system to more effectively fight bacterial, viral and parasitic infections as well as autoimmune, allergies, transplantation rejection and cancer, when it cannot do so on its own. Administered like a vaccine, LEAPS combines T-cell binding ligands with small, disease associated, peptide antigens and may provide a new method to treat and prevent certain diseases.
  
 The ability to generate a specific immune response is important because many diseases are often not combated effectively due to the body’s selection of the “inappropriate” immune response. The capability to specifically reprogram an immune response may offer a more effective approach than existing vaccines and drugs in attacking an underlying disease.
  
 On September 19, 2017, CEL-SCI announced that it has been awarded a Phase 2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant in the amount of $1.5 million from the National Institute of Arthritis Muscoskeletal and Skin Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This grant will provide funding to allow CEL-SCI to advance its first LEAPS product candidate, CEL-4000, towards an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, by funding GMP manufacturing, IND enabling studies, and additional mechanism of action studies. The work is being conducted at CEL-SCI’s research laboratory and Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois in the laboratories of Tibor Glant, MD, Ph.D., The Jorge O. Galante Professor of Orthopedic Surgery and Katalin Mikecz, MD, Ph.D. Professor of Orthopedic Surgery & Biochemistry. The grant was awarded based on published data described below by Dr. Glant's team in collaboration with CEL-SCI showing that the administration of a proprietary peptide using CEL-SCI's LEAPS technology prevented the development, and lessened the severity, including inflammation, of experimental proteoglycan induced arthritis (PGIA or GIA) when it was administered after the disease was induced in the animals.

 In July 2014, CEL-SCI announced that it has been awarded a Phase 1 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant in the amount of $225,000 from the National Institute of Arthritis Muscoskeletal and Skin Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. The grant funded the development of CEL-SCI’s LEAPS technology as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease of the joints. The work was conducted at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois in the laboratories of Tibor Glant, MD, Ph.D., The Jorge O.

 With the support of the SBIR grant, CEL-SCI is developing two new drug candidates, CEL-2000 and CEL-4000, as potential rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic vaccines. The data from animal studies using the CEL-2000 treatment vaccine demonstrated that it could be used as an effective treatment against rheumatoid arthritis with fewer administrations than those required by other anti-rheumatoid arthritis treatments currently on the market for arthritic conditions associated with the Th17 signature cytokine TNF-  . The data for CEL-4000 indicates it could be effective against rheumatoid arthritis cases where a Th1 signature cytokine (IFN-c) is dominant. CEL-2000 and CEL-4000 have the potential to be a more disease-specific therapy, significantly less expensive, act at an earlier step in the disease process than current therapies and may be useful in patients not responding to existing rheumatoid arthritis therapies. CEL-SCI believes this represents a large unmet medical need in the rheumatoid arthritis market.
  
 In February 2017 and November 2016, CEL-SCI announced new preclinical data that demonstrate its investigational new drug candidate CEL-4000 has the potential for use as a therapeutic vaccine to treat rheumatoid arthritis. This efficacy study was supported in part by the SBIR Phase I Grant and was conducted in collaboration with Drs. Katalin Mikecz and Tibor Glant, and their research team at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, IL.
  
 In March 2015, CEL-SCI and its collaborators published a review article on vaccine therapies for rheumatoid arthritis based in part on work supported by the SBIR grant. The article is entitled “Rheumatoid arthritis vaccine therapies: perspectives and lessons from therapeutic Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System vaccines for models of rheumatoid arthritis” and was published in Expert Rev. Vaccines 1 - 18 and can be found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pubmed/25787143.
  
 In August 2012, Dr. Zimmerman, CEL-SCI’s Senior Vice President of Research, Cellular Immunology, gave a Keynote presentation at the OMICS 2nd International Conference on Vaccines and Vaccinations in Chicago. This presentation showed how the LEAPS peptides administered altered only select cytokines specific for each disease model, thereby improving the status of the test animals and even preventing death and morbidity. These results support the growing body of evidence that provides for its mode of action by a common format in these unrelated conditions by regulation of Th1 (e.g., IL12 and IFN-c) and their action on reducing TNF-  and other inflammatory cytokines as well as regulation of antibodies to these disease associated antigens. This was also illustrated by a schematic model showing how these pathways interact and result in the overall effect of protection and regulation of cytokines in a beneficial manner.

 In February 2010, CEL-SCI announced that its CEL-2000 vaccine demonstrated that it was able to block the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in a mouse model, where a Th17 signature cytokine (TNF-  ) is dominant. The results were published in the scientific peer-reviewed Journal of International Immunopharmacology (online edition) in an article titled “CEL-2000: A Therapeutic Vaccine for Rheumatoid Arthritis Arrests Disease Development and Alters Serum Cytokine / Chemokine Patterns in the Bovine Collagen Type II Induced Arthritis in the DBA Mouse Model” Int Immunopharmacol. 2010 Apr; 10(4):412-21 http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20074669.
  
 Using the LEAPS technology, CEL-SCI has created a potential peptide treatment for H1N1 (swine flu) hospitalized patients.  This LEAPS flu treatment is designed to focus on the conserved, non-changing epitopes of the different strains of Type A Influenza viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H3N1, etc.), including “swine”, “avian or bird”, and “Spanish Influenza”, in order to minimize the chance of viral “escape by mutations” from immune recognition. Therefore one should think of this treatment not really as an H1N1 treatment, but as a potential pandemic flu treatment. CEL-SCI’s LEAPS flu treatment contains epitopes known to be associated with immune protection against influenza in animal models. 
  
 In September 2009, the U.S. FDA advised CEL-SCI that it could proceed with its first clinical trial to evaluate the effect of LEAPS-H1N1 treatment on the white blood cells of hospitalized H1N1 patients. This followed an expedited initial review of CEL-SCI's regulatory submission for this study proposal.
  
 In November 2009, CEL-SCI announced that The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine had given clearance for CEL-SCI’s first clinical study to proceed using LEAPS-H1N1.   Soon after the start of the study, the number of hospitalized H1N1 patients dramatically declined and the study was unable to complete the enrollment of patients.
  
 Additional work on this treatment for the pandemic flu is being pursued in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, USA. In May 2011 NIAID scientists presented data at the Keystone Conference on “Pathogenesis of Influenza: Virus-Host Interactions” in Hong Kong, China, showing the positive results of efficacy studies in mice of LEAPS H1N1 activated dendritic cells (DCs) to treat the H1N1 virus. Scientists at the NIAID found that H1N1-infected mice treated with LEAPS-H1N1 DCs showed a survival advantage over mice treated with control DCs. The work was performed in collaboration with scientists led by Kanta Subbarao, M.D., Chief of the Emerging Respiratory Diseases Section in NIAID’s Division of Intramural Research, part of the National Institutes of Health, USA.
  
 In July 2013, CEL-SCI announced the publication of the results of influenza studies by researchers from the NIAID in the Journal of Clinical Investigation (www.jci.org/articles/view/67550). The studies described in the publication show that when CEL-SCI’s investigational J-LEAPS Influenza Virus treatments were used “in vitro” to activate DCs, these activated DCs, when injected into influenza infected mice, arrested the progression of lethal influenza virus infection in these mice. The work was performed in the laboratory of Dr. Subbarao.

 Even though the various LEAPS drug candidates have not yet been given to humans, they have been tested in vitro with human cells. They have induced similar cytokine responses that were seen in these animal models, which may indicate that the LEAPS technology might translate to humans. The LEAPS candidates have demonstrated protection against lethal herpes simplex virus (HSV1) and H1N1 influenza infection, as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent in animals. They have also shown some level of efficacy in animals in two autoimmune conditions, curtailing and sometimes preventing disease progression in arthritis and myocarditis animal models. CEL-SCI’s belief is that the LEAPS technology may be a significant alternative to the vaccines currently available on the market for these diseases.
  
 None of the LEAPS investigational products have been approved for sale, barter or exchange by the FDA or any other regulatory agency for any use to treat disease in animals or humans. The safety or efficacy of these products has not been established for any use. Lastly, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from the early-phase, preclinical-trials data involving these investigational products. Before obtaining marketing approval from the FDA in the United States, and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries, these product candidates must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing which is costly and time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays. There can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted.
  
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
  
 Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to CEL-SCI’s business. CEL-SCI files patent applications to protect its technologies, inventions and improvements to its inventions that CEL-SCI considers important to the development of its business. CEL-SCI’S intellectual property portfolio covers its proprietary technologies, including Multikine and LEAPS, by multiple issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key foreign markets.
 
 Multikine is protected by a US patent, which is a composition-of-matter patent issued in May 2005 that, in its current format, expires in 2023. Additional composition-of-matter patents for Multikine have been issued in Germany (issued in June 2011 and currently set to expire in 2025), China (issued in May 2011 and currently set to expire in 2024), Japan (issued in November 2012 and currently set to expire in 2025), and three in Europe (issued in September 2015, May 2016 and October 4, 2017, currently set to expire in 2025 and 2026). In September 2017 CEL-SCI announced that the European Patent Office has issued a new patent to CEL-SCI for Multikine. Patent # EP 1 879 618 B1, titled “A Method for Modulating HLA Class II Tumor Cell Surface Expression With A Cytokine Mixture,” addresses Multikine’s mechanism of action to make tumors more visible to the immune system. This new patent is important because, along with the other Multikine issued patents, it addresses how Multikine enables the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor. One way tumor cells evade the immune system is by expressing human leukocyte antigens (HLA) on the tumor cell surface, thus appearing as ‘self’ to the immune cells and therefore the tumor cells are not attacked. It is important to note that the tumors of the Multikine-treated responders in CEL-SCI’s prior Phase 2 studies had no HLA Class II expressed on the cell surface following Multikine treatment as compared to controls. This points to Multikine’s ability to modulate HLA expression on the tumor cell surface, thereby allowing the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor.

 In addition to the patents that offer certain protections for Multikine, the method of manufacture for Multikine, a complex biological product, is held by CEL-SCI as trade secret.
  
 LEAPS is protected by patents in the United States issued in February 2006, April 2007, and August 2007. The LEAPS patents, which expire in 2021, 2022 and 2021, respectively, include overlapping claims, with composition of both matter (new chemical entity), process and methods-of-use, to maximize and extend the coverage in their current format. In October 2017, a patent was issued in Europe for LEAPS, which expires in 2029. Additional patent applications are pending in the United States and Europe that could offer protection through 2034.
  
 CEL-SCI has six patent applications pending in the United States and one in Europe for LEAPS, which, if issued, would extend protection through 2034, subject to any potential patent term extensions. One pending U.S. application is a joint application with Northeast Ohio Medical University (“Neoucom”). If granted, CEL-SCI will share the ability to use the patent, unless CEL-SCI licenses the rights to the patent application and any ensuing patent from Neoucom.
  
 As of December 21, 2017, there were no contested proceedings and/or third party claims with respect to CEL-SCI’s patents or patent applications.
