Item 1.  Business
 Stepan Company, which was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on February 19, 1959, and its subsidiaries produce specialty and intermediate chemicals, which are sold to other manufacturers and used in a variety of end products.  The Company has three reportable segments: Surfactants, Polymers and Specialty Products.
 Surfactants are chemical agents that affect the interaction between two surfaces; they can provide actions such as detergency (i.e., the ability of water to remove soil from another surface), wetting and foaming, dispersing, emulsification (aiding two dissimilar liquids to mix), demulsification, viscosity modifications and biocidal disinfectants. Surfactants are the basic cleaning agent in detergents for washing clothes, dishes, carpets, fine fabrics, floors and walls.  Surfactants are also used for the same purpose in shampoos, body wash and conditioners, fabric softeners, toothpastes, cosmetics and other personal care products.  Commercial and industrial applications include emulsifiers for agricultural products, emulsion polymers such as floor polishes and latex foams and coatings, wetting and foaming agents for wallboard manufacturing and surfactants for enhanced oil recovery.  In 2016, the Company’s subsidiary in Brazil purchased the commercial business of Tebras Tensoativos do Brazil Ltda. (Tebras) and the sulfonation production facility of PBC Industria Quimica Ltda. (PBC).  The acquisition is expected to expand and diversify the Company’s customer base for sulfonated products in Brazil and to provide an opportunity to sell the Company’s broader surfactants portfolio to over 1,200 new customers who management believes will benefit from the Company’s technical service and formulation support.
 Polymers, which include polyurethane polyols, polyester resins and phthalic anhydride, are used in a variety of applications.  Polyurethane polyols are used in the manufacture of rigid foam for thermal insulation in the construction industry.  They are also a raw material base for coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (CASE) applications.  Polyester resins, which include liquid and powdered products, are used in CASE and polyurethane systems house applications. Phthalic anhydride is used in polyester resins, alkyd resins, and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive, boating, and other consumer products and internally in the Company’s polyols.  
 Specialty Products are chemicals used in food, flavoring, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical applications.  
 MARKETING AND COMPETITION
 Principal customers for surfactants are manufacturers of detergents, shampoos, body wash, fabric softeners, toothpastes and cosmetics.  In addition, surfactants are sold to the producers of agricultural herbicides and insecticides and lubricating products.  Surfactants are also sold into the enhanced oil recovery end markets.  Polymers are used in the construction and appliance industries, as well as in applications for the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries.  Phthalic anhydride, a Polymer product, is also used by automotive, boating and other consumer product companies. Specialty products are used primarily by food, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
 The Company does not sell directly to the retail market, but sells to a wide range of manufacturers in many industries and has many competitors.  The principal methods of competition are product performance, price, technical assistance and adaptability to the specific needs of individual customers.  These factors allow the Company to compete on bases other than price alone, reducing the severity of competition as experienced in the sales of commodity chemicals having identical performance characteristics.  The Company is one of the leading merchant producers of surfactants in the world.  In the case of surfactants, much of the Company’s competition comes from several large global and regional producers and the internal divisions of larger customers.  In the manufacture of polymers, the Company competes with the chemical divisions of several large companies, as well as with other small specialty chemical manufacturers.  In specialty products, the Company competes with several large firms plus numerous small companies.  
 MAJOR CUSTOMER AND BACKLOG
 The Company did not have any one customer whose business represented more than 10 percent of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2016, 2015 or 2014.  The Company has contract arrangements with certain customers, but volumes are generally contingent on purchaser requirements. Much of the Company’s business is essentially on a “spot delivery basis” and does not involve a significant backlog.  
ENERGY SOURCES
 Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing plants operate on electricity and interruptible natural gas.  During peak heating demand periods, gas service to all plants may be temporarily interrupted for varying periods ranging from a few days to several months.  The plants operate on fuel oil during these periods of interruption.  The Company’s operations have not experienced any

plant shutdowns or adverse effects upon its business in recent years that were caused by a lack of available energy sources, other than temporary service interruptions brought on by mechanical failure.  
 RAW MATERIALS
 The principal raw materials used by the Company are petroleum or plant based.  For 2017, the Company has contracts with suppliers that cover the majority of its forecasted requirements for major raw materials and is not substantially dependent upon any one supplier.  
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 The Company maintains an active research and development program to assist in the discovery and commercialization of new knowledge with the intent that such efforts will be useful in developing a new product or in bringing about a significant improvement to an existing product or process.  Total expenses for research and development during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $34.9 million, $30.3 million, and $27.2 million, respectively. The remainder of research, development and technical service expenses reflected in the consolidated statements of income relates to technical services, which include routine product testing, analytical methods development and sales support service.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
 Compliance with applicable country, state and local regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, resulted in capital expenditures by the Company of approximately $1.7 million during 2016.  These expenditures represented approximately 2 percent of the Company’s total 2016 capital expenditures.  Capitalized environmental expenditures are depreciated and charged on a straight-line basis to pretax earnings over their estimated useful lives, which are typically 10 years.  Recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at our manufacturing locations were approximately $25.0 million in 2016.  Compliance with such regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s earnings and competitive position in the foreseeable future.
EMPLOYMENT
 At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company employed 2,145 and 2,073 persons, respectively. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with employees at some of its manufacturing locations. While the Company has experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future, management believes that it will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms. Past work stoppages have not had a significant impact on the Company’s operating results. Overall, the Company believes it has good relationships with its employees.
