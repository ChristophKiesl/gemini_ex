Introduction
Crestwood Equity, a Delaware limited partnership formed in March 2001, is a master limited partnership (MLP) that develops, acquires, owns or controls, and operates primarily fee-based assets and operations within the energy midstream sector. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we provide broad-ranging infrastructure solutions across the value chain to service premier liquids-rich natural gas and crude oil shale plays across the United States. We own and operate a diversified portfolio of NGL, crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering, processing, storage, disposal and transportation assets that connect fundamental energy supply with energy demand across North America. Our primary business objective is to maximize the value of Crestwood Equity for our unitholders. Crestwood Equity’s common units representing limited partner interests are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CEQP” and its preferred units representing limited partner interests are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CEQP-P.”
Crestwood Equity is a holding company. All of our consolidated operating assets are owned by or through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crestwood Midstream, a Delaware limited partnership. In addition, we have equity investments in joint ventures through which we operate certain of their respective assets.
Strategic Transactions
During 2022, we completed a number of strategic transactions that we believe will position the Company to become a stronger, better capitalized company, and we continued to execute on our strategy of maximizing unitholder value through portfolio optimization and the reinvestment of cash flow and divestiture proceeds into the balance sheet, common unit repurchases, common unit and preferred unit distributions, and high returning investment opportunities. These strategic transactions included: (i) the merger with Oasis Midstream Partners LP (Oasis Midstream); (ii) the acquisition of Sendero Midstream Partners; LP (Sendero); (iii) the acquisition of First Reserve Management, L.P.’s (First Reserve) 50% equity interest in Crestwood Permian Basin Holdings LLC (Crestwood Permian); (iv) the divestiture of our Barnett Shale assets; (v) the divestiture of our Marcellus Shale assets; and (vi) the anticipated divestiture of our Tres Palacios Holdings LLC (Tres Holdings) equity investment. 
Oasis Merger 
On February 1, 2022, we acquired Oasis Midstream in an equity and cash transaction valued at approximately $1.8 billion (Oasis Merger). Pursuant to the merger agreement, Oasis Petroleum Inc., now known as Chord Energy Corporation (Chord), received $150 million in cash plus 20.9 million newly issued CEQP common units in exchange for its 33.8 million common units held in Oasis Midstream. In addition, Oasis Midstream’s public unitholders received 12.9 million newly issued CEQP common units in exchange for the 14.8 million Oasis Midstream common units held by them. Additionally, under the merger agreement, Chord received a $10 million cash payment for its ownership of the general partner of Oasis Midstream. The assets acquired in the Oasis Merger consist of the Rough Rider system and the Panther system, which are described below in “Description of Our Assets.” This transaction further solidifies Crestwood’s competitive position in the Williston and Delaware Basins and expands the Company’s relationship with Chord. Additionally, the Rough Rider system is complementary with our Arrow system, which has provided and continues to provide opportunities to drive cost savings, commercial synergies and better utilization of available gas processing capacity.
Sendero and CPJV Acquisitions
On July 11, 2022, we acquired Sendero, a privately-held midstream company for cash consideration of approximately $631 million (Sendero Acquisition). The Sendero assets, which consist of the Carlsbad system, are located in Eddy County, New Mexico and provide natural gas gathering, compression and processing services to customers in the Delaware Basin. Also, 
on July 11, 2022, we acquired First Reserve’s 50% equity interest in Crestwood Permian in exchange for approximately $6 million in cash and approximately 11.3 million newly issued CEQP common units (CPJV Acquisition). Prior to the CPJV Acquisition, we owned a 50% equity interest in Crestwood Permian, which we accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the CPJV Acquisition, we control and own 100% of the equity interests in Crestwood Permian. The assets acquired in the CPJV Acquisition consist of the Willow Lake, Orla and Desert Hills systems. The Sendero assets are complementary to Crestwood Permian’s assets and are being integrated with minimal capital investment, which we expect will enable the Company to capture substantial cost and commercial synergies. The Sendero Acquisition and the CPJV Acquisition significantly increased the Company’s position in the Delaware Basin. See “Description of Our Assets” below for further details on the Sendero and Crestwood Permian assets acquired.
Barnett and Marcellus Shale Divestitures
On July 1, 2022, we sold our assets in the Barnett Shale to EnLink Midstream, LLC (EnLink) for approximately $290 million, including working capital adjustments. The Barnett Shale assets consisted of our gathering and processing systems located in Hood, Somervell, Johnson, Tarrant and southern Denton Counties, Texas. On October 25, 2022, we sold our Marcellus Shale assets to Antero Midstream Corporation (Antero) for approximately $206 million. The Marcellus Shale assets consisted of gathering and compression systems in Harrison and Doddridge Counties, West Virginia. These divestitures represent a full exit of our gathering and processing operations in the Barnett and Marcellus Shales and allow the Company to focus on building and optimizing its assets in the Williston, Delaware and Powder River Basins, which best positions the Company to deliver long-term value to its unitholders.
Tres Holdings Divestiture
On February 20, 2023, we and BIF II Tres Palacios Aggregator (Delaware) LLC (Brookfield) entered into an agreement with a third party to sell each of our respective interests in Tres Holdings for total consideration of approximately $335 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.
For a further discussion of these strategic transactions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3 and Note 6.
Ownership Structure
The diagram below reflects a simplified version of our ownership structure as of December 31, 2022: 
Description of Our Assets 
We conduct our operations through Crestwood Midstream and its consolidated subsidiaries and our joint ventures. Our financial statements reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing north operations (includes our Williston Basin and Powder River Basin operations); (ii) gathering and processing south operations (includes our Delaware Basin operations and an equity method investment); and (iii) storage and logistics operations (includes our crude oil, NGL and natural gas storage and logistics operations and two equity method investments).
Gathering and Processing North Segment
Our gathering and processing north operations provide natural gas gathering, compression, treating and processing services, crude oil gathering and storage services and produced water gathering and disposal services to producers in the Williston Basin and Powder River Basin. Our gathering and processing north segment’s operating assets consist of: (i) natural gas facilities with approximately 818 MMcf/d of gathering capacity and approximately 775 MMcf/d of processing capacity; (ii) crude oil facilities with approximately 250 MBbls/d of gathering capacity and 496,000 Bbls of storage capacity; and (iii) produced water facilities with approximately 421 MBbls/d of gathering and disposal capacity.
Williston Basin
We own and operate the Arrow and Rough Rider systems which consist of integrated crude oil, rich natural gas and produced water gathering systems, natural gas processing facilities (Bear Den and Wild Basin), crude oil storage facilities and produced water disposal facilities. The Arrow and Rough Rider systems are located in the core of the Bakken Shale primarily in McKenzie and Dunn Counties, North Dakota, with the Arrow system primarily located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. 
The Rough Rider system connects to the Arrow crude oil system and is capable of transporting all of its crude oil volumes to the Arrow system. The Arrow system currently connects to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), Kinder Morgan Inc. (Kinder Morgan) Hiland, Tesoro High Plains Pipeline Company LLC (Tesoro) and True Companies’ Bridger Four Bears pipelines, providing significant downstream delivery capacity for our Arrow and Rough Rider customers. Additionally, we can transport Arrow and Rough Rider crude oil volumes to our COLT Hub facility by pipeline or truck, which mitigates the impact of any potential pipeline shut-downs to our producers with the ability to access multiple markets out of the basin. In addition to the multiple pipeline take-away outlets, the Arrow and Rough Rider systems have 496,000 Bbls of crude oil working storage capacity. 
Powder River Basin
We own and operate the Jackalope rich natural gas gathering system, the Continental Express high pressure pipeline and the Bucking Horse gas processing facility in Converse County, Wyoming.

Our gathering and processing south segment provides services under a variety of contracts. Although the cash flows from these operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with remaining terms ranging from 1 - 14 years, the results of our operations are significantly influenced by the volumes gathered and processed through our systems. The cash flows from these operations can also be impacted in the short term by changing commodity prices, seasonality, weather fluctuations and the financial condition of our customers. Our election to enter primarily into fixed-fee contracts subject to acreage dedications helps minimize our long-term exposure to commodity prices and their impact on the financial condition of our customers and provides us more stable operating performance and cash flows.
Storage and Logistics Segment
Our storage and logistics operations provide NGL, crude oil and natural gas storage, terminal, marketing and transportation (including rail, truck and pipeline) services to producers, refiners, marketers, utilities and other customers.
Below is a description of our storage and logistics operating assets, including those of our equity method investments.
•NGL Storage Facilities. Consists of approximately 10 MMBbls of NGL storage capacity located in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Mississippi, Michigan, New York and Indiana, with receipts and deliveries that are supported by both rail cars and third party pipelines, allowing truck and rail access to local markets.
•NGL Terminals and Transportation. Includes a fleet of rail and rolling stock with approximately 1.6 MMBbls/d of NGL pipeline, terminal and transportation capacity, which also includes our rail-to-truck terminals located in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, North Carolina, South Carolina and Mississippi. We provide hauling services to customers primarily in the Central Mid-Continent and East Coast of the United States.
•COLT Hub. The COLT Hub consists of our integrated crude oil loading, storage and pipeline terminal located in the heart of the Williston Basin in Williams County, North Dakota. The COLT Hub has approximately 1.2 MMBbls of crude oil storage capacity and 160,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity. Customers can source crude oil for rail loading through interconnected gathering systems, a twelve-bay truck unloading rack and the COLT Connector, a 21-mile 10-inch bi-directional proprietary pipeline that connects the COLT terminal to our storage tank facility at Dry Fork (Beaver Lodge/Ramberg junction). The COLT Hub is connected to the Meadowlark Midstream Company, LLC crude oil pipeline, Kinder Morgan Hiland crude oil pipelines and the DAPL interstate pipeline system at the COLT terminal, and the Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. and Marathon interstate pipeline systems at Dry Fork. The pipelines and truck unloading racks connected to the COLT Hub can deliver up to approximately 290,000 Bbls/d of crude oil to our terminal.
•Natural Gas Storage Facility. We own a 50.01% equity interest in Tres Holdings, a joint venture between CMLP Tres Manager LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Brookfield, which owns the remaining 49.99% equity interest in Tres Holdings. Tres Palacios Gas Storage LLC (Tres Palacios), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tres Holdings, owns a FERC-certificated 34.9 Bcf multi-cycle salt dome natural gas storage facility located in Markham, Texas, with a FERC-certificated maximum injection rate of 1,000 MMcf/d and a maximum withdrawal rate of 2,500 MMcf/d. The Tres Palacios natural gas storage facility’s 63-mile, 24-inch diameter header system (including a 38-mile dual 24-inch diameter system, a 20-mile north pipeline lateral and an approximate 5-mile south pipeline lateral) interconnects with 12 pipeline systems and can receive residue gas from the tailgate of Kinder Morgan’s Houston central processing plant.
•Powder River Basin Crude Oil Facilities. We own a 50.01% equity interest in Powder River Basin Industrial Complex, LLC (PRBIC), a joint venture between Crestwood Crude Logistics LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary and Twin Eagle Powder River Basin, LLC (Twin Eagle). PRBIC owns an integrated crude oil loading, storage and pipeline terminal located in Douglas County, Wyoming. PRBIC, which is operated by Twin Eagle, sources crude oil production from Powder River Basin producers through an eight-bay truck unloading rack. The PRBIC facility includes 20,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity and 380,000 Bbls of crude oil working storage capacity. The pipeline terminal includes connections to Kinder Morgan’s Double H Pipeline system and Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.’s (Plains) Rocky Mountain Pipeline system.
The table below summarizes certain contract information about our COLT Hub operations, our Tres Holdings equity investment and our PRBIC equity investment as of December 31, 2022:

Facility | Type of Contracts(1) | Weighted Average Remaining Contract Terms | Major Customers 
COLT | Fixed-Fee, Firm | Less than 1 year | BP Products North America, Inc (BP), Flint Hills Resources
Tres Palacios | Firm(2) | 2 years | BP, Trafigura Trading LLC 
PRBIC | Fixed-Fee, Firm | Less than 1 year | Texon L.P. 

(1)Fixed-fee contracts represent contracts in which our customers agree to pay a flat rate based on the amount of crude oil transported or stored. Firm contracts represent contracts whereby our customers agree to pay for a specified amount of storage or transportation capacity, whether or not the capacity is utilized.
(2)Tres Palacios has approximately 29.2 Bcf of firm storage contracts at December 31, 2022.
The cash flows from our COLT Hub operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with terms ranging from six months to one year. Our current cash flows from crude-by-rail facilities are supported by contracts with refiners and marketers. The rates and durations of the contracts associated with our crude oil terminals have eroded as pipelines have come on-line that make crude-by-rail options less economical, which impacts our cash flows from operations. The cash flows from our Tres 
Palacios joint venture are predominantly fee-based under contracts with remaining terms ranging from one to six years. Cash flows from interruptible and other hub services provided by our Tres Palacios joint venture tend to increase during the peak winter season. The cash flows from our other storage and logistics operations represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts with durations of one year or less, and tend to be seasonal in nature due to customer profiles and their tendencies to purchase NGLs during peak winter periods.
Major Customers 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues. 
Competition 
Our gathering and processing operations compete for customers based on reputation, operating reliability and flexibility, price, creditworthiness, and service offerings, including interconnectivity to producer-desired takeaway options (i.e., processing facilities and pipelines). We face strong competition in acquiring new supplies in the production basins in which we operate, and competition customarily is impacted by the level of drilling activity in a particular geographic region and fluctuations in commodity prices. Our primary competitors include other midstream companies with gathering and processing operations and producer-owned systems, and certain competitors enjoy first-mover advantages over us and may offer producers greater gathering and processing efficiencies, lower operating costs and more flexible commercial terms. 
Natural gas storage and pipeline operators compete for customers primarily based on geographic location, which determines connectivity and proximity to supply sources and end-users, as well as price, operating reliability and flexibility, available capacity and service offerings. Our primary competitors in our natural gas storage market include other independent storage providers and major natural gas pipelines with storage capabilities embedded within their transmission systems. Our primary competitors in the natural gas transportation market include major natural gas pipelines and intrastate pipelines that can transport natural gas volumes between interstate systems. Long-haul pipelines often enjoy cost advantages over new pipeline projects with respect to options for delivering greater volumes to existing demand centers, and new projects and expansions proposed from time to time may serve the markets we serve and effectively displace the service we provide to customers. 
Our crude oil rail terminals primarily compete with crude oil pipelines and other midstream companies that own and operate rail terminals in the markets we serve. The crude oil logistics business is characterized by strong competition for supplies, and competition is based largely on customer service quality, pricing, and geographic proximity to customers and other market hubs. 
Our NGL marketing and logistics business competes primarily with integrated major oil companies, refiners and processors, and other energy companies that own or control transportation and storage assets that can be optimized for supply, marketing and logistics services. 
Regulation
Our operations and investments are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities. The regulatory burden on our operations increases our cost of doing business and, in turn, impacts our profitability. In general, midstream companies have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years.
Pipeline and Underground Storage Safety 
We are subject to pipeline safety regulations imposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline and storage facilities. All of our natural gas pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (NGPSA), and all of our NGL and crude oil pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (HLPSA).
These federal statutes and PHMSA regulations collectively impose numerous safety requirements on pipeline operators, such as the development of a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities and the implementation of pipeline integrity management programs. For example, pursuant to the authority under the NGPSA and 
HLPSA, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas, known as high consequence areas (HCAs) and moderate consequence areas (MCAs) along pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas. The HCAs for natural gas pipelines are predicated on high-population areas (which, for natural gas transmission lines, include Class 3 and 4 areas and, depending on the potential impacts of a risk event, may include Class 1 and 2 areas) whereas HCAs along crude oil and NGL pipelines are based on high-population density areas, in addition to certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. MCAs are attributable to natural gas pipelines and are based on high-population areas as well as certain principal, high-capacity roadways, though they do not meet the definition of a natural gas pipeline HCA. Integrity management programs require more frequent inspections and other preventative measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs and MCAs. 
We plan to continue testing under our pipeline integrity management programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines in accordance with PHMSA regulations. Notwithstanding our preventive and investigatory maintenance efforts, we may incur significant expenses if anomalous pipeline conditions are discovered or due to the implementation of more stringent pipeline safety standards resulting from new or amended legislation or agency rulemaking.
Legislation in the past decade has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. In particular, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (2011 Pipeline Safety Act), the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (2016 Pipeline Safety Act) and, most recently, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 (2020 Pipeline Safety Act). Each of these laws imposed increased pipeline safety obligations on pipeline operators. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, required PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. The 2020 Pipeline Safety Act reauthorized PHMSA through fiscal year 2023 and directed the agency to move forward with several regulatory initiatives, including obligating operators of non-rural gas gathering lines and new and existing transmission and distribution pipeline facilities to conduct certain leak detection and repair programs and to require facility inspection and maintenance plans to align with those regulations.
With the adoption of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act and the 2020 Pipeline Safety Act, there exist mandates for PHMSA to make pipeline safety requirements more stringent, which further impose added pipeline safety requirements on operators.
•Natural Gas Storage Facilities Rulemaking. In February and July 2020, PHMSA published final rules that amended the minimum safety issues applicable to natural gas storage facilities, including wells, wellbore tubing and casing, and added applicable reporting requirements. 
•Natural Gas Pipeline Rulemaking. In October 2019, PHMSA published a final rule for certain natural gas pipelines that imposes numerous requirements, including maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) reconfirmation and exceedance reporting, the integrity assessment of additional pipeline mileage found in MCAs and Class 3 and Class 4 non-HCAs by 2033 unless the pipeline cannot be modified to permit such accommodation, and the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. 
•Hazardous Liquids Rulemaking. In October 2019, PHMSA published a final rule that significantly extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines, including, for example, performance of periodic assessments and expanded use of leak detection systems, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to an HCA. Additionally, this final rule requires all hazardous liquid pipelines in or affecting an HCA to be capable of accommodating in line inspection tools by 2039 unless the pipeline cannot be modified to permit such accommodation. Moreover, this final rule extends annual, accident, and safety-related conditional reporting requirements to hazardous liquid gravity lines and certain gathering lines and imposes inspection requirements on hazardous liquid pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, floods, earthquakes or other similar events that are likely to damage infrastructure.
•Natural Gas Gathering Lines Rulemaking. In November 2021, PHMSA issued a final rule that will impose safety regulations on approximately 400,000 miles of previously unregulated onshore gas gathering lines that, among other things, provide criteria for inspection and repair of fugitive emissions, extend reporting requirements to all gas gathering operators and apply a set of minimum safety requirements to certain gas gathering pipelines with large diameters and high operating pressures.
•Natural Gas Pipeline Rulemaking. In August 2022, PHMSA issued a final rule that adjusted the repair criteria for pipelines in HCAs, created new repair criteria for pipelines in non-HCAs, strengthened corrosion control requirements, mandated pipeline inspections following extreme weather events, strengthened integrity management assessment requirements, and codified a management of change process.
Separately, in June 2021, PHMSA issued an Advisory Bulletin advising pipeline and pipeline facility operators of the 2020 Pipeline Safety Act’s mandate that they update their inspection and maintenance plans for the elimination of hazardous leaks and minimization of natural gas released from pipeline facilities by December 27, 2021. As required by the 2020 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA, together with state regulators, began their inspection of these plans in 2022 after holding a public information webinar in February 2022 that discussed key elements of the applicable regulations and provided a general overview of the review of such plans. 
We are evaluating the operational and financial impact related to one or more of these laws and PHMSA rules. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, and the 2020 Pipeline Safety Act, as well as any implementation of PHMSA regulations thereunder, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate pipelines, but most states are certified by the Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In practice, because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate pipelines, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. Our pipelines have operations and maintenance plans designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety requirements, and we do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. 
Natural Gas Gathering 
Natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from FERC jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of our facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline, and not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation. The FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided are not exempt from FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act and the facility provides interstate services, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, the services provided by such facility would be subject to FERC regulation. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the FERC.
States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, requirements prohibiting undue discrimination, and complaint-based rate regulation. Our natural gas gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which we operate. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer, or one source of supply over another source of supply, and generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas.
The states in which we operate gathering systems have adopted a form of complaint-based regulation, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. To date, these regulations have not had an adverse effect on our systems. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future, however, a failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.

Our equity investments’ natural gas pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation under the NGPSA. In response to the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA issued an interim final rule in December 2016 and a final rule in January 2020 imposing new safety-related requirements on downhole facilities (including wells, wellbore tubing and casing) of new and existing underground natural gas storage facilities. The final rule incorporates by reference two American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices which address construction, maintenance, risk management and integrity management procedures for underground storage facilities. To the extent we operate or manage natural gas storage facilities owned by our equity investments, we have evaluated the final interim rules and do not anticipate any significant impact on our equity investments or any significant increase in the costs of operating and maintaining natural gas storage facilities. 
The natural gas storage operations of Tres Palacios is subject to regulation by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act. Under the Natural Gas Act, the FERC has authority to regulate natural gas transportation services in interstate commerce, which includes natural gas storage services. The FERC exercises jurisdiction over (i) rates charged for services and the terms and conditions of service; (ii) the certification and construction of new facilities; (iii) the extension or abandonment of services and facilities; (iv) the maintenance of accounts and records; (v) the acquisition and disposition of facilities; (vi) standards of conduct between affiliated entities; and (vii) various other matters. Regulated natural gas companies are prohibited from charging rates determined by the FERC to be unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory, and both the existing tariff rates and the proposed rates of regulated natural gas companies are subject to challenge.
The rates and terms and conditions of Tres Palacios’ operations are found in its FERC-approved tariff. Tres Palacios is authorized to charge and collect market-based rates for storage services. Market-based authority allows companies to negotiate rates with individual customers based on market demand. A loss of market-based authority or any successful complaint or protest against the rates charged or provided by Tres Palacios could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Natural Gas Act to (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has the authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERC rules, regulations and orders, up to approximately $1.5 million per day, per violation.
Subsurface Injection 
Our produced and flowback water underground injection operations are subject to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and analogous state laws and regulations. Pursuant to the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record-keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require us to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate our underground injection wells. States may add more stringent restrictions on the operation of injection wells when a permit is renewed or amended, which may result in material expenditures or impose significant restraints or financial assurances on our operations. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of UIC permits, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third parties claiming damage for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. 
There exists a concern amongst certain public and federal and state agencies that the injection of produced and flowback water into below ground disposal wells may trigger seismic activity. In response to concerns identified by a 2016 United States Geological Survey, some federal and state agencies have investigated and continue to investigate whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. Also, regulators in some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, additional requirements related to seismic safety, including the permitting of disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells, which has resulted in some states restricting, suspending, or shutting down the use of such injection wells. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission (TRCC) has adopted rules governing the permitting or re-permitting of wells used to dispose of produced and flowback water and other fluids resulting from the production of crude oil and natural gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns with the state. Also, North Dakota agencies requires a map depicting the area around the location where the disposal well is proposed that depicts any known or suspected faults. 
Freshwater Distribution
As freshwater availability becomes more limited, the regulatory restrictions on the use of freshwater may become more stringent. This could lead to increased flowback and produced water disposal costs. Some states have considered mandating the recycling of produced and flowback water. If such laws are passed, our producer customers may divert some produced and flowback water to recycling operations that may have otherwise been disposed of at our facilities, which could reduce the demand for our services. In addition, our sales of residual crude oil collected as part of the produced and flowback water injection process may impose liability on us in the event that the entity to which the crude oil was transferred fails to manage and dispose of residual crude oil in accordance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws.
Crude Oil and NGL Transportation
The transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids by common carrier pipelines on an interstate basis is subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. The ICA and FERC regulations also require that such rates be just and reasonable, and to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner so as to not confer undue preference upon any shipper. Certain of our pipelines are considered common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the FERC under the ICA. 
The transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids by common carrier pipelines on an intrastate basis is subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate crude oil and natural gas liquids pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil and natural gas liquids pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Intrastate common carriers must also offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. Certain of our pipelines are intrastate common carriers under the laws of the state in which they are located. We believe that the regulation of our intrastate crude oil pipeline and natural gas liquids pipelines will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operation of our competitors. 
Certain of our crude oil operations located in North Dakota are subject to state regulation by the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC). For example, gas conditioning requirements established by the NDIC recently will require operators of crude by rail terminals to report to the NDIC any crude volumes received for loading that exceed federal vapor pressure limits. State legislation has been proposed that, if passed, would authorize and require the NDIC to promulgate regulations under which produced water pipelines would be required to, among other things, install leak detection facilities and post bonds to cover potential remediation costs associated with releases. Moreover, the regulation of our customers’ production activities by the NDIC impacts our operations. For example, the NDIC approved additional requirements relating to site construction, underground gathering pipelines, spill containment, bonding for underground gathering pipelines and construction of berms around facilities. Additionally, the NDIC issued an order wherein the agency adopted legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” requiring our customers to capture certain percentages of natural gas produced by specified dates (the Gas Capture Order). The Gas Capture Order was subsequently modified in 2018. Exploration and production operators in the state may be required to install new equipment to satisfy these goals, and any failure by operators to meet these gas capture percentage goals would subject those operators to production restrictions, which could reduce the amount of commodities we gather on the Arrow system from our customers, and have a corresponding adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Our assets in Texas include intrastate common carrier NGL pipelines subject to the regulation of the TRRC, which requires that our NGL pipelines file tariff publications containing all the rules and the regulations governing the rates and charges for services we perform. TRRC regulations also require that pipeline rates be nondiscriminatory and provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services.
We cannot, however, provide assurance that the FERC will not, at some point, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of our crude oil or natural gas liquids pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for common carrier pipelines, or are otherwise not exempt from the FERC’s filing or reporting requirements, or that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations. In the event the FERC were to determine that our crude oil or natural gas liquids pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for common carrier pipelines, or otherwise would not qualify for a waiver from the FERC’s applicable regulatory requirements, we would likely be required to (i) file a tariff with the FERC; (ii) provide a cost justification for the transportation charge; (iii) provide regulated services to all potential shippers without undue discrimination; and (iv) potentially be subject to fines, penalties or other sanctions for violations of the ICA and the FERC’s regulations thereunder.
Portions of our Arrow gathering system, which is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, may be subject to applicable regulation by the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation. An entirely separate and distinct set of laws and regulations may apply to operators and other parties within the boundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American lands. These regulations include lease provisions, environmental standards, tribal employment preferences and numerous other matters.
Native American tribes are subject to various federal statutes and oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the BLM. However, Native American tribes possess certain inherent authorities to enact and enforce their own internal laws and regulations as long as such laws and regulations do not supersede or conflict with such federal statutes. These tribal laws and regulations may include various fees, taxes and requirements to extend preference in employment to tribal members or Indian owned businesses. Further, lessees and operators within a Native American reservation may be subject to the pertinent Native American judiciary system, or barred from litigating matters adverse to the pertinent tribe unless there is a specific waiver of the tribe’s sovereign immunity. Therefore, we may be subject to various applicable laws and regulations pertaining to Native American oil and gas leases, fees, taxes and other burdens, obligations and issues unique to oil and gas operations within Native American reservations. One or more of these applicable regulatory requirements, or delays in obtaining necessary approvals or permits necessary to operate on tribal lands, may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the economic viability of any well or project within a Native American reservation. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will always be able to renew existing rights-of-way or obtain new rights-of-way in Native American lands without experiencing significant costs. For example, following a decision by the Federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals that relied, in part, on a previous Federal Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, tribal ownership of even a very small fractional interest in an allotted land, that is, tribal land owned or at one time owned by an individual Native American landowner, bars condemnation of any interest in the allotment. Consequently, the inability to condemn such allotted lands under circumstances where an existing pipeline’s rights-of-way may soon lapse or terminate serves as an additional impediment for pipeline operators.
In recent years, PHMSA and other federal agencies have reviewed the adequacy of transporting Bakken crude oil by rail transport and, as necessary, have pursued rules to better assure the safe transport of Bakken crude oil by rail. For example, PHMSA adopted a final rule that includes, among other things, providing new sampling and testing requirements to improve classification of Bakken crude oil transported. Additionally in 2016, PHMSA published a final rule mandating a phase-out schedule for all DOT-111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol, between 2018 and 2029 and, more recently in February 2019, PHMSA published a final rule requiring railroads to develop and submit comprehensive oil spill response plans for specific route segments traveled by a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tanks of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train. Additionally, that February 2019 final rule requires railroads to establish geographic response zones along various rail routes, ensure that both personnel and equipment are staged and prepared to respond in the event of an accident and share information about high-hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response commissions. We, as the owner of a Bakken crude oil loading terminal, may be adversely affected to the extent more stringent rail transport rules result in more significant operating costs in the shipment of Bakken crude oil by rail or as a result of delays or limitations of such shipments. 
The transportation of NGLs by truck is subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations, which are administered by the United States Department of Transportation, cover the transportation of hazardous materials.
NGL Storage 
Our NGL storage terminals are subject to federal, state and local regulation. For example, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (INDNR), the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) and the EPA have jurisdiction over the underground storage of NGLs and NGL related well drilling, well conversions and well plugging in Indiana, New York and Michigan, respectively. The INDNR regulates aspects of our Seymour facility, the NYSDEC and EPA regulate aspects of the Bath facility and the EGLE and EPA regulate aspects of our Alto facility. Additionally, NGL terminals have the potential to be subject to state and federal air compliance regulations. For example, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the EPA have jurisdiction over facilities with the potential to emit regulated air pollutants in Pennsylvania. The PADEP regulates those aspects of the Schaefferstown facility. 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters 
Our operations and the operations of our equity investments are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge and emission of pollutants into the environment, environmental protection or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations may impose significant obligations on our operations, including (i) the need to obtain permits to conduct regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; (iii) apply workplace health and safety standards for the benefit of employees; (iv) require remedial activities or corrective actions to mitigate pollution from former or current operations; and (v) impose substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the (i) assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; (ii) imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; (iii) occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in permitting or the development of projects; and (iv) issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of the activities in a particular area. 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing federal environmental laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which our business operations and the operations of our equity investments are subject:
•The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a remedial statute that imposes strict liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
•The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the generation, treatment, storage and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes;
•The Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, monitoring and reporting requirements and that serves as a legal basis for the EPA to adopt climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
•The Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;
•The Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of substances into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources; 
•The National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment and which may require the preparation of Environmental Assessments or detailed Environmental Impact Statements to be made available for public review and comment;
•The Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered or threatened species, or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal or permanent ban in affected areas; and
•The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances and appropriate control measures.
Certain of these federal environmental laws, as well as their state counterparts, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore properties where pollutants have been released regardless of whom may have caused the harm or whether the activity was performed in compliance with all applicable laws. States also adopt and implement their own environmental laws and regulations, which may be more stringent than federal requirements. In the course of our operations, generated materials or wastes may have been spilled or released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials or wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, many of the properties owned or leased by us were previously operated by third parties whose management, disposal or release of materials and wastes was not under our control. Accordingly, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up or remediating contamination arising out of our operations or as a result of activities by others who previously occupied or operated on properties now owned or leased by us. Private parties, including the owners of properties that we lease and facilities where our materials or wastes are taken for recycling or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. We may not be able to recover some or any of these additional costs from insurance.
It is also possible that adoption of stricter environmental laws and regulations or more stringent interpretation of existing environmental laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs or liabilities to us as well as the industry in general or otherwise adversely affect demand for our services. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, making the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone more stringent. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone and, in December 2020, published notice of a final action to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, several groups have filed litigation over this December 2020 decision and, in January 2021, the Biden Administration announced plans to reconsider the December 2020 final action in favor of a more stringent ground-level ozone NAAQS. The Department of Justice has requested that any such legal challenges, therefore, be held in abeyance until the EPA completes its reconsideration. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers' equipment, resulting in longer permitting timelines, and could significantly increase our or our customers' capital expenditures and operating costs. 
In another example, there continues to be uncertainty on the federal government’s applicable jurisdictional reach under the Clean Water Act over “waters of the United States,” including wetlands. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) under the Obama, Trump and Biden Administrations have pursued multiple rulemakings since 2015 in an attempt to determine the scope of such reach, and in several instances, federal courts have vacated these rulemakings. In the third quarter of 2021, two federal district courts in Arizona and New Mexico vacated the Trump Administration’s 2020 rule, which resulted in a return to protections that were in place prior to the 2015 rulemaking revisions under the Obama Administration. In December 2022, the EPA and Corps released a final revised definition of “waters of the United States” founded upon the pre-2015 definition and including updates to incorporate existing Supreme Court decisions and agency guidance, and the new rule was officially published on January 18, 2023, to be effective on March 20, 2023. However, the new rule has already been challenged, with the State of Texas and industry groups filing separate suits in federal court in Texas on January 18, 2023. Moreover, in October 2022, the Supreme Court heard arguments in Sackett v. EPA, which involves issues relating to the legal tests used to determine whether wetlands are “waters of the United States.” The Supreme Court is expected to release an opinion in this case in 2023, which could impact the regulatory definition and its implementation. The implementation of the final rule and the potential expansion of the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers conduct operations could lead to project development delays, restrictions or cancellations, result in longer permitting timelines, or increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for our and our customers’ operations, which may reduce the rate of production from operators.
Separately, Nationwide Permit (NWP) 12, one of the Corps’ general permits that provides an avenue for streamlined authorization under the Clean Water Act Section 404 for certain oil and gas pipeline activities, has been subject to legal challenges and regulatory revision in recent years. The Corps reissued NWP 12 in January 2021 for a five-year period, but this permit is being challenged in federal court on the same grounds that were litigated in Northern Plains Resource Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In that case, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana previously found the permit unlawful and vacated it, though on appeal, the Supreme Court limited vacatur to only the pipeline at issue in the litigation. In addition, the Corps announced on March 28, 2022, that it was commencing a formal review of NWP 12 to ensure consistency with the Biden Administration’s commitments on potential impacts to disadvantaged communities, climate change, and other issues. Although the full extent and impact of the ongoing litigation and agency action with respect to the issued NWP 12 is unclear at this time, any disruption in our ability to obtain coverage under NWP 12 or other similar general permits may result in increased costs and project delays if we are forced to seek individual permits from the Corps.
Another permitting and development constraint occurs as a result of the protections afforded under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and comparable state laws, which restrict crude oil and natural gas-related activities that may affect endangered or threatened species. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) under the Trump Administration issued a final rule on January 7, 2021 which notably clarifies that criminal liability under the MBTA will apply only to actions “directed at” migratory birds, their nests, or their eggs; however, in October 2021, the FWS under the Biden Administration revoked the Trump Administration’s rule on incidental take and published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to codify a general prohibition on incidental take while establishing a process to regulate or permit exceptions to such a prohibition. A notice of proposed rulemaking is scheduled for release in 2023. To the extent that protected species live in the areas where we operate, our ability to conduct or expand operations and construct facilities could be limited or could force us to incur significant additional costs. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for crude oil and natural gas development. In addition, the FWS may make new determinations on the listing of species as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The dunes sagebrush lizard and the lesser prairie chicken are examples of species 
where new protections could impact our operations. In August 2022, the FWS filed a stipulated settlement agreement in a case challenging its failure to timely make a twelve-month finding on a petition to list the dunes sagebrush lizard. Under the agreement, the FWS will submit a twelve-month finding on the petition no later than June 29, 2023. The FWS also published a final rule on November 22, 2022, listing one Distinct Population Segment of the lesser prairie chicken species as threatened, and a second Distinct Population Segment as endangered, with these new designations going into effect on March 27, 2023. The designation of previously undesignated species as endangered or threatened could cause us to incur additional costs or cause our operations to become subject to restrictions or bans or limit future development activity in affected areas, thereby reducing demand for our services. 
Additionally, crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The NEPA requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency may prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement. Such environmental assessments and environmental impact statements are made available for public review and comment. On July 16, 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) under the Trump Administration published a final rule modifying the NEPA, and that rule remains subject to ongoing litigation in several federal district courts. The CEQ, now under the Biden Administration, issued a final rule in April 2022 retreating from several of these changes, one of which focused on ensuring that agency analysis captures the direct, indirect and cumulative effects of major federal actions. The Biden Administration considered these initial changes to be only “Phase 1” of its two-phased approach to modifying the NEPA regulations. “Phase 2” of this process remains underway, and although no details are yet public, it is likely that these revisions will result in increased agency scrutiny of major federal actions, including those associated with development of oil and gas resources. Additionally, in January 2023, the CEQ released guidance to assist federal agencies in assessing the GHG emissions and climate change effects of their proposed actions under the NEPA. The CEQ’s interim guidance is effective immediately and encourages agencies to consider, among other things, effects from upstream and downstream GHG emissions of fossil fuel projects. Implementation of these changes may result in further permitting delays.
In addition to the laws and regulations described above, the potential impact of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in other countries. President Biden has made action on climate change a priority of his administration’s agenda. At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. However, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA 2022) imposes fees on the emission of methane that exceed certain thresholds from sources rquired to report their GHG emissions to the EPA. Compliance with these rules or other initiatives could result in increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for our operations. Moreover, significant incentives for alternative clean energy investment could accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable and low carbon energy, which could in turn reduce demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business and results of operations. For more information on each of these climate change-related issues, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Our and our customers’ operations are subject to various risks arising out of the threat of climate change, energy conservation measures, or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy that could result in increased costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur and reduced demand for our services.”
Additionally, various states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the United Nations has sponsored the Paris Agreement, which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden announced in April 2021 a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50-52% from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. Moreover, the international community has made a number of announcements at both the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) and the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27) to include at the former, the launch of a Global Methane Pledge, an initiative which over 100 countries joined, committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. For more information on each of these climate change-related issues, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Our and our customers’ operations are subject to various risks arising out of the threat of climate change, energy conservation measures, or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy that could result in increased costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur and reduced demand for our services.”
Our access to capital may be impacted by climate change policies. Shareholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies such as ours but concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices that favor “clean” power sources, such 
as wind and solar, making those sources more attractive, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Many banks have made “net zero” carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions. These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and natural gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions may be pressured or required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies. While we cannot predict what policies may result from these announcements, a material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel energy industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could impact our business and operations. For more information on each of these climate change-related issues, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Our and our customers’ operations are subject to various risks arising out of the threat of climate change, energy conservation measures, or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy that could result in increased costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur and reduced demand for our services.” Furthermore, the SEC released a proposed rule in March 2022 that would establish a framework for the reporting of climate risks, targets and metrics. Although the final form and substance of this proposed rule and its requirement are not yet known, and the ultimate impacts upon our business is uncertain, the proposed rule, if finalized, may result in increased compliance costs and increased costs of and restrictions on access to capital. Separately, the SEC has also announced that it is scrutinizing existing climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC were to allege that an issuer’s existing climate disclosures are misleading or deficient. 
Increasing attention to climate change, societal expectations for companies to address climate change, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, and customer demand for alternative forms of energy may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our services, reduced profits, increased risks of governmental investigations and private party litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change and environmental conservation, for example, may result in demand shifts from oil and natural gas products and bias against companies operating in the sector. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business.”
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 753 full-time employees, 280 of which were general and administrative employees and 473 of which were operational employees. Our ability to attract, develop, retain and keep our employees safe is critical to the operational performance and future sustainability of our company. 
We believe our ability to attract employees is significantly influenced by our efforts to create a culture founded on respect and collaboration, and our ability to value the diverse backgrounds, skills and contributions that our employees offer. Our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) is advanced by our Chief Diversity Officer and our internal DE&I committee pursuant to our DE&I five-point plan with the key pillars of attracting talent for a diverse workforce, creating an inclusive and engaged workforce, focusing on sustainability and accountability, creating meaningful DE&I-related partnerships, and building the future pipeline of employees with DE&I in mind. During 2022, we demonstrated our commitment to DE&I by conducting indigenous cultural awareness training for a second consecutive year and granting internships and scholarships where 60% of the participants were from diverse backgrounds. Each of these DE&I accomplishments were factored into our employees’ short-term incentive compensation for 2022 and 2021, and we were able to meet or exceed the targeted goals for each of those areas during both years. 
We develop our employees through a comprehensive performance management program and through continuous training, especially as it relates to safety, operations, technology, human resources and ethics and compliance. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 100% and 99.9% of our employees completed their assigned training in these areas.
We monitor our ability to retain our employees through our voluntary turnover rate (the percentage of employees who voluntarily leave our organization compared to our total employee population), which was 13% and 11% during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
We monitor our ability to keep our employees safe by setting company-wide goals each year as it relates to leading indicators (i.e., near miss reporting) and lagging indicators (i.e., incident and injury rates), certain of which are factored into our employees’ short-term incentive compensation each year. During 2022 and 2021, we exceeded all of our core safety goals and targets, and achieved a total recordable incident rate of 1.03 and 1.10, respectively, a days away restricted transferred rate of 
0.51 and 0.66, respectively, and a preventable vehicular incident rate of 0.89 and 0.66, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
