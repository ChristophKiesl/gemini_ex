In 2013, we defined three initiatives aimed at growing market verticals, which align well with our expertise. We called these initiatives Unified Communications, SmartHome, and SmartVoice, which together we referred to as “growth initiatives.” Our past research and development investments paid dividentds and our strategy with respect to such initiatives has proven successful. Starting in 2018, our growth initiatives accounted for a majority of our total revenues. Reflecting our success in turning growth initiatives into our core expertise, we changed the terminology for these market verticals that we operate in from “growth initiatives” to Internet of Audio Things or “IoAT” businesses.
 

In July 2020, we completed the acquisition of SoundChip SA, a privately-held Swiss company (“SoundChip”) for an initial purchase price of approximately $15 million and agreed to pay future contingent cash milestone payments of up to $6 million upon the achievement of certain customer and product sales. SoundChip is a leading supplier of active noise cancellation (ANC) technology, engineering services, design tools and production-line test systems for headsets. The acquisition combines SoundChip’s proven capabilities in hybrid ANC with our SmartVoice™ advanced low-power voice processing platform, algorithms, and mixed-signal expertise to streamline the delivery of cutting-edge wireless and true wireless stereo (TWS) headsets, from concept through to manufacturing. SoundChip operations were consolidated as of July 1, 2020t and are included in the SmartVoice segment.
 
In 2020, revenues from our IoAT businesses accounted for 60% of our total revenues.
 
We were incorporated in California in 1987 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1994. We completed our initial public offering in February 1994.
 
Industry Environment and Our Business
 
The COVID-19 outbreak we faced in 2020 presented an unprecedented global challenge affecting every aspect of our lives, including, of course, the semiconductor industry. Our technical solutions are playing a significant role in enabling the technological trends that were accelerated as a result of the pandemic. For instance, with more employees working remotely, and offices reconfiguring workspaces to cater to social distancing requirements, high-quality communication and remote collaboration tools have become essential. Moreover, individuals worldwide became very aware of and sensitive to the health risks of touching commonly used surfaces. This awareness has accelerated the adoption of voice user interfaces (VUIs) for a broad array of products, beyond the original value propositions of convenience and functionality. We believe DSP Group is well positioned to leverage its leadership in Unified Communications, SmartVoice and SmartHome technologies with world-class technologies and innovative solutions that address the increasing demands of these markets.

Our focus on the design of highly-integrated, mixed-signal devices that combine signal processing, complex RF (radio frequency), analog and digital functions enables us to address the complex challenges of integrating various technologies, platforms and processes posed by emerging industry trends. Our IC products are customizable and achieve high functionality and performance at reduced power consumption. This is especially important for Internet of Things (IoT), home automation devices, mobile, hearables, wearables, cordless and IP telephony products that require very low power consumption, and can be manufactured in high volumes using cost-effective process technologies. Our system level architectures provide an open design environment for ODMs to design and market their own differentiated end products.
 

Our expertise and investment in software development, including Board Support Packages (BSPs) and drivers, telephony, communication stacks and application layers in Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and Full Featured Operating System (FFOS) frameworks, enable our customers’ fast time to market with cost- and performance-optimized flexible solutions. With our internally developed innovations and acquired intellectual property, we deliver value to our existing market verticals and address new market verticals, including markets for IoT, office phones, mobile, hearables and wearables, consumer and computing devices, and voice user interface, thus expanding our market opportunities.
 
We offer leading wireless voice and data transmission system solutions for various connectivity applications in the home and enterprise. Since 1999, to address our customer requirements, we have developed and acquired a broad set of communication technologies, including Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS), Orthogonal Frequency Digital Modulation (OFDM), Digital Narrow Band, Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) technology, and Silicon Germanium (SiGe) RF chips for 900MHz, 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz Industry Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands, European DECT (1.9GHz), DECT 6.0 (1.8GHz), Korean DECT (1.7GHz), Bluetooth (2.4GHz), Wi‑Fi (802.11, 2.4GHz/5GHz), BiCMOS (Bipolar CMOS) and deep sub-micron CMOS technologies.
 
Moreover, we expanded our DECT solutions beyond cordless telephony to address the IoT market via an ultra-low energy version of DECT called DECT ULE or ULE. ULE offers numerous technological benefits due to its operation in licensed and interference-free bands, longer range, RF robustness, propagation through multiple walls, voice and data support, while consuming very low power. ULE is built from the ground up to support two-way voice and audio transport, making it ideal for today’s voice-enabled SmartHome.
 
Over the past decade, we have expanded from primarily delivering cordless telephony solutions serving consumers to chipsets and telephony solutions for office and business applications to becoming a market leader in the Office segment. Today, DSP Group offers comprehensive system-on -chip (SoC) and solutions for VoIP, home, SoHo and office IP phones. VoIP is a technology that enables users to make HD voice and video calls via a broadband Internet connection rather than an analog phone line. Furthermore, with speech-enabled mobile, smart assistants and IoT devices playing an increasingly significant role in peoples’ lives, in February 2013, we unveiled our HDClear technology. We have incorporated this HDClear technology into our SmartVoice product family which consists of a comprehensive suite of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) embedded noise suppression and voice quality enhancement products for mobile, wearables, hearables and always-on IoT and SmartHome devices. HDClear capitalizes on the voice user interface trend by incorporating voice command, voice activation, proprietary noise cancellation, acoustic echo cancellation, and beam forming algorithms, thereby dramatically improving user experience and delivering leading voice quality and speech recognition. Our HDClear technology is both high performance and ultra-low power. In 2020, we achieved 4% year-over-year growth in the SmartVoice segment via a broad-based expansion with both existing and new customers across our target markets.

The SmartHome and cordless product lines are both part of our Home segment.
 
Below is a discussion of our business segments and the products within each segment.
 
SmartVoice - Products Targeted at Mobile Computing, Consumer Electronics, IoT, Wearable and Hearables Device Markets 
 
Our SmartVoice product portfolio encompasses HDClear technology for intelligent voice enhancement, always-on voice trigger and control, and noise cancellation. This technology is primarily targeted at devices supporting voice as a user interface. The current market trend is to use voice as a user interface in almost all devices. Our HDClear high-performance and lower-power solutions continue to achieve important design wins with our numerous enabling technologies such as voice command, voice activation, proprietary noise cancellation, acoustic echo cancellation, and beam forming algorithms, all of which dramatically improve the user experience and deliver world class voice quality and speech recognition.
 
HDClear-based solutions comprise of robust and powerful noise cancellation algorithms that effectively isolate voice from ambient noise. In doing so, HDClear delivers clearer voice calls and enables high mobile IoT voice quality and intelligibility. HDClear also maximizes the accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) applications by drastically lowering Word Error Rate (WER). This dramatically improves the user experience for speech-enabled applications like virtual assistants, voice search, speakerphone conference calls and speech-to-text on mobile and wearables, tablets, and other consumer devices.
 


Starting in 2012, we taped-out a number of voice-enhancment ICs that comprise the DBMD family, which we believe are the market’s most efficient voice-enhancement processors. We started with DBMD2, a low power chip, that provides always-on, natural-voice capabilities for mobile and wearable battery-powered devices. Average users access their devices tens or hundreds of times per day by physically pressing a screen or a button. A truly always-on technology lets the user skip this step by instead using natural voice to access the device—even while the device is in standby mode. By providing all the necessary hardware and software in a single solution, DBMD2 allows mobile OEMs to preserve battery life and to offload voice and audio tasks from a mobile device’s CPU, in addition to running HDClear to enhance ASR accuracy.
 
In 2015, we taped-out DBMD4, a chip targeted for ultra-low-power, always-on voice and audio applications. DBMD4 incorporates a suite of voice-enhancement algorithms, including noise suppression, which significantly improves the accuracy of speech-driven applications, particularly in high noise environments, thereby enhancing the user experience. Offered in a small form factor, DBMD4 embeds a TeakLite-III DSP core, incorporates advanced connectivity options, including I2S, UART, SPI, I2C ports and SLIMbus. It is also equipped with a comprehensive software framework that enables rapid development. As such, DBMD4 overcomes many of the demands of portable design, including small footprint, low power, and rapid time to market.

Backlog
 
At December 31, 2020, our backlog was approximately $65.8 million, compared to approximately $21.4 million and $23.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We include in our backlog all accepted product purchase orders with respect to which a delivery schedule has been specified for product shipment within one year and for which collectability is not considered a risk. Our business is characterized by short-term order and shipment schedules. Product orders in our current backlog are subject to change, sometimes on short notice, due to changes in delivery schedules or cancellation by a purchaser. Moreover, as the semiconductors industry is currently experiencing severe capacity and supply chain constraints, our ability to deliver this backlog within the timetable requested by our customers could be uncertain. Moreover, these industry-wide supply chain constraints are known to our customers which may have resulted in inflated backlog that may not necessarily represent real end-market demand. Accordingly, although useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of our sales for any future period.
Employees
 
Core Principles
 
We believe our employees are key to our success and we are committed to all of our employees’ engagement, training and career development, and personal and professional growth. Our Board of Directors also receives regular updates from senior management on matters relating to our strategy associated with the recruitment, retention and development of our employees. We provide training in technical and operational, and managerial skills, and places special emphasis on safety, effective communications, customer service, and employee development.
Headcount
 
At December 31, 2020, we had 352 employees, including 211 in research and development, 74 in sales and marketing, and 67 in corporate, administration and manufacturing coordination. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
We are consciously expanding the diversity of our workforce, creating growth and development opportunities for our employees, embracing different perspectives and fostering an inclusive work environment.
Competition
 
Competition for personnel in the semiconductor industry in general is intense. We believe that our future prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain sought after, highly-skilled technical, marketing and management personnel and are taking active measures to ensure we are perceived as a sought after employer. In particular, there is a limited supply of RF chip designers and highly-qualified engineers with digital signal processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence experience. We believe that we provide an excellent culture, challenging work and competitive compensation to retain our valuable employees.
