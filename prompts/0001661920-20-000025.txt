Item 1. Business.
Overview
Lonestar is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company focused on the exploration, development and production of unconventional oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas in the Eagle Ford Shale (the "Eagle Ford") in South Texas.
We have accumulated approximately 72,642 gross (53,831 net) acres as of December 31, 2019. We operate in one industry segment, which is the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas liquids ("NGLs") and natural gas. Our current operational activities and consolidated revenues are generated from markets exclusively in the United States, and, as of December 31, 2019, we had no long-lived assets located outside the United States.
Our primary operational focus is on our Eagle Ford position in eleven Texas counties, and our properties in the Eagle Ford are divided into three distinct regions: the Western Eagle Ford (comprised of Dimmit, La Salle and Frio Counties), Central Eagle Ford (comprised of Gonzales, Karnes, Fayette, Wilson, DeWitt and Lavaca Counties) and Eastern Eagle Ford (comprised of Brazos and Robertson Counties). As of December 31, 2019, we operated 84% of our Eagle Ford position and approximately 93% of our net acreage was held by production, or HBP. Third-party engineers have identified 264 gross (176 net) horizontal drilling locations on our Eagle Ford acreage.
We currently plan to invest the majority of our 2020 capital budget in the horizontal development of our Eagle Ford properties and have allocated between $80 million and $85 million to drilling and completion activities to develop these assets. We have historically grown our Eagle Ford leasehold position through organic leasing activities, farm-ins, acquisitions, and other structures. We believe our management team’s extensive experience and our reputation as an operator in the basin provide us with relationships and contacts that could serve as a platform for expanded opportunities to grow our acreage footprint. 
We seek to deploy advanced drilling, completion and production techniques across our unconventional acreage with a goal of minimizing completed well costs and maximizing per-well hydrocarbon recoveries. Increasingly, we utilize 3-D seismic imaging to plan our lateral programs while utilizing log-based petrophysical analysis to optimize our drilling targets within distinct horizons within the Eagle Ford section. We are also frequently drilling laterals in excess of 7,000 feet in an effort to maximize per-well recoveries and economic returns. Further, we are utilizing thru-bit logging in our laterals to design non-geometric completions which allow for the use of diverters while increasing proppant concentrations in an effort to make our fracture stimulations more effective. Additionally, we employ active choke management to optimize pressure drawdowns in an effort to maximize liquid hydrocarbon recoveries.
The following table presents summary data for each of our primary project areas as of December 31, 2019:

(1) | Potential drilling locations are identified based on analysis of relevant geologic and engineering data. Our total identified drilling locations include 159 gross (123 net) locations that were associated with proved undeveloped reserves, or PUDs, as of December 31, 2019. The remaining drilling locations were not associated with proved reserves as of December 31, 2019, however, based on our analysis of our drilling results, the drilling results of offset operators and applicable geologic and engineering data, we believe these locations are prospective for development.


(2) | The drilling locations on which we actually drill will depend on the availability of capital, regulatory approval, commodity prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these identified locations may not be successful and may not result in our adding additional proved reserves to our existing reserves. See Risk Factors. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill such locations.


(3) | Planned Wells (Net) represents our optimal planned drilling results based on our currently budgeted capital expenditures.

Our Properties
Our Eagle Ford net production for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 15,187 BOE/d, comprised of 7,375 Bbls/d of oil, 3,749 Bbls/d of NGLs and 24,374 Mcf/d of natural gas, from 276 gross (215 net) producing wells.
In March, 2019, we sold our Pirate assets in Wilson County for $12.3 million, before closing adjustments, to a private third-party. The assets were comprised of 3,400 net undeveloped acres, six producing wells, held seven proved undeveloped locations as of the closing date and were producing approximately 200 BOE/d. 
In November 2018, we acquired additional oil and gas properties in DeWitt County for $38.7 million, before closing adjustments, from Sabine Oil & Gas Corporation and Alerion Gas AXA, LLC. The acquisition, which is 95% operated, included approximately 3,071 gross acres (2,693 net acres) and approximately 800 BOE/d of production from 20 producing wells on the date of the acquisition.
As of December 31, 2019, according to our reserve report, our Eagle Ford properties had proved reserves of 100.6 MMBOE, of which 74% was crude oil and NGLs and 31% was proved developed producing, or PDP. The Standardized Measure of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 was $738.8 million, and the PV-10(1) of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 was $834.2 million using SEC pricing, and 46% of such PV-10 was PDP. See Oil and Natural Gas Data below for more information. 
Third-party engineers have identified 264 gross (176 net) horizontal drilling locations on our acreage, of which 64% are expected to be drilled using lateral lengths of or greater than 7,000 feet and 89% are expected to be drilled using lateral lengths of, or greater than, 5,000 feet.
Western Eagle Ford. As of December 31, 2019, our Western Eagle Ford region was comprised of 16,028 gross (14,340 net) acres in Dimmit, La Salle and Frio Counties. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 90% of this acreage, and approximately 94% of this net acreage was HBP. We plan on allocating 43% of our 2020 capital budget to our Western Eagle Ford acreage.
Central Eagle Ford. Our Central Eagle Ford region, as of December 31, 2019, was comprised of 46,593 gross (32,992 net) acres in Gonzales, Karnes, Fayette and Wilson Counties. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 82% of this acreage, and approximately 92% of this net acreage was HBP. We plan on allocating 57% of our 2020 capital budget to this area.
Eastern Eagle Ford. Our Eastern Eagle Ford region, as of December 31, 2019, was comprised of 10,020 gross (6,499 net) acres in Brazos and Robertson Counties. Approximately 97% of this net acreage was HBP, and as of December 31, 2019, we operated 80% of this acreage. We do not plan on allocating any of our 2020 capital budget to our Eastern Eagle Ford acreage.
(1) PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash inflows using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each of the preceding twelve months. PV-10 differs from the Standardized Measure because it does not include the effect of future income taxes. See Oil and Natural Gas Data—PV-10 below for more information and a reconciliation of PV-10 to our Standardized Measure.

Recent Developments
Commodity Prices
Subsequent to December 31, 2019, oil prices have declined sharply. The coronavirus outbreak has weakened demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, and after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and a group of oil producing nations led by Russia failed in March 2020 to agree on oil production cuts, Saudi Arabia announced that it would cut oil prices and increase production, leading to a sharp further decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Due to the recent oil price volatility, we recently reduced our 2020 capital spending program by approximately 25% and will continue to evaluate going forward as conditions warrant.
Going Concern Assessment
As discussed under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our present level of indebtedness and the recent commodity price environment present challenges to our ability to comply with the covenants in our revolving credit facility and therefore substantial doubt exists that we will be able to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $506.2 million, including $250.0 million of Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), $247.0 million under our revolving credit facility and $8.9 million under our building loan.
Specifically, we did not satisfy the consolidated current ratio covenant under our revolving credit facility as of the December 31, 2019 measurement date and such failure represented an event of default under our revolving credit facility. In addition, we do not anticipate maintaining compliance with the consolidated current ratio covenant under our revolving credit facility over the next twelve months and, accordingly, the audit report prepared by our auditors with respect to the financial statements in this Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a “going concern.” The failure to maintain compliance with the consolidated current ratio in future fiscal quarters would represent an additional default under our revolving credit facility as of the end of any such future fiscal quarters. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty but have reclassified the outstanding amount of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2019 as current liabilities.
To address the defaults under our revolving credit facility, we have entered into the Limited Waiver and Eleventh Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Waiver”), effective as of April 7, 2020, with certain lenders and Citibank, N.A., as administrative bank, to waive the event of default arising from our failure to comply with the current ratio in the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2019 to obtain consent under the revolving credit facility to extend the deadline to provide our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and for such financial statements to include a “going concern” or like qualification or exception. Although we have entered into the Waiver, there is no guarantee that our lenders will agree to waive events of default or potential events of default in the future.
As we do not anticipate maintaining compliance with the consolidated current ratio covenant under our revolving credit facility over the next twelve months, we are evaluating the available financial alternatives, including obtaining acceptable alternative financing as well as seeking additional waivers or amendments to the covenants or other provisions of our revolving credit facility to address any future default. If, upon a future default, we are unable reach an agreement with our lenders or find acceptable alternative financing, the lenders under our revolving credit facility may choose to accelerate repayment, which in turn may result in an event of default and an acceleration of the 2023 Notes. We have concluded that these circumstances create substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. If we were able to reach an agreement with the lenders under our revolving credit facility so that we will likely be in compliance with the covenants of our revolving credit facility for the subsequent twelve months or are able to refinance the 2023 Notes, we believe we will be able to operate as a going concern. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach any such agreement or be able to refinance the 2023 Notes.

Business Strategies
Our primary business objective is to increase reserves, production and cash flows at attractive rates of return on invested capital. We are focused on exploiting long-lived, unconventional oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Key elements of our business strategy include:

• | Develop our Eagle Ford leasehold positions. We intend to continue developing our acreage position to maximize the value of our resource potential and generate returns for our stockholders through continuing to utilize best-in-class drilling and completion techniques at the lowest possible costs. Through the conversion of our resource base to developed reserves, we will seek to increase our production and cash flow, thereby increasing the value of our reserves. As of December 31, 2019, we were producing from 276 gross (215 net) Eagle Ford wells and we intend to deploy all our capital budget for 2020 on the development of our Eagle Ford acreage.


• | Pursue organic leasing, strategic acquisitions, and other structures to continue to develop and grow our production and leasehold position. We believe that we will be able to continue to identify and acquire additional acreage and producing assets in the Eagle Ford. By leveraging our longstanding relationships in this area, we intend to expand our Eagle Ford acreage. We also intend to continue to find creative ways to fund our continued development while maintaining financial discipline and seeking to maximize returns from our projects. We have successfully used farm-ins and drilling commitments as means of adding prospective Eagle Ford acreage by committing to drilling activity as opposed to deploying capital with lease acquisition costs. For example, in the past we have executed on this strategy through our Joint Development Agreement with IOG Capital L.P. (‘‘IOG’’). This agreement allowed for working interest-level participation with IOG participating on a promoted basis for funding farm-ins. This was a wellbore-only agreement that allowed us to develop acreage or hold expiring acreage while maintaining some upside through a specified return hurdle earn-in and all of the upside associated with future development of offsetting wells.


• | Leverage our extensive operational expertise and concentration of our operating areas to reduce costs and enhance returns. We are focused on continuously improving our operating measures. We intend to leverage the magnitude and concentration of our acreage within the Eagle Ford in our operating areas, as well as our experience within our areas of operation to capture economies of scale, including multiple-well pad drilling, and utilizing centralized production and fluid-handling facilities. Our management and operating team has significant industry and operating experience, and it regularly evaluates our operating measures against those of other operators in our area in order to improve our performance and identify additional opportunities to optimize our drilling and completion techniques and make informed decisions about our capital expenditure program and drilling activity.


• | Maintain operational control over our drilling and completion operations. We operate 84% of the Eagle Ford wells in which we have a working interest and intend to maintain a high degree of operational control over substantially all of our producing locations. We believe that continuing to exercise a high degree of control over our acreage position will provide us with flexibility to manage our drilling program and optimize our returns and profitability.


• | Maintain and enhance financial liquidity and flexibility. We intend to use cash on hand and, to the extent we cure any future defaults, borrowings from our revolving credit facility, combined with our cash flow from operations, to continue executing a capital expenditure program that we believe will help us achieve steady growth of production, cash flow and proved reserves. Furthermore, we intend to continue to employ a hedging strategy on our PDP production to achieve more predicable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. We regularly assess the futures markets for opportunities to enter into additional hedging contracts. Generally, we have entered into additional hedges when we believe that they are additive to our borrowing base and/or lock-in rates of return which exceed our hurdle rates. Further, we have strived to enter into unique and strategically-effective arrangements to reduce our outstanding indebtedness and improve our financial liquidity. We intend to continue to seek out such opportunities to improve our balance sheet and financial flexibility.

Our Competitive Strengths
We possess a number of competitive strengths that we believe will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies.

• | Geographic focus in one of North America’s leading unconventional oil plays. We have assembled a leasehold position of 53,831 net acres in the Eagle Ford as of December 31, 2019. We believe this unconventional oil and natural gas formation has one of the higher rates of return among such formations in North America. In addition to leveraging our technical expertise in our project areas, our geographically-concentrated acreage position allows us to establish economies of scale with respect to drilling, production, operating and administrative costs. Based on our drilling and production results and well-established offset operator activity in and around our project areas, we believe there are relatively low geologic risks and ample repeatable drilling opportunities across our core operating areas in the Eagle Ford where we have devoted all of our 2020 drilling capital budget.


• | Experienced management team. Our top eight executives average over 30 years of industry experience. We have assembled what we believe to be a strong technical staff of geoscientists, field operations managers and engineers with significant experience drilling horizontal wells including fracture stimulation of unconventional formations, which has resulted in reserve and production growth. In addition, our management team has extensive expertise and operational experience in the oil and natural gas industry with a proven track record of successfully negotiating, executing and integrating acquisitions. Members of our management team have previously held positions with major and large independent oil and natural gas companies.


• | Demonstrated ability to increase acreage position and drive growth of oil production and reserves. We have increased our Eagle Ford net acreage by over fourteen times, from 3,710 net acres in 2011 to 53,831 net acres as of December 31, 2019. We placed 17 gross (15.7 net) and 21 gross (18.3 net) Eagle Ford wells onstream during 2019 and 2018, respectively. We had a total of 276 gross (215 net) producing wells in the Eagle Ford, as of December 31, 2019. Our average total production for 2019 was 15,187 BOE/d, all of which was from the Eagle Ford. Between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, our total proved reserves increased by approximately 7.2 MMBOE, from 93.4 MMBOE to 100.6 MMBOE. Our proved developed reserves increased by approximately 6.1 MMBOE, from 26.9 MMBOE to 33.0 MMBOE. Our five-year average reserve replacement ratio is approximately 549%, which we believe demonstrates our ability to grow reserves year over year. We believe the location and concentration of our project areas within the Eagle Ford provide us an opportunity to continue to increase production, lower costs and further delineate our proved reserves.


• | Demonstrated ability to adapt and employ leading drilling and completion techniques. We are focused on enhancing our drilling, completion and production techniques to maximize recovery of hydrocarbons. Industry techniques, with respect to drilling and completion, have significantly evolved over the past several years, resulting in increased initial production rates and recoverable hydrocarbons per well through the implementation of longer laterals and more tightly-spaced fracture stimulation stages. We continuously evaluate industry results and methods and monitor the results of other operators to improve our operating practices, and we expect that our drilling and completion techniques will continue to improve and evolve. We have demonstrated a track record of innovation and operational improvement in the past through our partnership with Schlumberger, the Geo-Engineered Completion Alliance (“GECA”). This Alliance utilized a variety of technologies intended to focus our wells in precise, optimal intervals of the Eagle Ford and utilize analysis of advanced logs run through the laterals to assist in the design of non-geometric fracture stimulation stages, which in combination with diverters, were intended to stimulate a greater percentage of the lateral on a cost-effective basis. We continue to use these technologies which can be provided by several energy service companies.


• | Multi-year drilling inventory in existing and emerging resource plays. Third-party engineers have identified 264 gross (176 net) horizontal drilling locations on our Eagle Ford acreage. As of December 31, 2019, these identified drilling locations included 159 gross (123 net) locations to which we have assigned proved undeveloped reserves. We believe our acreage is prospective for additional locations and plan to continue evaluating this acreage and monitoring industry activity in order to maximize our efficiency in developing this acreage. Furthermore, we are evaluating our acreage to identify and develop additional locations across our portfolio as we evaluate down-spacing in the Eagle Ford and accessing other stratigraphic horizons that lie above and below the Eagle Ford, such as the Austin Chalk, Buda, Georgetown, Woodbine and Wilcox formations. We believe our multi-year drilling inventory and exploration portfolio will help provide near-term growth in our production and reserves and highlight the long-term resource potential across our asset base.

• | Low field operating expenses. Even in light of low oil prices, we expect to generate sufficient cash margins on the operation of our Eagle Ford acreage due to our low cash operating costs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our total field operating expenses (including lease operating and gas gathering expenses of $6.60 per BOE, and production and ad valorem taxes of $2.01 per BOE) totaled $8.61 per BOE in our project areas.


• | Hedging position. As of December 31, 2019, we had oil derivative contracts in place for 2020 covering approximately 7,480 Bbls/d at an average price of $56.95 per Bbl. In addition, we currently have oil derivative contracts in place for 2021 consisting of 7,000 Bbls/d at an average price of $50.40 per Bbl. As of December 31, 2019, we also had derivative contracts to hedge our 2020 natural gas production covering 20,000 MMBtu/d at a weighted average price of $2.58 per MMBtu. In addition, we currently have natural gas derivative contracts in place for 2021 consisting of 27,500 MMBtu/d at a weighted average price of $2.36 per MMBtu. We believe that these hedges help mitigate our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility. 

Oil and Natural Gas Data
Estimated Proved Reserves
The following table presents estimated net proved oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties and the Standardized Measure amounts associated with the estimated proved reserves attributable to our properties as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. We employ a technical staff of engineers and geoscientists that perform technical analysis of each producing well and undeveloped location. The staff uses industry-accepted practices to estimate, with reasonable certainty, the economically producible oil and gas reserves. The practices for estimating hydrocarbons-in-place include, but are not limited to, mapping, seismic interpretation, core analysis, log analysis, mechanical properties of formations, thermal maturity, well testing and flowing bottom-hole pressure analysis. We employ an independent petroleum engineer to estimate 100% of our proved reserves. The data below is based on our reserve report prepared by W.D. Von Gonten & Co. The Standardized Measure and PV-10 amounts shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.

(1) | Our estimated net proved reserves and related Standardized Measure were determined using index prices for crude oil and natural gas, without giving effect to commodity derivative contracts, held constant throughout the life of our properties. The prices are based on the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered, determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the prices in effect on the first day of the month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, before they are adjusted, by lease, for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price realized at the wellhead. NGL pricing used was approximately 27% of corresponding crude oil prices.


(2) | One BOE is equal to six Mcf of natural gas or one Bbl of oil or NGLs based on an industry-standard approximate energy equivalency. This is a physical correlation and does not reflect a value or price relationship between the commodities.


(3) | Standardized Measure is calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 932, Extractive Activities — Oil and Gas.


(4) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash inflows and using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each of the preceding twelve months (or constantly flat using the base commodity prices given for the flat pricing case). PV-10 differs from the Standardized Measure because it does not include the effect of future income taxes. See below for a reconciliation of Standardized Measure to our PV-10.

The data in the table above represent estimates only. Oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil, NGLs and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Future prices realized for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The Standardized Measure amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate Standardized Measure, which is required by Financial Accounting Standards Board pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
PV-10
Certain of our oil and natural gas reserve disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented on a PV-10 basis. PV-10 is the estimated present value of the future cash flows, less future development and production costs from our proved reserves before income taxes, discounted using a 10% discount rate. PV-10 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it does not include the effects of future income taxes, as is required in computing the Standardized Measure. We believe that the presentation of a pre-tax PV-10 value provides relevant and useful information because it is widely used by investors and analysts as a basis for comparing the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other oil and gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company may impact the amount and timing of future income taxes, the use of a pre-tax PV-10 value provides greater comparability when evaluating oil and gas companies. The PV-10 value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of proved oil and gas reserves. The definition of PV-10 value, as defined above, may differ significantly from the definitions used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, the PV-10 value, as defined, may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Reconciliation of Proved Reserves
Our proved developed oil and natural gas reserves increased from 26.9 MMBOE at December 31, 2018, to 33.0 MMBOE at December 31, 2019, primarily due to the conversion of proved undeveloped to proved developed through our drilling program, which brought 17 gross wells online during 2019 and added 5.7 MMBOE of proved reserves. Our proved developed oil and natural gas reserves experienced positive revisions of 2.0 MMBOE primarily due to completed well performance exceeding previous third party estimates.

 | Proved Developed Reserves(MBOE)
As of December 31, 2018 | 26,912 | 
Extensions and discoveries | 4,517 | 
Conversion of proved undeveloped to proved developed | 5,742 | 
Sales of minerals in place | (562 | )
Revisions of prior estimates | 1,946 | 
Production | (5,543 | )
As of December 31, 2019 | 33,012 | 

Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At December 31, 2019, our proved undeveloped reserves were approximately 67.6 MMBOE, an increase of approximately 1.2 MMBOE from our December 31, 2018 estimated proved undeveloped reserves of approximately 66.5 MMBOE. In 2019, we added proved undeveloped reserves of 9.4 MMBOE as a result of drilling and completion activities, approximately 5.7 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves were converted to proved developed reserves as a result of drilling and completion activities during the year and 1.7 MMBOE of reserves were removed from our proved undeveloped reserves as a result of revisions in estimates from 2018. Revisions of previous estimates were removed primarily due the decrease in SEC pricing.
All PUD drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2024. The timing of our development schedule correlates with the projected increase in our production and the anticipated resulting free cash flow over the next five years.

Von Gonten & Co. has not performed other work for us or our affiliates that would affect its objectivity. The engineering information presented in W.D. Von Gonten & Co.’s reports was overseen by William D. Von Gonten, Jr., P.E. Mr. Von Gonten is an experienced reservoir engineer having been a practicing petroleum engineer since 1990. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University and is a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.
Technology Used To Establish Proved Reserves
Our independent reserve engineers follow SEC rules and definitions in preparing their reserve estimates. Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geological, geochemical and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, our independent reserve engineers employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our reserves include electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analysis, geologic maps and available down-hole and production data, seismic data and well-test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and undeveloped locations were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Our estimated reserves at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were prepared by W.D. Von Gonten & Co., independent reserve engineers. We expect to continue to have our reserve estimates prepared annually by our independent reserve engineers. Our internal professional staff works closely with W.D. Von Gonten & Co. to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve estimation process. All of the production, expense and well-ownership information, maintained in our reserve engineering database, is provided to our independent engineers. In addition, we provide such engineers other pertinent data, such as seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, well performance data, operating procedures, pricing differentials and relevant economic criteria, including lease operating statements. We make all requested information, as well as our pertinent personnel, available to our independent engineers in connection with their evaluation of our reserves. Year-end reserve estimates are reviewed by our Vice President-Reservoir Engineering, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Executive Officer and other senior management, and revisions are communicated to our board of directors.

As of December 31, 2019, we had leases across the Eagle Ford representing 1,233 net acres expiring in 2020, 575 net acres expiring in 2021 and 1,726 net acres expiring in 2022 and beyond. We anticipate that our current and future drilling plans, together with selected lease extensions, will address a significant portion of our leases expiring in the Eagle Ford in 2020.
Operations
General
We operate 84% of the Eagle Ford wells in which we have a working interest and intend to maintain a high degree of operational control over substantially all of our producing locations. As operator, we design and manage the development of a well and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. Independent contractors, engaged by us, provide all of the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work to improve production rates, increase reserves and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties.
Marketing and Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2019, purchases by our largest five customers accounted for 23%, 17%, 16%, 14% and 13% of our total revenues.
14

Since the oil and natural gas that we sell are commodities for which there are a large number of potential buyers, and because of the adequacy of the infrastructure to transport oil and natural gas in the areas in which we operate, if we were to lose one or more customers, we believe that we could readily procure substitute or additional customers such that our production volumes would not be materially affected for any significant period of time.
Transportation
During the initial development of our fields, we consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure options in the area of our production. Our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems. The oil is then transported by the purchaser by truck to a tank farm or by pipeline. Our natural gas is generally transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s pipeline interconnection point through our gathering system.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment for leasing and acquiring properties and in securing trained personnel. Our competitors include major and independent oil and natural gas companies that operate in our project areas. These competitors include, but are not limited to, Chesapeake Energy Corporation, EP Energy Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc., Marathon Oil Corporation, SilverBow Resources, Inc. Penn Virginia Corporation and Sundance Energy, Inc. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for productive crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects, as well as evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We are also affected by the competition for and the availability of equipment, including drilling rigs and completion equipment. We are unable to predict when, or if, shortages of such equipment may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation programs.
Seasonality of Business
Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months, resulting in seasonal fluctuations in the price we receive for our natural gas production. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation.
Title to Properties
Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas properties, we perform title reviews on significant leases, and depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain an additional title opinion or conduct a review to ensure all title is current relative to previously obtained title opinions. As a result, title examinations have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties. After an acquisition, we review the assignments from the seller for scrivener’s and other errors and execute and record corrective assignments as necessary.
We typically conduct title review of all acquired properties, regardless of whether they have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on any property, we update our title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects or customary assignments, if any. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property.
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects.
15

Oil and Natural Gas Leases
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any well drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties predominately range from 19.0% to 25.0% resulting in a net revenue interest to us ranging from 75.0% to 81.0%.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, crude oil and natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate properties for crude oil and natural gas production have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and that impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Furthermore, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, and new proposals that affect the crude oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and the courts. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and that our continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Nor are we currently aware of any specific pending legislation or regulation that is reasonably likely to be enacted, or for which we cannot predict the likelihood of enactment, and that is reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Oil
Our sales of oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EPAct”), and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport oil and refined products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”), be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with FERC. EPAct deemed certain interstate petroleum pipeline rates then in effect to be just and reasonable under the ICA, which are commonly referred to as “grandfathered rates.” Pursuant to EPAct, FERC also adopted a generally applicable rate-making methodology, which, as currently in effect, allows petroleum pipelines to change their rates provided they do not exceed prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (“PPI”), plus 1.3%. For the five-year period beginning July 1, 2016, the index is PPI plus 1.23%.
FERC has also established cost-of-service rates, market-based rates and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach. A pipeline may file rates based on its cost of service if there is a substantial divergence between its actual costs of providing service and the rate resulting from application of the index. A pipeline may charge market-based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. Further, a pipeline may establish rates through settlement with all current non-affiliated shippers.
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates vary from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors that are similarly situated.
16

Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
Regulation of Transportation and Sales of Natural Gas
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could re-enact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the NGPA and culminated in the adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.
FERC regulates interstate natural gas, transportation rates and terms and conditions of service, which affect the marketing of natural gas that we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Beginning in 1992, FERC issued a series of orders, beginning with Order No. 636, to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines’ traditional role of providing the sale and transportation of natural gas as a single service has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others that buy and sell natural gas. Although FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.
In 2000, FERC issued Order No. 637 and subsequent orders, which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets. Among other things, Order No. 637 revised FERC’s pricing policy by waiving price ceilings for short-term released capacity for a two-year experimental period and effected changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, penalties, rights of first refusal and information reporting.
Gathering services, which occur upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, FERC’s determination as to the classification of facilities is done on a case-by-case basis. To the extent that FERC issues an order that reclassifies transmission facilities as gathering facilities, our costs of getting gas to point of sale locations may increase. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, non-discriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
Intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services vary from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
17

Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our exploration, development, production and processing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things: require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production; restrict the way we handle or dispose of our wastes; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, wilderness areas, or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.
These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. In addition, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly emissions control, waste handling, disposal, clean-up and remediation requirements for the crude oil and gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretations of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position in the future. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. We maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such risks. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that current requirements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, there is no assurance that this will continue in the future.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. CERCLA exempts “petroleum, including oil or any fraction thereof” from the definition of “hazardous substance” unless specifically listed or designated under CERCLA. While the EPA interprets CERCLA to exclude oil and fractions of oil, hazardous substances that are added to petroleum or that increase in concentration as a result of contamination of the petroleum during use are not considered part of the petroleum and are regulated under CERCLA as a hazardous substance.
Potentially responsible parties under CERCLA include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “potentially responsible parties” may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
18

We also generate solid and hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. The RCRA imposes requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. In the course of our operations we generate petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. The RCRA regulations specifically exclude from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil, natural gas or geothermal energy. Following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA was required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. After undertaking its review, the EPA signed a determination in 2019 concluding that it does not need to regulate oil and gas exploration and production wastes, and specifically "drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil, gas or geothermal energy," because the states are adequately regulating such wastes under the Subtitle D provisions of the RCRA. However, a loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes in the future could result in an increase in our costs and drilling operations to manage and dispose of generated wastes and a corresponding decrease in their drilling operations, which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, legislation has been proposed in Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and cleanup requirements. No such effort has been successful to date.
We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce crude oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators) and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. Pursuant to the CWA and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants into regulated waters must be performed in accordance with the terms of the permits issued by the EPA or analogous state agencies. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Currently, storm water discharges from crude oil and natural gas exploration, production, processing or treatment operations, or transmission facilities are exempt from regulation under the CWA.
In May 2015, the EPA issued final rules attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. In November 2017, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers issued a notice to rescind the Clean Water Rule and re-codify the regulatory text that existed prior to 2015 defining “water of the United States.” The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers formally repealed the rule in September 2019. In January 2020, the Trump administration published a final replacement rule, called the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, that purports to expressly define which categories or water may be federally regulated under the CWA. The Navigable Waters Protection Rule is set to take effect 60 days from publication of the replacement rule in the Federal Register. Legal challenges to the Navigable Waters Protection Rule are expected. As such, uncertainty remains with respect to the future implementation of the rule. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as other enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
19

Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and natural gas operations, and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and comply with stringent air permit requirements, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. For example, the EPA also issued CAA regulations relevant to hydraulic fracturing in 2012, including a new source performance standard for volatile organic chemicals (“VOCs”) and sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) emissions with expanded applicability to natural gas operations, as well as a new air toxics standard. These rules create significant new technology requirements for controlling wellhead emissions from our operations. The EPA has made several changes to these rules in response to industry and environmental group legal challenges and administrative petitions, including, most recently, a decision to include a specific performance standard for methane in the rules (discussed further below). In general, there is increasing interest in and focus on regulation of methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations, and hydraulic fracturing operations in particular, under the CAA.
In June 2016, the EPA published final rules establishing new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The EPA’s final rules include the NSPS at Subpart OOOOa to limit methane emissions from equipment and processes across the oil and natural gas source category. The rules also extend limitations on VOC emissions to sources that were unregulated under the previous NSPS at Subpart OOOO. Affected methane and VOC sources include hydraulically fractured (or re-fractured) oil and natural gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and pneumatic pumps. Several states and industry groups have filed suit before the D.C. Circuit challenging EPA’s implementation of the methane rule and legal authority to issue the methane rules. In September 2018, the EPA proposed further amendments that would reduce the 2016 Subpart OOOOa standards’ fugitive emissions monitoring requirements and expand exceptions to controlling methane emissions from pneumatic pumps, among other changes. Various industry and environmental groups have separately challenged both the original 2016 Subpart OOOOa standards and the EPA’s attempts to delay the implementation of the rule. In May 2016, the EPA also announced its intention to impose methane emission standards for existing sources, and in February 2018, new standards for methane emission from oil and gas wells were proposed by the Trump Administration. In August 2019, the EPA proposed two options for rescinding the Subpart OOOOa standards. Under the EPA’s preferred alternative, the agency would rescind the methane limits for new, reconstructed and modified oil and natural gas production sources while leaving in place the general emission limits for VOCs, and relieve the EPA of its obligation to develop guidelines for methane emissions from existing sources. In addition, the proposal would remove from the oil and natural gas category the natural gas transmission and storage segment. The other proposed alternative would rescind the methane requirements of the NSPS applicable to all oil and natural gas sources, without removing any sources from that source
category (and still requiring control of VOCs in general). The EPA also finalized separate rules under the CAA in June 2016 regarding criteria for aggregating multiple sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities (such as tank batteries and compressor stations), on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require us to install costly pollution control equipment. In addition, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the NAAQS for ground-level ozone from the current standard of 75 ppb for the current 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 ppb for both standards. The final rule became effective on December 28, 2015 and was challenged in courts. The D.C. Circuit struck down parts of the rule in February 2018. In April 2018 and July 2018, the EPA issued area designations for all areas not addressed in the previous rule. States with moderate or high nonattainment areas must submit state implementation plans to EPA by October 2021. States are expected to implement more stringent permitting and pollution control requirements as a result of the final rule, which could apply to our operations.
We cannot predict future regulatory requirements in this area or the cost to comply with such requirements. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. We further note that states are authorized to regulate methane emissions within their boundaries provided their requirements are not weaker than federal rules.

Regulation of GHG Emissions
Climate and related energy policy, laws and regulations could change quickly, and substantial uncertainty exists about the nature of many potential developments that could impact the sources and uses of energy. In December 2015, the United States and 194 other countries, adopted the Paris Agreement, committing to work towards limiting global warming and agreeing to a monitoring and review process of GHG emissions. This will heighten political pressure on the United States to ensure continued compliance with enforcement measures resulting from the Clean Air Act and to bring forward further actions to reduce GHGs in the period post 2030. On October 4, 2016, the E.U. ratified the Paris Agreement, thus meeting the threshold for the agreement to come into force. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States planned to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. President Trump formally initiated the withdrawal process in November 2019, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
The EPA requires the reporting of GHGs from specified large GHG emission sources, including GHGs from petroleum and natural gas systems that emit more than 25,000 tons of GHGs per year. Reporting is required from onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas processing, transmission and distribution, underground natural gas storage and liquefied natural gas import, export and storage. While new legislation requiring GHG controls is not expected at the national level in the near term, almost one-half of the states have taken actions to monitor and/or reduce emissions of GHGs, including obligations on utilities to purchase renewable energy and GHG cap and trade programs. Although most of the state level initiatives have to date focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as coal-fired electric plants, it is possible that smaller sources of emissions could become subject to GHG emission limitations or allowance purchase requirements in the future.
Any one of these climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher GHG emitting energy sources, such as coal, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. To the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG emitting energy sources, such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations.
Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas we produce or otherwise cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable state statutes may restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during crude oil and natural gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids (including disposal wells) is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, include the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority. We utilize hydraulic fracturing in our operations as a means of maximizing the productivity of our wells and operate saltwater disposal wells to dispose of produced water. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) provisions of the SDWA to expressly exclude hydraulic fracturing without diesel additives from the definition of “underground injection.” However, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have considered several bills in recent years to end this exemption, as well as other exemptions for crude oil and gas activities under U.S. environmental laws.
21

Federal agencies have also begun to directly regulate hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over, and issued permitting guidance for, hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the SDWA’s UIC Program. As a result, service providers or companies that use diesel products in the hydraulic fracturing process are expected to be subject to additional permitting requirements or enforcement actions under the SDWA. The EPA has also issued CAA regulations relevant to hydraulic fracturing in 2012, including the NSPS for VOC and SO2 emissions with expanded applicability to natural gas operations and new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants standards for air toxics (although the Trump Administration has indicated an intent to review this rule). Also, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. These regulatory developments are indicative of increasing federal regulatory activity related to hydraulic fracturing, which has the potential to create additional permitting, technology, recordkeeping and site study requirements, among others, for our business. In addition, federal agencies have started to assert regulatory authority over the process. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) had developed comprehensive regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal land in 2015 subject to extensive litigation challenges and in December 2017, the BLM filed notice that it was withdrawing the rules. The State of California and environmental groups filed a lawsuit against BLM seeking to enforce the rules and such litigation is ongoing.
State governments in the areas where we operate have adopted or are considering adopting additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing that could restrict its use in certain circumstances or make it more costly to utilize. Such measures may address any risk to drinking water, the potential for hydrocarbon migration and disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing. A majority of states around the country, including Texas, have also adopted some form of fracturing fluid disclosure law to compel disclosure of fracturing fluid ingredients and additives that are not subject to trade secret protection. Other states, such as Ohio and Texas, have begun to study potential seismic risks related to underground injection of fracturing fluids. For example, on October 28, 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission, or TRC, published a new rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the saltwater or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well.
Any enforcement actions or requirements of additional studies or investigations by governmental authorities where we operate could increase our operating costs and cause delays or interruptions of our operations.
At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these state and local actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing.
ESA and Migratory Birds
The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”), restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by no later than completion of the Agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not meet that deadline, but continues to consider the listing of additional species under the ESA. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. While some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or habitats in areas where our operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our leases.

National Environmental Policy Act
Our operations on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. Under NEPA, federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior must evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. This review can entail a detailed evaluation including an Environmental Impact Statement. This process can result in significant delays and may result in additional limitations and costs associated with projects on federal lands.
OSHA
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (the “OSH Act”), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSH Act’s hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used, produced or released in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. In March 2016, OSHA amended its legal requirements, publishing a final rule that established a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica and provided other provisions to protect employees, such as requirements for exposure assessment, methods for controlling exposure, respiratory protection, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping. This final rule became effective in June 2016. However, several industry groups have filed suit in the D.C. Circuit to halt implementation of the rule. Increasing concerns about worker safety at drill sites may lead to increased regulation and enforcement or related tort claims by our employees. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Related Permits and Authorizations
Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state, federal and/or Tribal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation or other oil and natural gas activities, and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for on-going operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can in certain cases delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines and other operations.
We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements; however, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other nonrecurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2019, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2020.
Related Insurance
We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our development activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. Further, we have no coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 84 employees, including 14 engineers and geoscientists, 14 land professionals and 32 field operating personnel. None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
We also contract for the services of independent consultants involved in land, engineering, regulatory, accounting, financial and other disciplines as needed.
