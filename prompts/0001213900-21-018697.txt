 Item 1. Business.
 
Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on July 10, 2020, as a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). While we may pursue an initial Business Combination target in any industry, sector or geographic region, we intend to capitalize on our management team’s background and experience to identify promising opportunities in the life sciences sector. Our sponsor is CM Life Sciences Holdings, LLC a Delaware limited liability company (our “Sponsor”).
 
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
Registration statements for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) became effective on September 1, 2020. On September 4, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 44,275,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”) included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”), including 5,775,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments (the “Over-Allotment Units”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $442.75 million.
 
Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 7,236,667 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately $10.86 million.
 
Prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, on July 16, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share, to cover certain offering costs of the Company in consideration for 10,062,500 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of Class B common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B Common Stock”). In August 2020, our Sponsor transferred 25,000 Founder Shares to each of Mr. Islam, Dr. Leproust and Mr. Turner. On September 1, 2020, we effected a 1:1.1 stock split of our Class B Common Stock, resulting in our Sponsor holding an aggregate of 10,993,750 Founder Shares and there being an aggregate of 11,068,750 Founder Shares outstanding.
 
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $442.75 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and invested in United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an initial Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.

We entered into separate forward purchase agreements with affiliates of our Sponsor, Casdin Capital, LLC (“Casdin Capital”) and Corvex Management LP (“Corvex Management”), in their capacities as investment advisors on behalf of one or more investment funds, clients or accounts managed by each of Casdin Capital and Corvex Management, respectively (collectively, their “Clients”), pursuant to which, subject to the conditions described below, they will cause certain Clients to purchase from us up to an aggregate amount of 15,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Forward Purchase Shares”) for $10.00 per Forward Purchase Share, or an aggregate amount of up to $150,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our initial Business Combination. The respective obligations of Casdin Capital and Corvex Management to cause Clients to purchase Forward Purchase Shares will, among other things, be conditioned on our completing an initial Business Combination with a company engaged in a business that is within the investment objectives of the Clients purchasing Forward Purchase Shares and on the Business Combination (including the target assets or business, and the terms of the Business Combination) being reasonably acceptable to such Clients as determined by Casdin Capital or Corvex Management, as relevant, as investment advisors on behalf of such Clients.
 
Our Class A Common Stock and warrants trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “CMLF” and “CMLFW,” respectively. Those Units not separated continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “CMLFU.”
 
Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating our initial Business Combination. Our initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in Trust) at the time we sign a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, we will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
 
We intend to effectuate a Business Combination using the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, and from additional issuances of, if any, our capital stock and our debt, or a combination of cash, stock and debt. We have not engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we complete a Business Combination, and we have not generated any operating revenue to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. Our entire activity since inception through December 31, 2020 related to our formation, the preparation for the Initial Public Offering, and following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act, because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
We will provide the holders of our Public Shares (the “Public Stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account. The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we pay to the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering.
 
If we are unable to complete a Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Pending Sema4 Business Combination
 
On February 10, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Mount Sinai Genomics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, d/b/a Sema4 (“Sema4”), and S-IV Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our direct wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to the conditions thereof, we will acquire Sema4 through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Sema4, with Sema4 surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”) and, in connection with the Merger, our name will be changed to a name to be determined by Sema4 (and reasonably acceptable to us) (together with the other agreements and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Sema4 Business Combination”). Holders of Sema4 Capital Stock will receive common stock of CM Life Sciences and, at their election, up to $343 million in cash in exchange for shares of Sema4. The consummation of the proposed Sema4 Business Combination is subject to certain conditions as further described in the Merger Agreement.
 
On February 10, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (collectively, the “PIPE Investors” which include certain existing equityholders of Sema4), pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors have collectively subscribed for 35,000,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $350,000,000 (the “PIPE Investment”). The PIPE Investment will be consummated immediately prior to the closing of the Sema4 Business Combination. The Subscription Agreements provide for certain customary registration rights for the PIPE Investors. The Subscription Agreements will terminate with no further force and effect upon the earliest to occur of: (a) such date and time as the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties to such Subscription Agreement; and (c) November 9, 2021.
 
For more information about the Merger Agreement and the proposed Sema4 Business Combination, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Sema4 Business Combination Announcement,” as well as our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 11, 2021 and the Sema4 Disclosure Statement that we will file with the SEC. Unless specifically stated, this Annual Report does not give effect to the proposed Sema4 Business Combination and does not contain the risks associated with the proposed Sema4 Business Combination. Such risks and effects relating to the proposed Sema4 Business Combination will be included in the Sema4 Disclosure Statement.
 
Strategy
 
Our team intends to leverage the strong life sciences knowledge base and public and private market experience of our Sponsor in completing our initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor is an affiliate of Eli Casdin, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Casdin Capital, and of Keith Meister, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Corvex Management, two leading investment firms.
 
Over the years, members of our management team from Casdin Capital have developed a rich, reflective and repeatable scientific process as rigorous as any found in relevant research labs, which we intend to draw upon as we evaluate targets. Our strategy is to seek out every possible data point and test every possible hypothesis. By methodically breaking down core elements, from treatments to management teams to political-historical context, and examining them from all angles, testing theories as we go, our leadership team learns and grows in step with the life sciences industry itself. When we assess company targets and the mechanisms for solving them, whether a drug or a technology application, we will seek to understand their innovative methodologies, not just their market potential. Beyond the science, we will also scrutinize target markets and competitors, question CEOs, Executive Teams and Boards on their ability to measure outcomes and push toward solutions, and create models for everything from commercial launch capabilities to regulatory hurdles to an entire team’s industry expertise and history. Deep knowledge of the science and its applications is only the beginning. Our experience continually reminds us to focus on leadership’s ability to grow a business and create an empowered workforce, and we seek companies that create the drive and resilience necessary to reach ambitious goals and, ultimately, market success.
 
Casdin Capital has developed relationships going back to the unlocking of the human genome, and today is a familiar and trusted participant in this dynamic and complex industry, as well-versed in the science as in the business models that underpin it. As an affiliate of Casdin Capital with key management members from Casdin Capital, we intend to leverage its reputation and position as more than just an investor, but a key partner to major and emerging companies, to work with the most successful and innovative industry professionals, the ones who will continue to drive growth and profits over the next few decades. Combined with Corvex Management, our leadership team is diverse and deep, with strengths in science and business, in research and investing, capital markets and corporate board rooms, and as alert to industry realignments as they are to subtle market moves. Success and strong returns come as much from our collective dedication as it does from our area-expertise. Our seasoned management team and board intends to leverage information from industry experts, scientists, management teams, and corporate directors to proceed with discipline and rigor to complete an attractive business combination that will produce attractive returns for our shareholders.

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our acquisition strategy, we have identified the following criteria to evaluate prospective target businesses. We intend to seek to acquire companies in the Life Sciences Tools, Synthetic Biology and Diagnostics fields and that we believe:

● | have a potential scientific or other business advantage or opportunity in the markets in which they operate; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have strong and experienced management teams or key personnel; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that we believe does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

Sourcing of Potential Initial Business Combination Targets
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or completing the Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial Business Combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm stating that such an initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a target will not be deemed an affiliate solely by virtue of ownership by our Sponsor or its affiliates, or any of their or our executive officers or directors, of less than 10% of its common stock, individually or in the aggregate.
 
Members of our management team and our independent directors will directly or indirectly own Founder Shares and/or Private Placement Warrants following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such Business Combination opportunity to such other entity. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial Business Combination.
 
In addition, our Sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial Business Combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial Business Combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial Business Combination.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A Common Stock upon the completion of our initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination.
 
Class A Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial Business Combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial Business Combination, and all shares of Class A Common Stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of the Initial Public Offering, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements.
 
5

 

Limitations on Redemptions
 
Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial Business Combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial Business Combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial Business Combination, and all shares of Class A Common Stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of the Initial Public Offering, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements.
 
Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we will:
 

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on Public Stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If Public Stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial Business Combination.
 
Submission of our initial Business Combination to a stockholder vote
 
If we provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will:
 

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any Founder Shares they hold and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their respective affiliates may purchase Public Shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their respective affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such purchases or other transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such purchases or other transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. In the event that our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their respective affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from Public Stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining the requisite stockholder approval of the Business Combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval
 
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with a Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
 
However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial Business Combination.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
 
Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination within such 24-month period from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or during any extended period of time that we may have to consummate an initial business combination as a result of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (an “Extension Period”), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination within the 24-month time period or during any Extension Period.
Competition
 
We may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for Business Combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing Business Combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, if the proposed Sema4 Business Combination is not consummated, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our Public Stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination, and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a Business Combination. If we have not completed our initial Business Combination within the required time period, our Public Stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.
Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers: Eli Casdin, Brian Emes and Shaun Rodriguez. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on the status of the proposed Sema4 Business Combination and, if the proposed Sema4 Business Combination is not consummated, whether a different target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the current stage of the Business Combination process. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination.
