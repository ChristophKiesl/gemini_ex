Item 1. Business

Our primary line of business, conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Humbly Hemp, Inc., offers a line of energy / snack bars featuring all-natural hemp and other healthy ingredients. We will provide high quality and affordable hemp products (focusing on snacks) that are packed with protein, omegas, and free of all major allergens. Our initial product line will feature healthy snacks, highlighting hemps nutritional benefits, and tapping into the nutritious snacking boom. We are currently creating a 3 flavor line of energy/snack bars. We are also developing a line of “Hemp Hunks” hemp seed bar coated with high quality dark chocolate, and another coated in yogurt. We will then move into; artisan hemp milks, protein drinks and powders, body care, flavored hemp seeds, hemp granola/cereal, hemp milks, etc.
 
In our business model, we will source quality ingredients, and reach out to private label manufactures that already possess the infrastructure to make these products, and to provide them at an affordable price, through a seamless online marketplace, and through regular distribution channels like Whole Foods, Sprouts, etc. We are already working on a partnership in with Statewide Distribution, in Los Angeles to get our products in up to 3,000 stores throughout southern California. 
 
Through constant education and promotion, we plan make hemp a part of everyone’s lives. Our unique branding will appeal to every demographic and our commitment to hemp education will grow our market, creating an even bigger category in the U.S. Our goal is to highlight hemp’s versatility through a wide range of nutritional products. 
 
Product Line 
 
Our initial product line will consist of a set of three nutrition bars. We believe this type of product is a perfect start for Humbly Hemp. It will highlight all of the nutritional benefits of hemp, and from the market research we have done, nutrition bars are in huge demand right now.

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a group of endogenous cannabinoid receptors located in the mammalian brain and throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, consisting of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors.
 
The name ENDO Water is in process of being trademarked. On June 27, 2017, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Endo Water, Inc., to conduct our planned operations in this product sector. 
 
On May 31, 2017, we entered into a venture for the development of a commercial bottled water operation near Browning, Montana. The new venture will be operated through Spring Hill Water Company, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Spring Hill”). Spring Hill is 49% owned by our subsidiary corporation, Humble Water Company, and 51% owned by Doore, LLC. Doore, LLC, which will serve as the Manager of Spring Hill, has contributed the land and water source to be used in the new operation through a Land & Water Lease Agreement under which Spring Hill will have the use of 2 acres of land and no less than 5 acre-feet of water for an initial term of 25 years and at a lease rate of $1 per year. Through Humble Water Company, our initial capital contribution to Spring Hill will be $100,000 to be used in commencing operations. In addition, we have committed to provide additional capital to be used for a bottling facility and equipment, in an amount up to $530,000, within the next 3 years. Should we fail to provide this additional capital within the next 3 years, our ownership percentage in Spring Hill will be reduced from 49% to 20%. Although we hold a minority ownership percentage in Spring Hill, we will have voting control over the company with 75% of the voting membership units. Further, 100% of the losses, expenditures, and deductions from Spring Hill will be allocated to our subsidiary, Humble Water Company.

Health and wellness is becoming a part of everyone’s lives, and eating right is usually the first step. What we can do to test the market for a product like this, is to take a look at the types of consumer that would be looking for our solution. The number of diets trends in America continues to grow, and hemp is the perfect solution for many of them.

Global Industries Analyst Report (GIA), states that the global market for foods developed for individuals with allergies or intolerances is expected to grow to 24.8 billion by 2020. Food allergies and intolerances are a growing public health problem causing higher demand of products that meet special dietary requirements. The biggest concerns:
 


· | Wheat - immune response to one or more proteins found in wheat, does not have to be gluten 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Lactose - Approximately 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is most prevalent in people of East Asian descent, affecting more than 90 percent of adults in some of these communities.
· | Dairy - Individuals with a dairy allergy are allergic to either one or both of the milk proteins, casein and whey. Milk allergies are more common in children and some people grow out of them. 
· | Gluten - Only 1% of Americans has celiac disease, but 1/3 of the population claim to be gluten sensitive, and is trying to live a gluten free lifestyle. 
· | Soy - an exact percentage of Americans dealing with a soy allergy is unknown, but it is one of the “Big 8” food allergies 
· | Nut Allergy - Hemp is a wonderful substitute for those with nut allergies 

 
Hemp is not only attractive to those with food allergens; individuals who follow a strict diet for any reason will be extremely attracted to hemp. Some of the more popular lifestyle diets include: 
 


· | Paleo - based on Google trends, book sales, and website hits, the number of Americans following a paleo lifestyle is in the millions 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Vegetarianism - ”Vegetarianism in America” study, published by Vegetarian Times (vegetariantimes.com), shows that 3.2 percent of U.S. adults, or 7.3 million people, follow a vegetarian-based diet
· | Veganism - the Vegetarian Times study shows that 0.5 percent or 1 million people, follow an animal free vegan diet 
· | No GMO - 80% of the food consumed by children in America today are genetically modified. The NO GMO tag is the fastest growing segment in health food 
· | Kosher - it is estimated that 21% of the 5.3 million Jewish Americans keep kosher. 

 
Hemp based foods can be consumed by anyone in these segments. In 2014, the Hemp Industries Association (HIA), a non-profit trade association, released final estimates of the size of the U.S. retail market for hemp products. The estimated total retail value of hemp products sold in the U.S. in 2014 was at least $620 million. More importantly, the total retail sales of hemp food and body care products in the United States is estimated at $200 million.
 
Everyone can consume our hemp-based foods, but it is never smart to market a product that way. In order to pinpoint our ideal consumer, we have used research done by IRI and SPINS. In this study they broke down this new category of health CPG consumers into several segments. Those categories called “True Believers”, and “Enlightened Environmentalists” are the two main shopper segments for organic food. They make up 46% of organic food purchases. They each make up 9% of the shoppers, so 18% together.
 
True Believers: Their main concern is to keep a healthy body. They buy only organic, they try new things, are college educated, and have a median income of $65,000.
Enlightened Environmentalists: They care about the environment and buy products and live in a way that doesn’t hurt the environment. They specifically shop at places that carry mostly organic and environmentally friendly products; most of them have graduate school degrees and average 57 years of age. They have a median income of $57,000.
 
By taking these two groups we can highlight some main characteristics of our target consumer:
 


· | Average Age: 35-57 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Education: College& Graduate School 
· | Income: $55,000-$70,000 
· | Where they shop: a mixture of online & Organic and Health based retail (Whole Foods)

Competition
 
In the market we are going to occupy, we face four major competitors:
 


· | Manitoba Hemp Foods: Based in Canada, Manitoba looks to be the industry leader in this market. They have been selling hemp products since 1998 and have created a strong brand. They carry Hemp Hearts, Hemp Heart Bars, Hemp protein smoothies, Hemp protein powder, and Hemp oil. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Evo Hemp: Evo is a boulder based Hemp bar company. They are one of the newer hemp brands in the market. They only offer bars in their product line. 
· | Nutiva: Nutiva is an organic superfood brand. They offer a wide range of products with, chia, red palm, coconut, and hemp. All of their products are non GMO, and USDA organic. 
· | Naturally Splendid: Naturally Splendid is a multifaceted biotechnology company developing, commercializing, producing, selling, and licensing an entirely new generation of hemp-derived, high quality, nutrient-dense Omega foods, nutritional food enhancers, and related products.

Our Potential Advantages
 
Our new brand offers a new take on hemp products. While these are very successful brands, they do not stray away from the same old health food positioning. Humbly Hemp will be approachable by every demographic. We will bring hemp into the daily routine of the “everyman”. Our branding and market position will be far more exciting than any other competitor. Humbly Hemp will be a “Lifestyle” brand. By aligning ourselves with hemp producers and manufactures we will be able to focus more on marketing and promotion side of the business. We will not have to worry about the overhead of a manufacturing facility. Our online store will allow us to reach every household in America at a competitive price, and our private label approach will give us the ability to offer a wide range of product lines. Our connections within the hemp, and CPG industry will create the opportunity for co-branding. We will be an early mover in this category.
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution Strategies
 
Marketing Plan
 
Growth Hacking: In the startup phase, we will utilize growth hacking to launch our brand. We will promote through all social media channels to build brand awareness for our initial products. The first of these attempts will be sending products to popular Bloggers, Vlogers, and social media celebrities, for promotion on their channels. These techniques cost very little, and are extremely effective for Internet businesses. We will also use Google Ad words to push the product through online advertisements and SEO. 
Online Marketing: We will tailor an online marketing campaign to attract the two market segments mentioned earlier in the target market segment. This position will assure that we are promoting to the most viable group of consumers.
Instagram: We will take a strategy similar to that of Herschel Supply Co. on Instagram. They have been doing the same Instagram campaign since day one. #Welltraveled is the theme of their profile. They feature beautiful travel pictures from all over the world. This fits with the bag companies theme of beautiful modern travel bags and accessories. Our campaign will revolver around #LiveHumbly our trademark slogan. We will only show beautifully edits photography shots of an outstretched hand holding different flavors of our bars, in different cool spots, (Beaches, Gyms, Coffee Shops, Offices). This will follow up that our brand is meant to be enjoyed anywhere anytime. We will post one picture every day, year round. 
Twitter: The Key to twitter is communication. This will be the key to success on this social channel. The best twitter accounts today are ones that do not broadcast to the consumer, but engage the consumer with interesting content in the form of: 

- | Questions/Surveys 
--+--------------------
- | Brand related news 
- | Customer Service 
- | Company News 
- | Follower Engagement

Facebook: Facebook has gone from being a publishing channel for brands, to now a landing page of brand identity. We will utilize Facebook as a cornerstone of our online identity. We will be careful about being “too promotional” and we will be aiming for content that people will share. To achieve this we will: 

- | Plan Monthly Campaigns 
--+------------------------------------------------------
- | Find Creative way to use consumer generated content 
- | Invest In short catchy video content clips (Mini Ads)
- | Utilize Facebook Ads for major campaigns 

Social Contests: We will have Quarterly Social Media Channel contests that span from our website to every single channel we have. These will range from, Photo contest, video contests, cooking contests, etc. These types of contests really boosts followership, sharing and all drive traffic directly back to the landing page. They are relatively cheap and the prizes we will give away consist of actual product, lifestyle related products, and company marketing materials. 
Analysis and Execution: We will use Hootsuite to posts, and also analyze all of the social media channels. They are the industry leaders in the field, and it is an application that we have previous knowledge in. 
Guerrilla Marketing: Once we have scaled, and doing business with the big box retailers, we will use more traditional marketing techniques including; in store promotions, trade shows, festival, and Brand Ambassador Programs. We will begin this during the second Quarter of our initial year by hiring two college students located in Los Angeles. They will assist in Social Media Content Creation, Event Marketing, and In Store Promotions in the Los Angeles area. We will quickly expand this program and have 2 students in each state we launch into. This will allow us to get our key demographic engaged in the products on campus, creating lifelong fans of Humbly Hemp. 
Consumer Outreach & Education: The most important factor in the marketing of our products will be consumer education on the benefits of hemp. We will use a page in our website to promote this, and in our growth we will focus on this more and more. In the future we will work on doing some co-branding with Hemp associations, Non Profit Groups that share our goals in keeping people and our planet healthy. 
Sales Plan
 
Retail Distribution: Our partnership with Statewide distribution will give us a leg up on the competition out of the gate. The ability to get our products into so many stores in Southern California is a huge win for Humbly Hemp. We will focus on Southern California and scale our growth from there.
Online Sales: Our website will be extremely easy to use, and the process of making a purchase will be seamless. We are working with the best website designers to ensure that our marketplace is both beautiful and functional.
B2B Online Sales: The number of online health food stores and especially health food subscription boxes is growing every day. They are always looking for quality products to stock their stores and monthly boxes. We will be targeting them to feature all Humbly Hemp products.

Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We are party to a Consulting Agreement with Protein Squared, LLC dba Bar One (“Bar One”). Under the agreement, Bar One has been contracted to develop our Humbly Hemp Snack Bar and to handle fulfillment of our product orders through a third party manufacturer. Under the agreement, we will compensate Bar One for these services by paying a $0.03 commission to Bar One for each product unit produced for us.
