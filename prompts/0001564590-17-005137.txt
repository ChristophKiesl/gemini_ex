ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a biotechnology company committed to developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism to treat rare genetic diseases and cancer. Our engineered human enzymes are designed to degrade specific amino acids in the blood to target these diseases. In inborn errors of metabolism, or IEM, a subset of rare genetic diseases, we are seeking to reduce the toxic levels of amino acids in patients to the normal range. In oncology, we are seeking to reduce amino acid blood levels below the normal range where we believe we will be able to exploit the dependence of certain cancers on specific amino acids.
 Our lead product candidate, AEB1102 (pegzilarginase), is engineered to degrade the amino acid arginine and is being developed to treat two extremes of arginine metabolism, including arginine excess in patients with Arginase I deficiency, an IEM, as well as some cancers which have been shown to have a metabolic dependence on arginine. AEB1102 has demonstrated clinical proof of mechanism in both scenarios. In a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Arginase I deficiency, a dose-proportional reduction in plasma arginine levels was observed in two patients. A reduction in blood arginine levels was also observed in Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors and the hematological malignancies relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. These preliminary results support its potential use as a therapeutic of both Arginase I deficiency and certain cancers associated with abnormal amino acid metabolism. 
 We are conducting three clinical trials for AEB1102, consisting of one Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of Arginase I deficiency and two Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of certain cancers. 
  
• | Arginase I Deficiency. Following completion of dosing for the first two adult patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Arginase I deficiency, we submitted a protocol amendment in November 2016 to broaden the scope of our Phase 1 trial into a Phase 1/2 trial. The amended protocol includes dosing of pediatric patients (two and older) and weekly repeat dosing, with the intent to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical response of AEB1102 in patients with this IEM. In the first quarter of 2017, we received IRB approval for the Phase 1/2 protocol for the treatment of patients with Arginase I deficiency at multiple clinical trial sites. In March 2017, we received an information request from the FDA which included comments and recommendations on the protocol amendment and a request for supporting documents based on their review of our completed toxicology studies, our dose escalation plan and our information to support the inclusion of pediatric patients. As recommended by the FDA, we replied with supporting information and requested a follow-up meeting. At this time, we believe our Phase 1/2 protocol provides an appropriate path to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AEB1102 in pediatric patients, and pending FDA feedback, we plan to initiate dosing in pediatric patients in the middle of 2017. In March 2017, we announced results from the first two adult patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of Arginase I deficiency at the 2017 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting, or ACMG Annual Meeting. We intend to continue enrollment of adult patients and plan to dose additional adult patients in the middle of 2017. Topline data from this trial is expected in the first half of 2018..

• | Advanced Solid Tumors. In October 2015, we initiated enrollment for a Phase 1 dose escalation trial for cancer patients with advanced solid tumors. In this ongoing trial, patients have demonstrated a reduction in blood arginine levels from the dosing of AEB1102, providing proof-of-mechanism. We expect to announce results of this Phase 1 dose escalation in patients with advanced solid tumors and anticipate initiating expansion arms in specific solid tumor types, potentially in combination with existing or emerging standards of care, in the fourth quarter of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hematological Malignancies. In July 2016, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with the hematological malignancies AML and MDS in the United States and Canada. As demonstrated in the trial for patients with advanced solid tumors, the first three cohorts of this trial have demonstrated proof-of-mechanism. We expect to announce results of the Phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with AML and MDS in the fourth quarter of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our pipeline of engineered human enzyme product candidates in preclinical development includes: AEB3103, an enzyme that degrades the amino acid cysteine, and its oxidized form cystine, to target a widely recognized, but previously 
 4

underexploited vulnerability of cancer to oxidative stress; AEB2109, an enzyme that degrades the amino acid methionine to target methionine-dependent cancers and AEB4104, an engineered human enzyme to treat another IEM by degrading the amino acid homocysteine. We plan to continue preclinical development of AEB3103, AEB2109, AEB4104 and related variants of these candidates with the aim of submitting an IND for one or more of these development candidates in 2018. 
 We are a patient-focused organization conscious of the fact that IEM and oncology patients have limited treatment options, and we recognize that their lives and well-being are highly dependent upon our efforts and the efforts of others to develop improved therapies. For this reason, we are passionate about discovering and developing therapeutics to address IEM and oncology indications where there is a significant unmet medical need. Our goal is to create a world-class company committed to efficiently developing a portfolio of product candidates to treat these diseases.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to build a fully integrated biotechnology company dedicated to the development and commercialization of engineered human enzymes targeting abnormal metabolism to transform the lives of patients. To execute our strategy, we intend to:

• | Successfully advance our lead product candidate, AEB1102, through clinical development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For Arginase I deficiency, we have received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and Fast Track Designation from the FDA. We initiated a Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial in the United States to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical response of AEB1102. If the results from the trial are supportive, we anticipate initiating a Phase 3 registration directed trial in the United States in 2018. For our oncology indications, we are conducting Phase 1 trials in patients with advanced solid tumors and in patients with the hematological malignancies AML and MDS. We plan to initiate single agent expansion arms in patients with selected solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Additionally, we plan to initiate a Phase 1b/2 trial, potentially in combination with existing or emerging standards of care in one or more solid tumor types and hematological malignancies. If we see compelling evidence of anti-tumor activity in the expansion phase of our solid tumor or hematological malignancies clinical trials, we plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss expedited regulatory strategies such as Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations. 
 
 
• | Target enzyme-based therapeutic opportunities within IEM and oncology that have a defined blood-base mechanism of action and known disease pathways.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our focus is on those rare genetic diseases and cancers where we have a deep understanding of their biology and have proof-of-mechanism that our approach plays a crucial role in addressing unmet needs in cancer and rare genetic diseases. Our lead product candidate AEB1102 has shown proof-of-mechanism in degrading blood arginine levels in patients with Arginase I deficiency, advanced solid tumors, and the hematological malignancies AML and MDS. Similarly, the dependence of various cancers on arginine is well understood and documented in the scientific and medical literature. We believe that developing product candidates that directly impact known disease pathways will increase the probability of success of our development programs.
 
 
• | Develop and implement our precision medicine strategy to increase the probability of clinical success.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
An integral part of our product development programs is a precision medicine strategy designed to identify patients that will benefit most from amino acid depletion therapy. In the United States, we are working to optimize newborn screening methods to more accurately identify patients with Arginase I deficiency. In oncology, we are exploring the predictive value of candidate biomarkers to identify patients with tumors sensitive to amino acid deprivation. We believe that targeting these patients may lead to potential proof-of-concept earlier in clinical development and a greater chance of success of treating their cancers effectively. When necessary, we intend to facilitate the development of companion diagnostics with the help of technology partners to aid us in identifying patients whose tumors may be susceptible to amino acid depletion therapy.
 
 
• | Concurrently develop and commercialize multiple product candidates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Development of multiple engineered human enzyme therapeutics generates organizational efficiencies and economies of scale. As a result, we believe we can concurrently develop several clinical-stage product candidates, resulting in a more diversified portfolio that provides multiple opportunities to create value. In addition, we have built an internal team of research scientists to work independently in our own research laboratory to 
 5

leverage our relationships with the University of Texas at Austin and other academic institutions to expand our portfolio of product candidates. Similarly, our Clinical Operations and Medical Sciences teams have created a network of leading medical institutions eager to investigate our pipeline in future clinical trials.
 
 
• | Seek global approval and commercialization of our product candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We retain worldwide intellectual property rights for all of our product candidates. We will pursue clinical and regulatory programs for approval in the United States and internationally. Our plan is to establish a focused commercial organization in the United States and strategically evaluate partnership opportunities internationally.
 
Our Focus—Abnormal Amino Acid Metabolism
 Our company was founded to develop therapeutics for diseases characterized by abnormal amino acid metabolism. Metabolism refers to fundamental chemical reactions that are critical to life-sustaining processes. Metabolism follows specific pathways that are comprised of various biochemical reactions generally catalyzed by proteins known as enzymes. Enzymes accelerate complex reactions and serve as key regulators of metabolic pathways by responding to changes in the cell’s environment or signals from other cells.
 An in-depth understanding of abnormal metabolic pathways is crucial to developing therapies that may address various disease states, including rare genetic diseases and cancer. Our core capability of exploiting the metabolic pathways of IEMs has allowed us to develop engineered human enzyme therapies with the potential to reduce toxic levels of amino acids that may lead to novel, disease-modifying treatments for these rare genetic diseases. In addition, with our focus on the innovative field of cancer cell metabolism, we strive to leverage our engineered human enzyme product candidates to degrade the key nutrients needed for cancer cell survival and proliferation. The mechanism of action of our drugs also presents the potential for novel combination therapies when used together with existing or emerging standards of care.
 Background on inborn errors of metabolism
 Enzymatic defects in metabolic processes contribute to a class of genetic diseases known as IEM. These are a broad group of hundreds of rare genetic diseases where the defect in a single metabolic enzyme disrupts the normal functioning of a metabolic pathway. These defects lead either to abnormal accumulation of upstream metabolites that may be toxic or interfere with normal function, or to a reduced ability to synthesize essential downstream metabolites.
 Most of these diseases often have severe or life-threatening characteristics. The incidence of a single IEM often occurs in fewer than one per 100,000 live births. Many IEMs are likely to be under-diagnosed. Current treatment options for many of these disorders are limited. Diet modification or nutrient supplementation can be beneficial in some IEMs. Several of these disorders have been treated successfully with enzyme therapy. We are targeting a urea cycle disorder, Arginase I deficiency, for our lead product candidate, AEB1102. This cycle has the principle function of detoxifying ammonia, a normal byproduct of amino acid metabolism. Arginase I reduces arginine levels, and is the final step of the urea cycle, releasing urea for secretion by the kidney. While a protein restricted diet is part of the treatment regimen for Arginase I deficiency, it is not effective in normalizing blood arginine due to the body’s continued production and processing of ammonia that results in continued production of arginine. Symptoms resulting from defects in the urea cycle metabolic pathway, such as hyperammonemic encephalopathy, have been the successful target of other drug development efforts including RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate) and BUPHENYL (sodium phenylacetate) which help to remove ammonia. Despite the acceptance of dietary restrictions and these drugs, they do not treat the underlying cause of the disease. We believe that AEB1102 represents a potential therapeutic candidate to treat the excess levels of arginine resulting from Arginase I deficiency.
 
Emerging areas in cancer therapy
 Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2016 there were approximately 1.7 million new cases and approximately 596,000 deaths from cancer in the United States. Cancer originates from defects in the cell’s genetic code, or DNA, that disrupt the mechanisms that normally prevent uncontrolled cell growth.
 Beyond chemotherapeutics and targeted drug therapies, several new approaches to the development of novel cancer treatments are underway. These approaches include, but are not limited to treatment with drugs or other methods that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells, antibody drug conjugates that carry a powerful chemotherapy payload that is only released into targeted cancer cells, drugs that target the changes in gene activity that occur in cancer cells and drugs that target oncogenic drivers in patients with tumor types that harbor genetically similar alterations.
 6

We believe that the altered metabolism of cancer cells—the atypical uptake and break down of nutrients—also provides an opportunity to develop important new cancer treatments. Cancer cells rapidly change how they take-up and utilize nutrients. These adaptations fuel tumor growth and protect cancer cells from the damage caused by reactive oxygen species, or ROS, and various immune system responses. However, while cancer cell metabolic abnormalities fuel tumor growth, they also expose vulnerabilities that can be targeted to selectively destroy tumor cells. It is our belief that depriving cancer cells of key amino acids that are essential for cell survival and tumor growth will provide an effective treatment for some cancers, both as single agent and in combination with existing or emerging standards of care. Additionally, even though the dependence of different cancers on specific amino acids has been known for many years, it has not been widely exploited in the clinical setting.
 Enzyme-based therapies that degrade amino acids have shown clinical benefit in the treatment of cancer. For example, Oncaspar (pegaspargase) and Erwinaze (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi) were approved as part of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Degrading the amino acid asparagine with an E. coli-derived enzyme, Oncaspar (pegaspargase) in combination with chemotherapy generates much improved remission rates as compared to chemotherapy alone.  In addition, arginine dependence of tumors has been reported in the scientific and medical literature to result in responses to a microbial-derived arginine-degrading enzyme in trials with AML, mesothelioma, and melanoma. However, despite the reported clinical impact, this microbial-derived arginine degrading enzyme elicited an immune response that neutralizes the activity of the drug and therefore may result in limited clinical utility.
 
The use of microbial enzymes as therapeutics is often limited by an immune response to a foreign protein. We expect our enzyme product candidates, which are engineered from human proteins, will be less likely to elicit an immune response as compared to microbial enzymes, and to date we have not observed any patients in our clinical trials who have experienced an immune response to, or an adverse event that suggested an immune response to, AEB1102. We believe our technology should provide greater flexibility with respect to the target amino acids that can be addressed. 
 By depriving cancer cells of what we believe are key amino acids via our engineered human enzyme product candidates, we provide a novel approach that, when used alone or in combination with existing or emerging standards of care, has the potential to be a new and effective treatment paradigm for cancer patients. Published literature suggests that a variety of cancers could potentially respond to amino acid deprivation resulting from enzyme therapies, which offers us many potential targets for cancer treatment opportunities.
 Our Development Programs
 The following table summarizes our development programs:
 

AEB1102 (pegzilarginase)
 AEB1102 is human Arginase I, engineered to reduce arginine levels to treat patients with Arginase I deficiency, and arginine-dependent solid tumors and the hematological malignancies AML and MDS. Following completion of dosing for the first two adult patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Arginase I deficiency, we submitted a protocol amendment in November 2016 to broaden the scope of our Phase 1 trial into a Phase 1/2 trial. The amended 
 7

protocol includes dosing of pediatric patients (two and older) and weekly repeat dosing, with the intent to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical response of AEB1102 in patients with this IEM. In the first quarter of 2017, we received IRB approval for the Phase 1/2 protocol for the treatment of patients with Arginase I deficiency at two clinical trial sites. In March 2017, we received an information request from the FDA which included comments and recommendations on the protocol amendment and a request for supporting documents based on their review of our completed toxicology studies, our dose escalation plan and our information to support the inclusion of pediatric patients. As recommended by the FDA, we replied with supporting information and requested a follow-up meeting. At this time, we believe our Phase 1/2 protocol provides an appropriate path to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AEB1102 in pediatric patients, and pending FDA feedback, we plan to initiate dosing in pediatric patients in the middle of 2017. In March 2017, we announced results from the first two adult patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of Arginase I deficiency at the ACMG Annual Meeting. We intend to continue enrollment of adult patients and plan to dose additional adult patients in the middle of 2017. Topline data from this trial is expected in the first half of 2018.
 We are currently conducting two Phase 1 clinical trials. In October 2015, we initiated our Phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. We expect to announce results of this Phase 1 dose escalation in patients with advanced solid tumors and anticipate initiating expansion arms in specific solid tumor types, potentially in combination with existing or emerging standards of care, in the fourth quarter of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018. We are also conducting a Phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with the hematological malignancies AML and MDS and expect to announce results for this trial in the fourth quarter of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018. After the completion of these dose escalation trials, we plan to initiate expansion arms in both specific solid tumors and AML and MDS. If we see compelling evidence of anti-tumor activity in the expansion phase, we plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss expedited regulatory strategies. Additionally, we plan to initiate a Phase 1b/2 trial, potentially in combination with existing or emerging standards of care in one or more solid tumor types and hematological malignancies. 
 AEB1102 background, preliminary clinical data in oncology
 AEB1102 is being evaluated in two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials in oncology indications. The Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors is an ongoing, open-label, multiple dose, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AEB1102. The primary objectives of the dose escalation stage are to determine the maximum tolerated dose, as well as to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of AEB1102. The inclusion criteria include patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. These include adult patients whose tumors have failed to or progressed under standard treatment, cannot tolerate standard therapies or for which no standard therapy exists. We expect that up to 48 patients will be enrolled in the dose-escalation portion of the trial, depending on the number of dose levels studied and the adverse effects observed.  
 This Phase 1 trial was initiated in October 2015. To date, we have treated 8 cohorts consisting of 29 patients in total. 
 The following charts show a persistence of active AEB1102 in the blood over time and a dose-dependent reduction in blood arginine in patients with advanced solid tumors:

 The data presented are preliminary and are subject to change. While these data provide proof-of-mechanism for AEB1102 in humans, these data may not necessarily be predictive of the final results of all patients intended to be enrolled in this Phase 1 trial or in future trials. While we have seen serious adverse events in this trial, including hypercalcemia, bacteremia, pericardial effusion, respiratory failure and death due to progressive cancer, to date these events were considered to be related to the underlying cancer and not considered to be related to AEB1102. The safety profile observed in the study supports continued dose escalation.
 AEB1102 is being evaluated in a second Phase 1 trial for the treatment of the hematological malignancies AML and MDS. This Phase 1, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, dose escalation trial of AEB1102 for the treatment of hematological malignancies is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of AEB1102 as a single agent.  The trial is enrolling patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS refractory to hypomethylating agents. Key objectives of the trial include determining the maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (including reduction of circulating levels of arginine) and the recommended Phase 2 dose. An expansion cohort will be enrolled at the maximally tolerated or biologically relevant dose. We expect that up to 48 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation portion of this trial and an additional ten patients will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose level to further evaluate safety at this dose level.
 To date, three cohorts consisting of a total of 11 patients have been treated and a reduction in blood arginine levels has been observed in all patients. Given the nature of the patient population enrolled in this trial, we expect to and have observed serious adverse events in some of these patients. These serious adverse events have included a rise in white blood cell counts, fever, gout, pain, low potassium, pneumonia, worsening of the patients’ underlying cancer progression, and death due to cancer progression. To date, only one serious adverse event, consisting of nausea and vomiting, has been considered to be possibly related to AEB1102.
 At the end of our Phase 1 dose escalation in solid tumors, we intend to initiate expansion arms in different tumor types, which we have yet to determine. We anticipate that up to 75 patients may be enrolled in these expansion arms. The primary objective of the expansion phase is to assess safety and preliminary antitumor efficacy across these tumor types. These tumor types will be selected based on the biology underlying their development and the preclinical evidence generated by our research team. We also intend to initiate an additional Phase 1b/2 expansion trial to evaluate AEB1102, potentially in combination with an existing or emerging standard of care in one or more solid tumor types and hematological malignancies.
 The selection of the solid tumor types for the Phase 1 expansion arms arises from our biomarker strategy, which is composed of two parts. First, we plan to confirm and extend the published scientific literature on the biomarkers of arginine dependence in multiple tumor types. Based on those data, we plan to further assess the predictive value of the biomarkers in patient-derived xenograft models, which are based on testing drug activity in patient tumor fragments. The results of these experiments, along with the results from our dose-escalation stage, will inform the choice of specific cancer indications for our expansion arms. If we use a biomarker-based test to identify and only enroll patients in clinical trials with tumors that express the biomarker, we expect that the FDA will require the development and regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic assay as a condition to approval of the product candidate for that indication.
 Arginase I deficiency background
 Arginase I deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Arginase I gene, ARG1, leading to the inability to degrade arginine in the urea cycle. Patients with this disease are predisposed to neurologic symptoms including cognitive deficits and seizures and frequently suffer from spasticity, loss of ambulation, and severe intellectual disability.
 Arginase I deficiency is a urea cycle disorder, with a reported incidence of 1:350,000 to 1:1,000,000 live births. It is believed that approximately 500-600 individuals in the United States and Europe suffer from Arginase I deficiency. Although Arginase I deficiency is a rare genetic disease, we believe our working relationships with the IEM health care providers, Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium, and the National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation patient advocacy group will assist in the identification of candidates for our clinical trials. Through these relationships, we have identified more than 40 treating physicians with over 50 patients with Arginase I deficiency in the United States and Europe to date. Because neonatal blood testing for this disorder did not become common in the United States until 2006, we believe that approximately half of those individuals identified in the United States are younger than 18. However, due to screening requirements and enrollment restrictions in our amended clinical trial protocol, or any additional restrictions that may be imposed by the FDA, not all pediatric patients, if any at all, may be eligible for inclusion in our Phase 1/2 trial in the United States. The onset of symptoms typically occurs between one and three years of age and diagnosis in the United States most often occurs through newborn blood screening for this disease, which takes place in 32 U.S. states. Because the symptoms of Arginase I deficiency are similar to a number of other ailments, including cerebral palsy, we believe the 
 9

incidence and prevalence of Arginase I deficiency are likely underestimated in regions such as Europe that do not mandate newborn blood screening for this disease.
 There is no approved therapeutic agent that addresses the cause of Arginase I deficiency, although the medical literature suggests that disease progression can be slowed with strict adherence to dietary protein restriction. Dietary modification, which requires the use of specially formulated supplements, can reduce plasma arginine levels. This therapy is inadequate for treating the majority of patients with Arginase I deficiency, is difficult to manage, is poorly tolerated and is expensive. Therapy with the ammonia scavenging drugs RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate) or BUPHENYL (sodium phenylacetate) can be used to reduce elevated ammonia levels but does not appear to affect circulating arginine. Liver transplantation has been reported to be effective in patients to achieve normalization of arginine levels, but despite these successes, this intervention is available to only a small fraction of patients and carries a significant risk of mortality and morbidity.
 The lack of existing treatment options that directly address the cause of Arginase I deficiency points to the need for a therapy that will lower arginine levels to within the normal range and promote the lifelong maintenance of normal arginine levels. The development of such a therapeutic and its initiation early in a patient’s life could potentially minimize the exposure to the neurotoxic effects of arginine and its metabolites, and offer the potential for normal development in these patients.
 AEB1102 clinical development in Arginase I deficiency
 AEB1102 is intended to replace the function of Arginase I in patients, and return their elevated arginine levels to the normal physiological range. Normalization of arginine levels is anticipated to slow or halt the progression of the disease in these patients. Our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Arginase I deficiency will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical response of AEB1102 in patients with this IEM. 
 
Topline results of our Phase 1 clinical trial have shown AEB1102 to be effective in lowering blood arginine in two adult patients with Arginase I deficiency. AEB1102 was well tolerated with no adverse events or other clinical changes reported in this trial. Plasma arginine levels decreased in a dose-proportional manner after AEB1102 infusions. One patient stopped dose escalation after plasma arginine levels measured below 40 µM after the second dose (0.03 mg/kg), and the other patient stopped after the third dose (0.06 mg/kg) after plasma arginine levels measured below 40 µM.    
 
The following chart shows the pharmacodynamic effect of AEB1102 administration in our Phase 1 clinical trial in two adult patients with Arginase I deficiency.
 

We have obtained orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA, and Fast Track Designation from the FDA, for AEB1102 for the treatment of patients with Arginase I deficiency. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation for drugs 
 10

or biologics designed to treat disorders affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.  If the data from our Phase 1/2 trial is supportive, we may seek to accelerate our development plan for AEB1102 by requesting to use established regulatory pathways, such as Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Regardless of whether we receive this designation, we anticipate initiating a Phase 3 registration directed trial enrolling 15 to 30 patients.  If successful, we expect that this trial would support a BLA filing with the FDA.
 We have met with the FDA on two occasions regarding the pathway for potential approval of AEB1102 for the treatment of Arginase I deficiency. Although the FDA recommended in our 2014 Pre-IND meeting that we measure age appropriate neurocognitive outcomes in our trials for marketing approval under the regular approval pathway, the FDA has agreed that the primary endpoint of our Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials could be the normalization of blood arginine levels; provided that we can provide adequate justification that normalization of plasma arginine in the target population is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. To do this, we believe the FDA expects some evidence of consistent trends in the stabilization or improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of Arginase I deficiency to be observed in the Phase 3 trial to support the primary endpoint. The FDA has suggested that we investigate multiple endpoints that can show a clinically meaningful benefit, such as neurocognitive outcomes and quality-of-life measurements, and not necessarily focus on achieving a statistically significant result (usually measured by a statistical value that indicates the likelihood that the result is not due to chance) on a single clinical endpoint, given the small number of patients expected to be enrolled in this trial. The FDA stated that the Phase 3 trial length and design will need to be adequate to assess safety in the target population, stated that it is not clear that the time needed to show an effect on a biomarker will be an adequate duration to characterize safety and recommended that we reach agreement with the FDA on the duration of such a trial if we decide to pursue an accelerated approval development plan. Finally, if we obtain expedited approval, we may be required to conduct a post-approval controlled trial that verifies clinical benefit in neurocognitive outcomes, and the FDA has stated that it expects the verification study to be underway at the time of accelerated approval. In March 2017, we received an information request from the FDA which included comments and recommendations on the protocol amendment and a request for supporting documents based on their review of our completed toxicology studies, our dose escalation plan and our information to support the inclusion of pediatric patients. As recommended by the FDA, we replied with supporting information and requested a follow-up meeting. At this time, we believe our Phase 1/2 protocol provides an appropriate path to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AEB1102 in pediatric patients, and pending FDA feedback, we plan to initiate dosing in pediatric patients in the middle of 2017. With respect to Arginase I deficiency, we do not expect to need FDA regulatory approval of any diagnostic test prior to obtaining approval, if any, of AEB1102 for that indication. A widely adopted neonatal blood test for Arginase I deficiency currently exists, which is a part of mandatory newborn screening in 32 U.S. states and is incorporated into routine care for diagnosis and treatment of patients with Arginase I deficiency.
 
AEB1102 background in oncology
 We are targeting the dependence of some cancers on the amino acid arginine using AEB1102. Arginine is considered a semi-essential amino acid since in some circumstances cells cannot make sufficient amounts of arginine. These circumstances include conditions of enhanced proliferation, tissue injury or stress. The role of arginine and its metabolites in cancer has been studied extensively in preclinical models with demonstrated effects, including enhancement of tumor growth and cellular proliferation. Conversely, restriction of dietary arginine attenuates tumor growth and metastasis in experimental tumor models.
 Many types of cancers lose the ability to synthesize intracellular arginine, principally due to deficiency in the expression of any one or more of the following enzymes—ornithine transcarbamoylase, or OTC, argininosuccinate synthase1, or ASS1 and argininosuccinate lyase, or ASL. As a result, these cancers depend on extracellular arginine uptake. When deprived of this tumor-essential nutrient, cancer cells die, establishing a correlation between their inability to synthesize arginine and vulnerability to arginine deprivation. As set forth in the figure below, based on data from our preclinical studies and the published scientific and medical literature, Arginase I degrades arginine to ornithine and urea. Ornithine cannot be used to make arginine by any cancer cells that lack expression of OTC, ASS or ASL.

As documented in scientific and medical literature and from our own preclinical research, the lack of expression of any one or more of the enzymes OTC, ASS1 or ASL in tumor cells has been shown to be a predictive biomarker for arginine dependent cancer cells. Our preclinical research has focused on the reduced or loss of expression of ASS1 as the predominate cause of tumor arginine dependence.

Low or no expression of ASS1 in patient derived xenograft models from patients with melanoma or small lung cancer results in sensitivity to arginine depletion by AEB1102 in preclinical models, as shown below.

Emerging cancer therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated a significant clinical benefit in melanoma. When AEB1102 was tested in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4 additive or synergistic inhibition of tumor growth was observed in CT-26, MC-38, and Lewis Lung mouse tumor allograft models. One example of a synergistic response in combination with a PDL-1 inhibitor in our preclinical studies is shown below.
 

 In this preclinical study, when AEB1102 was administered in combination with anti-PD-L1 for at least 8 weeks, a 37% frequency of complete tumor regression was observed. When the tumor-free mice were re-injected with fresh tumor cells, the tumor failed to establish, suggesting the development of an immune memory response as a result of the previously administered combination therapy of AEB1102 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody.
 Targeting cysteine/cystine and oxidative stress for oncology
 Reactive oxygen species, or ROS, have been widely reported in the scientific and clinical research literature to have enhanced production in tumors creating oxidative stress, resulting in damage to lipids, membranes, structural and functional proteins and DNA of the tumor cells. Major sources of oxidative stress in cancer include: metabolic activities due to aberrant growth-promoting pathways, infiltrating inflammatory cells, as well as standards of care such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The antioxidant glutathione is a key natural protector of ROS-mediated damage and has an enhanced role in protecting tumor cells from high levels of ROS. To survive in this hostile environment, cancer cells produce high levels of glutathione which preferentially reacts with and neutralizes the otherwise damaging ROS. Glutathione cannot be transported into cells from outside the cell, and must be synthesized in each cell. In order to satisfy the tumor’s demand for glutathione, an adequate supply of cysteine/cystine is required. Reducing available 
 13

cysteine/cystine from outside the cell decreases the levels of glutathione, increasing ROS-related damage to cancer cells and triggering cancer cell death.
 The production of ROS is both an initiator as well as a promoter of cancer, requiring increased production of glutathione for the cancer cells to survive. However, many cancer treatments are also cytotoxic through the production of ROS. This apparent paradox is receiving increased attention as a potential tumor vulnerability, and underlies the mechanistic rationale for selective tumor killing by using a therapeutic enzyme to reduce available cysteine/cystine in the blood. While chemotherapy and radiation therapies are often highly efficient at eliminating the bulk of cancer cells, treatment-resistant cancer stem cells are highly resistant to ROS-mediated damage and survive anti-cancer therapy. These cancer stem cells are thought to be a cause of patient relapse.
 Cancer stem cells are protected from ROS stress through increased glutathione production in both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Based on an extensive body of evidence from the scientific and clinical research literature, we believe targeting the glutathione dependence of cancer will not only have direct anti-tumor activity but may also show synergy in combination with standards of care, depleting the cancer stem cell populations to provide a prolonged benefit to patients.
 AEB3103
 AEB3103, our lead product candidate in this program, is an engineered human enzyme that targets the degradation of the amino acid cysteine/cystine. To our knowledge, the human genome does not encode a native cysteine- or cysteine-degrading enzyme. Initial efficacy testing in preclinical models demonstrated significant depletion of glutathione and significantly increased levels of ROS in HMVP2 prostate cancer cells. As shown below, in vivo AEB3103 demonstrated a statistically significant depletion of glutathione and significantly increased levels of ROS in HMVP2 prostate cancer cells. The treatment appeared to be well tolerated as the tested animals showed no change in appetite or weight loss. 
 

As shown in the following chart, AEB3103 also improved survival in a mouse genetic model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Targeting methionine dependence for oncology
 The dependence of tumors on the essential amino acid methionine for survival has been described extensively in the scientific and medical literature, with the demand of some tumors for methionine far exceeding that of normal tissues. This dependence has been exploited in the clinic as a diagnostic where an analog of methionine is the preferred contrast agent for imaging of glioblastomas, astrocytomas and melanoma metastases to the brain. This is because methionine supports five metabolic pathways which promote tumor growth, protecting tumor cells from a hostile environment, and ultimately forms the rationale for using methionine starvation to target tumor cells. Over 40 years of research on tumor methionine dependence has been built on the use of a bacterial methionine-degrading enzyme. This microbial enzyme never advanced in clinical development, but provided a strong rationale for targeting methionine dependence in tumors.
 The finding of tumor methionine dependence led to efforts to attempt dietary manipulation as an anti-cancer therapy. These efforts provided evidence of limited activity, but did not reduce methionine levels sufficiently. Enzyme-mediated methionine depletion in animals has resulted in far lower serum levels than nutritional restrictions can achieve, suggesting that our therapeutic approach with an engineered human methionine-degrading enzyme may achieve meaningfully improved efficacy in combination with standard of care.
 Because there are specific metabolic pathways dependent on methionine metabolism, we believe methionine depletion used in combination with a variety of chemotherapeutics will be complementary to enzyme-mediated methionine depletion in blood, and may result in synergistic effects. We anticipate new treatment paradigms utilizing this approach, if successfully developed and approved, will have a significant impact with both improved patient responses and long term outcomes.
 AEB2109
 AEB2109, our lead enzyme in this program, is an engineered human enzyme that targets the degradation of the amino acid methionine. To our knowledge, the human genome does not encode a native methionine-degrading enzyme. Earlier work from our enzyme engineering program has been presented in the scientific literature describing activity in an animal tumor model. We believe AEB2109 provides us with the opportunity to exploit a tumor vulnerability that has been recognized for over 40 years, but not yet successfully exploited for therapeutic benefit. We plan to continue our preclinical development efforts for AEB2109 and, if appropriate, proceed to IND-enabling studies with a development candidate from this program.
 AEB4104 and additional pipeline opportunities
 Our ongoing research efforts have identified various opportunities to leverage our expertise in the field of enzyme biochemistry to develop product candidates targeting various IEM and tumor metabolism mechanisms. We are currently in the early discovery stages for an engineered human enzyme therapy with AEB4104, the most advanced enzyme in that program, targeting the reduction of elevated levels of the amino acid homocysteine. Elevated blood levels of this amino acid arise in the IEM called classical homocystinuria. We believe that classical homocystinuria represents a viable market opportunity and significant unmet medical need, which we plan to address by continuing our development of AEB4104 and related enzymes. Regarding oncology indications, we will continue to explore other amino acids for targeted enzyme treatments in combination with emerging and current standards of care such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We 
 15

plan to concurrently develop multiple product candidates targeting diseases with clear mechanisms of action and balancing research and development in rare genetic diseases and oncology to maximize value.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights, including in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we are the owner of five U.S. patents, expiring between 2029 and 2031, absent any extensions, three of which are directed to the compositions methods of preparing, and methods of using AEB1102 (pegzilarginase), and two of which are directed to compositions of AEB4104. As of December 31, 2016, we also owned two pending U.S. utility patent applications, one of which is related to pharmaceutical compositions of AEB1102, and the other directed to methods for identifying and selecting primate cystathionine gamma-lyase variants having L-methionine degrading activity. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we also controlled two U.S. utility patent applications, exclusively licensed to us by the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, or the University, including one related to compositions of AEB2109 and one related to compositions of AEB3103 and their use in cancer treatment. Any patents issuing from the foregoing owned or licensed U.S. patent applications are expected to expire in 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we owned a total of five patents and five applications in foreign jurisdictions variously including: Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. Any issued patents, or those issuing from these foreign patent applications, are expected to expire between 2029 and 2031, absent any adjustments or extensions. These foreign patent applications and patents comprise claims that relate to the compositions of AEB1102 and AEB4104 and methods of use of AEB1102 for the treatment of cancer. As of December 31, 2016, we also controlled 14 pending international patent applications in Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, Israel, Japan and Korea, which are also exclusively licensed to us by the University, with claims directed to compositions and methods of use of AEB2109 and compositions and methods of use of AEB3103. Any patents issuing from these applications are expected to expire in 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions.
 Patents may extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary positions for our product candidates, where available.
 We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. In addition, we also require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials.
 Licensing
 On December 24, 2013, two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AECase, Inc., or AECase, and AEMase, Inc., or AEMase, entered into license agreements with the University under which the University has granted to AECase and AEMase exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable licenses. The University granted to AECase a license under a patent application relating to the right to use technology related to our AEB3103 product candidate. The University granted to AEMase license under a patent relating to the right to use technology related to our AEB2109 product candidate. On January 31, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement, or the Restated License, with the University which consolidated the two license agreements dated December 24, 2013, revised certain obligations, and licensed additional patent applications and invention disclosures to Aeglea.
 16

With respect to each product candidate covered by the Restated License, we could be required to pay the University up to $6.4 million in milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development milestones, including clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the majority of which are due upon the achievement of later development milestones, including a $5.0 million payment due on regulatory approval of a product and a $500,000 payment payable on final regulatory approval of a product for a second indication. In addition, we are required to pay the University a low single digit royalty on worldwide-net sales of products covered under the Restated License, together with a revenue share on non-royalty consideration received from sublicensees. The rate of the revenue share ranges from 6.5% to 25%, depending on the date the sublicense agreement is signed. The term of the Restated License continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents licensed thereunder. The University may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including for a breach by us that is not cured within 30 or 60 days of notice (depending on the type of breach), or if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees participate in any proceeding to challenge the licensed patent rights (unless, with respect to sublicensees, we terminate the applicable sublicense). As of December 31, 2016, we have paid $41,000 under these license agreements.
 Sponsored Research Agreement
 In connection with the above license agreements, we and each of our wholly-owned subsidiaries also entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement, or SRA, with the University on December 24, 2013, which was subsequently amended on September 24, 2014, January 15, 2015, August 10, 2015, November 5, 2015, January 7, 2016, and August 3, 2016. Pursuant to the SRA, we agreed to sponsor research to be conducted at the laboratory of Professor George Georgiou at the University related to the systemic depletion of amino acids for cancer therapy, and enzyme replacement for the treatment of patients having inborn metabolic defects. The SRA will expire on August 31, 2017, and we have the option of extending the research program under mutually agreeable support terms. We can terminate the SRA with 60 days’ notice to the University. The University can terminate the SRA for our material breach that remains uncured 60 days after notice from the University. With respect to intellectual property that results from the sponsored research, each party owns any such intellectual property that it solely creates and we jointly own with the University any such intellectual property that we jointly create. We have an option to negotiate a license to the University’s interest in any such intellectual property and any such license agreement is expected to be on terms substantially similar to the existing license agreements described above. If we fail to enter into such a license agreement within six months of the date we exercise our option (or such longer period of time as we may mutually agree), the University would be free to grant licenses under the applicable intellectual property to third parties. The maximum permitted cost of the sponsored research to us is approximately $2.2 million. This increases if we agree to extend the research program beyond August 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we have paid $1.8 million to the University under the SRA.
Grant Agreement
 In June 2015, we entered into a Cancer Research Grant Contract, or the Grant Contract, with the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT, under which CPRIT awarded us a grant not to exceed $19.8 million to be used to develop novel cancer treatments by exploiting the unique metabolism of cancer cells. As of December 31, 2016, we have recognized $10.7 million in revenue under the Grant Contract and collected $9.6 million in grant proceeds. The Grant Contract expires on May 31, 2018.
 Pursuant to the Grant Contract, we grant to CPRIT a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to any technology and intellectual property resulting from the grant-funded activities and any other intellectual property that is owned by us and necessary for the exploitation of the technology and intellectual property resulting from the grant-funded activities, or the Project Results, for and on behalf of CPRIT and other governmental entities and agencies of the State of Texas and private or independent institutions of higher education located in Texas for education, research and other non-commercial purposes only. The terms of the Grant Contract require that we pay tiered royalties in the low- to mid-single digit percentages on revenues from sales and licenses of products or services that are based upon, utilize, are developed from or materially incorporate Project Results. Such royalties reduce to less than one percent after a mid-single-digit multiple of the grant funds have been repaid to CPRIT in royalties. Such royalties are payable for so long as we have marketing exclusivity or patents covering the applicable product or service (or twelve years from first commercial sale of such product or service in certain countries if there is no such exclusivity or patent protection).
 17

If we abandon patent applications or patents covering Project Results in certain major market countries, CPRIT can, at its own cost, take over the prosecution and maintenance of such patents and is granted a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual license with right to sublicense in such country to the applicable Project Results. We are required to use diligent and commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one commercial product or service or otherwise bring to practical application the Project Results. If CPRIT notifies us of our failure with respect to the foregoing, and such failure is not owing to material safety concerns, then, at CPRIT’s option, the applicable Project Results would be transferred to CPRIT and CPRIT would be granted a non-exclusive license to any other intellectual property that is owned by us and necessary for the exploitation of the Project Results, and CPRIT, at its own cost, can commercialize products or services that are based upon, utilize, are developed from or materially incorporate Project Results. CPRIT’s option is subject to our ability to cure any failures identified by CPRIT within 60 days and a requirement to negotiate in good faith with us with respect to an alternative commercialization strategy for a period of 180 days.
 Competition
 While we believe that our preclinical development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and ultimately biosimilar and generic drug companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, and institutional experience.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address IEM and cancer metabolism.
 Inborn errors of metabolism.    With respect to AEB1102 for Arginase I deficiency, there are currently no approved therapeutics that address the underlying cause of the disease and we are not aware of any other therapeutics that do so in clinical development. It is possible that competitors may produce, develop, and commercialize therapeutics, or utilize other approaches to treat Arginase I deficiency. The current method for treating patients with Arginase I deficiency includes dietary restriction, which appears to slow the disease progression, as well as treatments such as Hyperion Therapeutics’ RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate) and BUPHENYL (sodium phenylacetate) which lower blood-ammonia levels.
 Cancer metabolism.    With respect to our oncology product candidates, we compete with other companies that pursue a cancer metabolism approach, as well as companies that employ more common methods of treating patients such as surgery, radiation and drug therapy. These drug therapies include chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drugs, including biologic products such as engineered antibodies.
 There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates will not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events, and none are successful in treating all patients. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high.
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer. While there are currently no approved drugs targeting tumor arginine dependence, we are aware of a number of compounds that are in clinical development and enrolling patients with solid and hematological malignancies, including Polaris Group’s microbial ADI-PEG 20 and Biocancer Treatment International’s pegylated native human Arginase I. Additionally, Calithera Biosciences is targeting a therapy that inhibits Arginase I as an immune modulator. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for our product candidate AEB1102.
 18

Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of assays or tests that are essential to identifying an appropriate patient population, which we refer to as companion diagnostics, in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of biosimilar competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product candidates for nonclinical studies and intend to do so for our future clinical studies as well. We intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide potential alternative sources for the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services for AEB1102 as the compound progresses through clinical development, prior to seeking marketing approval from FDA. We believe we have sufficient supplies of AEB1102 for our ongoing and planned Phase 1 clinical trials.
The KBI Agreement
 In December 2013, we entered into a Master Services Agreement, or KBI Agreement, with KBI Biopharma, Inc., or KBI, in which KBI agreed to research, develop and manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient for AEB1102 in exchange for cash and shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock. In June 2015, we amended the KBI Agreement to also permit us to exchange Series B convertible preferred stock for such research, development and manufacturing services. The KBI Agreement was further amended in June 2015 to convert the remaining unmet milestone awards from share-based payments to cash. The KBI Agreement has an initial three-year term and automatically renews for successive additional one-year terms until the services are completed. The KBI Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach that is not remedied within thirty days after notice or in the event of a bankruptcy by either party. We may terminate the KBI Agreement upon sixty-days written notice. For termination other than a material breach by KBI, we must pay for all services conducted prior to the termination and to wind down the activities.
The LSNE Agreement
 In November 2014, we entered into a Master Services Agreement, or LSNE Agreement, with Lyophilization Services of New England, Inc., or LSNE, in which LSNE agreed to manufacture the finished product of AEB1102 for clinical testing in exchange for cash. The LSNE Agreement has a one-year term that we may unilaterally extend for successive one-year periods upon written notice. The LSNE Agreement may be terminated for either party for a material breach that is not remedied within thirty-days after notice or in the event of a bankruptcy by either party. We may terminate the contract for convenience upon written notice, but must pay termination fees.
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing is relatively cost-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development.
 For our biomarker and companion diagnostic strategies, we will rely on third-party vendors for the development and execution of our tests. If we choose to develop a biomarker-based test, including a companion diagnostic, for any of our therapeutic enzymes, we may rely on one or more third parties to manufacture and sell a single test.
 19

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 FDA approval process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 20

Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.  This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the law or the initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. While these fees are typically increased annually, they decreased from Fiscal Year 2016 to Fiscal Year 2017. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the BLA; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
 21

Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
 Fast track designation and accelerated approval
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Under the fast track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Breakthrough therapy designation
 The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 Orphan drug designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 22

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same principal molecular structural features for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
 Disclosure of clinical trial information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 Additional controls for biologics
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
 After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
 Patent term restoration
 After approval, owners of relevant drug or biologic patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND application and NDA or BLA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA or BLA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 23

For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug or biologic for which an NDA or BLA has not been submitted.
 Biosimilars
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. To date, only a handful of biosimilar products and no interchangeable products have been approved under the BPCIA. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation, which is still being evaluated by the FDA.
 A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 Post-approval requirements
 Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 24

FDA regulation of companion diagnostics
 If use of an in vitro diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA has generally required  in vitro  companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a pre-market approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these  in vitro  companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $230,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 Other U.S. healthcare laws and compliance requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 25

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
 HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 26

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and 
 27

reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare reform
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the ACA, which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. The ACA will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs.
 Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs, that began in 2011;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We anticipate that the ACA will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 Additional regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and 
 28

governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 Europe / rest of world government regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
