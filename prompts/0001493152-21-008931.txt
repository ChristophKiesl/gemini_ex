Ozop Energy Systems
 
Overview
 
On December 11, 2020, the Company formed Ozop Energy Systems, Inc. (“OES”), a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OES was formed to be a manufacturer and distributor of renewable energy products.
 
OES is actively engaged in the renewable, electric vehicle (“EV”), energy storage and energy resiliency sectors. In addition to its current East Coast location, the Company recently signed a letter of intent to a four- year lease of approximately 10,000 SF in California. We are engaged in multiple business lines that include Project Development as well as Equipment Distribution. Our solar and energy storage projects involve large-scale battery and solar photovoltaics (PV) installations. The utility-scale storage business is based on an arbitrage business model in which we install multiple 1+ megawatt batteries, charge them with off-peak grid electricity under contract with the utility, then sell the power back during peak load hours at a premium, as dictated by prevailing electricity tariffs.
 
Solar PV: Our PV business model involves the design and construction of electrical generating PV systems that can resell power to the utilities or be used for off grid use as part of our developing Neo-Grids solution. The Neo-Grids proprietary program, patent/s pending, was developed for the off-grid distribution of electricity to reduce the rates, fees and charges currently burdening the EV Charging and residential carport sectors. It will also reduce the lengthy permitting processes and streamline the installations.
 
Electric Vehicle Chargers: The Neo-Grids, patent pending, is comprised of the design engineering, installation, and operational methodologies as well as the financial arbitrage of how we produce, capture and distribute electrical energy for the EV markets. Neo-Grids will serve both the private auto and the commercial sectors. OES has license rights to the proprietary “flow” that was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in March 2021. The exponential growth of the EV industry has been accelerated by the recent major commitments of most of the major car manufacturers. Our Neo-Grids business model leverages this accelerated growth by offering (1) charging locations that can be installed at a significant discount to utility-tied installations and (2) EV charger electricity that is both renewable and less expensive than comparable grid supplied power as offered by local suppliers.
 
OES has developed a business plan for the Neo Grids distribution solution that is being executed now and will be coming out of Research & Development for proof of concept in Q3 2021. Having identified several manufacturers and established a supply line for EV chargers, we have entered into agreements for EV charger installations as part of this proof of concept and plan to service them under multi-year agreements.
 
Equipment Distributor: Building on that, OES has entered the component supply/distribution side of the renewable, resiliency and energy storage industries distributing the core components associated with commercial solar PV systems as well as onsite battery storage and power generation. The components we are distributing include PV panels, solar inverters, solar mounting systems, stationary batteries, onsite generators and other associated electrical equipment and components that are all manufactured by multiple companies, both domestic and international. These core products are sourced from management-developed relationships and are distributed through our existing network and our in-house sales team.
 
OES management has decades of experience in the renewable, storage and resilient energy businesses and associated markets, which include but are not limited to project finance, project development, equipment finance, construction, utility protocol, regulatory policy and technology assessment.

PCTI
 
Business Strategy
 
PCTI has the technology and capability to enter the solar inverter and energy storage market since many of these technologies are being manufactured outside of the U.S. The U.S. has a manufacturing sector for racking and a small sector for modules, but inverters and energy storage are not as robust domestically. PCTI is working to bring a line of both solar inverters and stationary energy storage products to market.
 
The current solar inverter market is dominated by five companies: SMA, CPS Solar, SolarEdge, Solectria and Enphase. PCTI is planning to develop a line of large commercial/industrial inverters for the solar industry that are in a similar space as their current line of inverters. PCTI will also analyze the utility inverter market for large scale/utility solar and wind generation. The Company will continue to evaluate the residential and small commercial inverter market to determine if this is a segment to enter in the future.
 
PCTI wants to engage the energy storage market. Developing energy storage products will not only serve the current needs of the renewable energy and utility markets for frequency regulation but also the long-term needs of addressing capacity issues that exist with or without renewable energy. PCTI is also currently using its unique mobile energy storage inverters and battery chargers to expand upon its capabilities within the maritime and container terminal industry.
 
Electric Vehicle Chargers
 
PCTI is analyzing the best way to apply their technology to the rapidly growing EV industry also zeroing in on EV charging stations. PCTI is analyzing the potential of providing the infrastructure for EV charging hubs for passenger vehicles and for heavy duty EVs. The heavy duty EV market has seen rapid growth in school busses, drayage trucks, Yard Hostlers, etc. and the costs of manufacturing these heavy duty EV’s has been decreasing rapidly, creating a need for heavy duty EV charging stations. The Heavy Duty Truck Electrification Market has a forecast of the compound annual growth rate of 14.3% and $25.5 Billion by 2027. The Global Electric Vehicle Market, valued at $118 Billion in 2017, is expected to reach $567 Billion by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 22.3%. Similar to heavy duty trucks and multiple EV charging stations, electric vessels for marine applications such as ferry boats are growing and present an opportunity for PCTI battery chargers.
Solar Inverters
 
PCTI sees an opportunity in entering the solar inverter market by using their existing technologies and applying them directly to the needs of solar inverters. The Company will be analyzing the existing market of foreign made inverters to provide a more substantial American made option. It will be the goal of PCTI to determine how to get the price point to be competitive as well as make sure new safety and fire codes are applied to their product as more states and countries are adopting codes such as these. The global solar inverter market is projected to be at $12.8 billion in 2020 and to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.5% from 2020 to 2025.
Our Principal Products and Services
 
PCTI has four main product lines: DC Power Supplies from 5KW to 2MW, Battery chargers from 5KW to 2MW, DC/AC inverters to 1.5MVA and frequency converters up to 1MVA.

Utility Scale Energy Storage
 
Utility Scale Energy Storage offers a number of advantages to the grid operators, power generators and end users. By incorporating energy storage into different sections of the grid it allows renewables to be more efficient in dispersing energy when demand is high. It allows utilities to be able to hold onto energy and release it in relation to usage trends. By performing these functions and others it makes the energy on the grid more efficient and less expensive for the end user as well as providing more stability and resiliency when demand is high and brown outs are common. Because PCTI’s inverters and battery chargers are in the highest power segments, they are uniquely suited for the larger utility scale applications.
Following are Utility Scale Energy Storage applications.
 

● | Applications for Pumped Hydro Systems

Competition
 
There are different competitors for each product line that are also further divided by power segment. By serving the high power products sector, we have sought to limit competition and commoditization of our products. We compete as a solution driven company, providing PCTI with what we believe are better margins and larger order values. As we are moving the direction of the company into the renewable energy storage market space, we are aware that some of the competitors have strong brand names. We believe PCTI offers a larger breath of product offering in these power ranges while our competition is fragmented in this area. In the high power segment, we believe PCTI’s experience, technology and flexibility provides a great advantage over other competitors.
 
We compete with many companies in the various application segments including larger, more established companies with substantial capabilities, personnel and financial resources.
 
PCTI is positioning itself to compete in the high power segment, with a focus on renewable energy and EV markets. These two segments are continuously looking to advance their products, which makes it difficult for the larger companies to adjust. We believe this is how PCTI will have an advantage to compete as a solutions driven company.
 
Many of our competitors have a larger presence in global markets. PCTI is also looking to expend its global footprint.
 
Intellectual Property
 
PCTI has a 29-year design library that includes all four product lines as well as some related equipment. One of our advantages over our competitors is our proprietary digital signal processing (DSP) control currently in its 7th generation. To the best of our knowledge, we believe that none of our competitors are using this sophisticated control topology at this time. DSP control permits great flexibility in our designs, allowing us to produce a wide variety of designs in a shorter period of time than our competitors. DSP allows for real-time control and monitoring of the equipment, which is faster than sequential control. This provides significant performance improvement as well as energy savings in the equipment.
 
PCTI additionally has trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture, and testing of the equipment.
 
Research and Development
 
To maintain our level of continuous innovation, PCTI conducts numerous internal R&D projects. Additionally, the unique needs and applications of our customers require that we conduct R&D and engineering in order to provide them with the needed solutions and products.
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company employs 13 full time and 3 part- time employees. Ozop and PCTI have contracts with various independent contractors and consultants to fulfill additional needs, including accounting, investor relations, business development, permitting, and other corporate functions, and may increase staff further as we expand activities and bring new projects on line.
