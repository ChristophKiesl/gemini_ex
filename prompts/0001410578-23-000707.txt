ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
Gardiner Healthcare Acquisitions Corp., which we refer to as “we,” “us” or “the Company,” is a blank check company incorporated on March 25, 2021 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination. We have engaged in an extensive research effort to identify a number of potential targets and have initiated discussions with business combination targets.
On December 27, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering of 7,500,000 units (“Units”), including the common stock included in the Units offered (the “Public Shares”) and warrants, at $10.00 per Unit generating gross proceeds of $75,000,000. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.
Simultaneously with the closing its initial public offering, the Company consummated the sale of 4,450,000 private placement warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Company’s sponsors, Gardiner Holdings, Chardan Gardiner LLC (“Chardan Gardiner”), and CCMAUS Pty Ltd. (“CCMAUS”) (collectively referred to as the “co-sponsors”) generating gross proceeds of $4,450,000. Hereinafter, the consummation of the initial public offering of 7,500,000 units along with the simultaneous consummation of the sale of the 4,450,000 Private Placement Warrants are collectively referred to as the “IPO”.
On December 29, 2021, Chardan Capital Markets LLC (“Chardan”), acting as the representative of the underwriters, exercised in full its over-allotment option to acquire 1,125,000 over-allotment option units at a price of $10.00 per over-allotment option unit (the “Over-allotment Closing”), resulting in total gross proceeds of $11,250,000 to the Company.
Offering costs for the IPO and the Over-allotment Closing amounted to $2,379,906, consisting of $1,875,000 of underwriting fees and $504,906 of other costs. The Company entered into a business combination marketing agreement whereby it is obligated to pay Chardan $3,018,750 (3.5% of the gross proceeds from the IPO and the Over-allotment Closing which is being held in the trust account) contingent upon the consummation of a business combination.
Following the December 27, 2021 closing of the IPO and the December 29, 2021 Over-allotment Closing, $87,112,500 ($10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account. The amounts placed in the trust account are being invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below.
General
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we are focusing on industries that complement our management team’s background, and intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business in the healthcare or healthcare related industries. In particular, we are targeting North American or European companies in the life sciences and medical technology sectors, with a specific focus on small and large molecule therapeutics, where our management team as a whole has extensive operational and investment experience. We may pursue a transaction in which our shareholders immediately prior to the completion of our initial business combination would collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company.
The Company has three co-sponsors: Gardiner Holdings, Chardan Gardiner and CCMAUS.

We are focusing our efforts on identifying a healthcare business that has the potential for high growth. These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
Investment Criteria
We are focusing on identifying high-growth healthcare acquisition targets by leveraging the expertise of our management team, co-sponsor team and the board of directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”). Our broader team maintains robust deal sourcing channels and industry-leading relationships across the healthcare landscape.
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our Board of Directors makes the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to determine independently the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment

banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our Board of Directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We have also agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our co-sponsors. In addition, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
Industry Opportunity
We believe that current dynamics in the life sciences initial public offering market may enhance our ability to locate an attractive target. Hundreds of biotechnology companies have gone public since 2016 in the United States. We also believe that the process for life sciences initial public offerings often produces offerings that are significantly oversubscribed, but where a majority of the offering is allocated to the top ten investors, some of whom may be existing investors in these companies or are industry specialists. As a result, we believe that there may be numerous investors who have not been able to receive meaningful, or any, allocations in recent life sciences and medical technology initial public offerings who may be interested in a potential target opportunity that we identify.
We believe that life sciences companies, at a certain stage in their development, see material benefits from being publicly traded, including greater access to capital, more liquid securities and increased customer awareness. An acquisition by a special purpose acquisition company with a management team that is well-known to, and respected by, life sciences founders, their current third-party investors and their management teams, we believe, can provide a more transparent and efficient mechanism to bring a private healthcare company to the public markets.
An increasing number of the initial public offerings of biotech companies were biotech companies that had not yet to put a drug into the clinic at the time of their initial public offering. Not long ago taking a pre-clinical company public was unusual at best. We believe that the change in sentiment for these young companies reflects the increasing confidence in the science and the ability to translate early results to the patient. With the advent of technology advancements, we believe one can make a much better prediction whether an early-stage biotech company could survive the development gauntlet. By implementing development strategies hard sought by large pharmaceuticals, such as rigorous portfolio management, Phase II entry criteria, and enhanced clinical trial design, we believe that real improvements in program survival can be realized.
Effecting a Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following our IPO, other than searching for a target for an initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the remaining proceeds of our IPO (after redemptions relating to our December 2022 special meeting of stockholders), our shares, new debt, proceeds from the new issuance of securities, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
Since the consummation of the IPO, we have focused on identifying, doing due diligence on and speaking to management of potential target companies in a variety of markets within our target sectors. Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such 

13



initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, this assessment may not result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
Our IPO prospectus and our charter at the time of our IPO provided that we had 12 months from the date of our IPO (until December 27, 2022) to complete a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Our charter at the time of our IPO and the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated December 21, 2021, by and between Gardiner Healthcare Acquisitions Corp. and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as amended (the “Trust Agreement”) provided that we had the right to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination) by depositing into the trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, an amount of $0.10 per unit sold to the public in the IPO for each such three-month extension (each, an “Extension Election”), as described in more detail in our IPO prospectus.
In a special meeting of the stockholders on December 21, 2022, a proposal (the “Extension Amendment Proposal”) to amend our certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination (the “Combination Period”) and a proposal (the “Trust Amendment Proposal”) to amend the Trust Agreement to allow for the extension of the Combination Period were approved by our stockholders, and as a result, we did not have to rely on an Extension Election, but instead we extended the Combination Period for an additional three (3) months, from December 27, 2022 to March 27, 2023, by depositing into the trust account (the “trust account”) $300,000 for a three-month extension, and thereafter we have the right to extend the Combination Period up to three (3) times by an additional month each time (or up to June 27, 2023) by depositing into the trust account $100,000 for each additional month extension (each, an “Extension”). The purpose of the Extensions is to provide the Company more time to complete a business combination, which the Board believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. 
On March 23, 2023, Gardiner Healthcare exercised an Extension and deposited $100,000 into the trust account in order to extend the Combination Period to April 27, 2023.
In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, certain stockholders who owned shares of our common stock issued in our IPO (we refer to such stockholders as “public stockholders” and such shares as “public shares”) elected to redeem all or a portion of their public shares. For stockholders who elected to redeem, the redemption for a per-share price, payable in cash, was equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Company’s trust account, including interest (which interest was net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. As of December 21, 2022, after giving effect to the redemption, there were 4,091,822 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding.
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
Sources of Target Businesses
Target business candidates are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also may introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus relating to our IPO (Registration Statement on Form S-1, File No. 333-260422 (the “Registration Statement”)) as initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 22, 2021, as amended, and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our co-sponsors and their affiliates, 

14



including Chardan, also may bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. We have engaged Chardan to assist us with respect to M&A advisory services in relation to a potential initial business combination. We will be obligated to pay Chardan a fee for such services only in the event that we close an initial business combination. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of other professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We intend to engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee may be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our co-sponsors, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire that such an initial business combination is fair to our public stockholders from a financial point of view.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, or to the extent permitted by law we may acquire interests in a variable interest entity, in which we may have less than a majority of the voting rights in such entity, but in which we are the primary beneficiary. There is no basis for our investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management endeavors to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information made available to us.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses
The target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. If we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least 80% of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will 

15



likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. In order to consummate such an initial business combination, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities. If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our stockholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our stockholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination. We have not entered into any such arrangement to issue our debt or equity securities.
The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our Board of Directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value, enterprise value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. Investors will be relying on the business judgment of our Board of Directors, which have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of a particular target business. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire, that the price we are paying is fair to our public stockholders.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, there is intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are taking advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our IPO (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in 

16



non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Human Capital
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they each deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will each devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
Our units, shares, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. You can read our SEC filings over the internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or on the Company’s website at www.gardinerhealthcare.com/.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
