Item 1.     Business 
Overview
 
Incorporated in Delaware in 1989, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ethan Allen Global, Inc., and Ethan Allen Global, Inc.’s subsidiaries (collectively, "We," "Us," "Our," "Ethan Allen" or the "Company"), is a leading interior design company and manufacturer and retailer of quality home furnishings. Founded in 1932, today we are a leading international home fashion brand doing business in North America, Asia, the Middle East and Europe. We are vertically integrated from design through delivery, affording our clientele a value proposition of style, quality and price. We offer complimentary interior design service to our clients and sell a full range of furniture products and decorative accents through ethanallen.com and a retail network of approximately 300 design centers in the United States and abroad. The design centers represent a mix of independent licensees and our own Company operated retail segment. We own and operate nine manufacturing facilities including six manufacturing plants and one sawmill in the United States and one manufacturing plant in Mexico and one in Honduras. Approximately 75% of the products sold by the Company are manufactured in our North American plants.

Operating Segments 
 
Our wholesale and retail operating segments represent strategic business areas of our vertically integrated enterprise that operate separately and provide their own distinctive services. This vertical structure enables us to offer our complete line of home furnishings and accents more effectively while controlling quality and cost. We evaluate performance of the respective segments based upon revenues and operating income. Inter-segment transactions result, primarily, from the wholesale sale of inventory to the retail segment, including the related profit margin. For certain financial information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference.
 
As of June 30, 2017, the Company operated 148 design centers (our retail segment) and our independent retailers operated 155 design centers. Our wholesale segment net sales include sales to our retail segment, which are eliminated in consolidation, and sales to our independent retailers. Our retail segment net sales accounted for 79% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017. Our wholesale segment net sales to independent retailers accounted for 21%, including approximately 11.9% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017 to ten of our largest independent retailers, operating 101 design centers. 
 
Wholesale Segment Overview:
 
The wholesale segment, principally involved in the development of the Ethan Allen brand, encompasses all aspects of design, manufacture, sourcing, marketing, sale, and distribution of our broad range of home furnishings and accents. Wholesale revenue is generated upon the sale and shipment of our products to our retail network of independently operated design centers and Company operated design centers.
 
Within the wholesale segment, we maintain revenue information according to each respective product line (i.e. case goods, upholstery, and home accents and other). Case goods include items such as beds, dressers, armoires, tables, chairs, buffets, entertainment units, home office furniture, and wooden accents. Upholstery items include sleepers, recliners and other motion furniture, chairs, ottomans, custom pillows, sofas, loveseats, cut fabrics and leather. Skilled artisans cut, sew and upholster custom-designed upholstery items which are available in a variety of frame, fabric and trim options. Home accent and other items include window treatments and drapery hardware, wall decor, florals, lighting, clocks, mattresses, bedspreads, throws, pillows, decorative accents, area rugs, wall coverings and home and garden furnishings.

Wholesale net sales for each of the last three fiscal years, allocated by product line, were as follows:
 

 | Fiscal Year Ended June 30, | 
-----------------------+----------------------------+----
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
Case Goods | | 33 | % | | 32 | % | 34 | %
Upholstered Products | | 51 | % | | 51 | % | 48 | %
Home Accents and Other | | 16 | % | | 17 | % | 18 | %
 | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
We offer a mix of custom made-to-order and in-stock product programs. Our wholesale backlogs as of June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, were approximately $47.4 million and $40.3 million respectively. Because the size of our backlog at a given time may not be indicative of our future revenues, we do not rely entirely on backlogs to predict future revenues. 
 
Our independent retailers are required to enter into license agreements with us, which (i) authorize the use of certain Ethan Allen trademarks and (ii) require adherence to certain standards of operation, including a requirement to fulfill related warranty service agreements. We are not subject to any territorial or exclusive retailer agreements in North America. 
 
Wholesale profitability includes (i) the wholesale gross margin, which represents the difference between the wholesale net sales price and the cost associated with manufacturing and/or sourcing the related product, and (ii) other operating costs associated with wholesale segment activities. 
 
Retail Segment Overview:
 
The retail segment sells home furnishings and accents to consumers through a network of Company operated design centers. Retail revenue is generated upon the retail sale and delivery of our products to our retail customers through our network of service centers. Retail profitability reflects (i) the retail gross margin, which represents the difference between the retail net sales price and the cost of goods, purchased primarily from the wholesale segment, and (ii) other operating costs associated with retail segment activities.
 
We measure the performance of our design centers based on net sales and written orders booked on a comparable period basis. Comparable design centers are those which have been operating for at least 15 months, including relocated design centers provided the original and relocated design center location had been operating for at least 15 months on a combined basis. During the first three months of operations of newly opened design centers, written orders are booked but minimal net sales are achieved through the delivery of products. Design centers we acquire from independent retailers are included in comparable design center sales in their 13th full month of Ethan Allen-owned operations. The frequency of our promotional events as well as the timing of the end of those events can also affect the comparability of orders booked during a given period. During fiscal 2017, we opened six new design centers, two of which were relocations. The geographic distribution of retail design center locations is included under Item 2 of Part I of this Annual Report.
 
Retail net sales for each of the last three fiscal years, allocated by product line, were as follows:
 

 | Fiscal Year Ended June 30, | 
-----------------------+----------------------------+----
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
Case Goods | | 30 | % | | 31 | % | 32 | %
Upholstered Products | | 48 | % | | 47 | % | 45 | %
Home Accents and Other | | 22 | % | | 22 | % | 23 | %
 | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Products

 Our strategy has been to position Ethan Allen as a preferred brand offering complimentary design service together with products of superior style, quality and value to provide consumers with a comprehensive, one-stop shopping solution for their home furnishing and interior design needs. In carrying out our strategy, we continue to expand our reach to a broader consumer base through a diverse selection of attractively priced products, designed to complement one another, reflecting current fashion trends in home decorating. One such example of this strategy is our new Ethan Allen | Disney product program, launched during fiscal 2017. We continuously monitor changes in home fashion trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal market research, and regular communication with our retailers and design center design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer trends. We believe that the observations and input gathered enable us to incorporate appropriate style details into our products to react quickly to changing consumer tastes.

75% of our furniture is built by artisans, one piece at a time, in our North American workshops. Most frames are hand-assembled and stitching is guided by hand. We select international partners who are as committed to quality as we are. All case good frames are made with premium lumber and veneers. We use best-in-class construction techniques, including mortise and tenon joinery and four-corner glued dovetail joinery on drawers. We combine technology with personal service and maintain an up-to-date broad range of styles and custom options in keeping with today’s home decorating trends. These factors continue to define Ethan Allen, positioning us as a fashion leader in the home furnishing industry. 
 
The interior of our design centers, which were substantially refreshed during the past two fiscal years, are organized to facilitate display of our product offerings, both in room settings that project the category lifestyle and by product grouping to facilitate comparisons of the styles and tastes of our clients. To further enhance the experience, technology is used to expand the range of products viewed by including content from our website in applications used on large touch-screen flat panel displays.
 
Product Development and Sourcing Activities
 
Using a combination of on staff and outsourced product designers, we design the majority of the products we sell. All of our products are branded Ethan Allen. This important facet of our vertically integrated business enables us to control the design specifications and establish consistent levels of quality across the products in our own North American plants. We source approximately 25% of the products we sell from third-party suppliers, most of which are located outside the United States, primarily in Asia. We carefully select our sourcing partners and require them to provide products according to our specifications and quality standards. We believe that strategic investments in our manufacturing facilities balanced with outsourcing from foreign and domestic suppliers will accommodate significant future sales growth and allow us to maintain an appropriate degree of control over cost, quality and service to our customers. 
Environmental Sustainability and Social Responsibility 
 
We are focused on environmental and social responsibility and incorporating uniform social, environmental, health and safety programs into our manufacturing standards. 
 
Our “green” initiatives include but are not limited to the use of responsibly harvested Appalachian woods, water based finishes and measuring our carbon footprint, greenhouse gases and recycled materials from our operations. We have implemented the Enhancing Furniture’s Environmental Culture (EFEC) environmental management system sponsored by the American Home Furnishing Alliance (AHFA) at all our domestic manufacturing, distribution and service center facilities, and have expanded these efforts to our retail design centers, which have now been registered in EFEC. Our Mexico and Honduras facilities have been audited and are registered under the AHFA's EFEC program. Our domestic manufacturing, distribution and service centers have also achieved Sustainable by Design (SBD) registration status under the EFEC program. SBD provides a framework for home furnishings companies to create and maintain a corporate culture of conservation and environmental stewardship by integrating socio-economic policies and sustainable business practices into their manufacturing operations and sourcing strategies.
 
The Company requires its sourcing facilities that manufacture Ethan Allen branded products to implement a labor compliance program and meet or exceed the standards established for preventing child labor, involuntary labor, coercion & harassment, discrimination, and restrictions to freedom of association. These facilities must also provide a safe and healthy environment in all workspaces, compliance with all local wage and hour laws and regulations, compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and they must authorize Ethan Allen and/or its designated agents (including third-party auditing companies) to engage in monitoring activities to confirm compliance.
 
Raw Materials and Other Suppliers 
 
The most important raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing are lumber, veneers, plywood, hardware, glue, finishing materials, glass, laminates, fabrics, foam, and filling material. The various types of wood used in our products include cherry, ash, oak, maple, prima vera, African mahogany, birch, rubber wood and poplar. 
 
Fabrics and other raw materials are purchased both domestically and outside the United States. We have no significant long-term supply contracts, and have sufficient alternate sources of supply to prevent disruption in supplying our operations. We maintain a number of sources for our raw materials, which we believe contribute to our ability to obtain competitive pricing. Lumber prices and availability fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand. The cost of some of our raw materials such as foam and shipping costs are dependent on petroleum cost. Higher material prices, cost of petroleum, and costs of sourced products could have an adverse effect on margins.

ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 
Appropriate amounts of lumber and fabric inventory are typically stocked to maintain adequate production levels. We believe that our sources of supply for these materials are sufficient and that we are not dependent on any one supplier. 
 
We enter into standard purchase agreements with certain foreign and domestic suppliers to source selected products. The terms of these arrangements are customary for the industry and do not contain any long-term contractual obligations on our behalf. We believe we maintain good relationships with our suppliers.
 
Distribution and Logistics
 
We distribute our products through three distribution centers, owned by the Company, strategically located in New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Virginia. These distribution centers provide efficient cross-dock operations to receive and ship product from our manufacturing facilities and third-party suppliers to our retail network of Company and independently operated retail service centers. Retail service centers prepare products for delivery into clients’ homes. At June 30, 2017, the Company operated retail design centers were supported by 14 Company operated retail service centers and 15 service centers operated by third parties. 
 
While we manufacture to custom order the majority of our products, we also stock selected case goods, upholstery and home accents to provide for quick delivery of in-stock items and to allow for more efficient production runs. Wholesale shipments utilize our own fleet of trucks and trailers or are subcontracted with independent carriers. Our fleet of trucks are financed under capital lease agreements with remaining terms ranging from less than two to over three years, and all of our trailers are owned.
 
Our practice has been to sell our products at the same delivered cost to all Company and independently operated design centers in North America, regardless of their shipping point. This policy creates pricing credibility with our wholesale customers while providing our retail segment the opportunity to achieve more consistent margins by removing fluctuations attributable to the cost of shipping. Further, this policy eliminates the need for our independent retailers to carry significant amounts of inventory in their own warehouses. As a result, we obtain more accurate consumer product demand information.
 
Marketing Programs
 
Our multifaceted, multichannel marketing and advertising strategies drive traffic both to design centers and our digital mediums. We believe these efforts give us a strong competitive advantage in the home furnishings industry while benefiting our worldwide retail network of approximately 300 design centers as well as the independent members of our Interior Design Affiliate program.
 
Our team of advertising specialists works to position Ethan Allen as an authority on design, a leader in exemplary service, and a source of style for everyone. In our marketing campaigns, we capitalize on Ethan Allen's strong brand equity, finding creative and compelling ways to promote our tremendous range of products, services, special programs, and custom options. We deliver these messages in a variety of ways – locally, nationally, and globally – to connect and engage with our target audience and drive sales. 
 
As digital channels have taken on increasing importance, we continue to expand our digital marketing reach – supplementing traditional advertising strategies. Our channels include digital and social media, national and local television, direct mail, national and local newspapers, local and satellite radio, and local shelter magazines. Additionally, our robust email marketing program delivers inspiration, sales messages, design solutions, and product information to an ever-expanding database of current and potential clients.
 
Our direct mail magazine, which emphasizes the breadth of our products and services, is one of Ethan Allen's key marketing tools. We produce these magazines multiple times a year; in fiscal 2017, we distributed approximately 21 million copies. We distribute them to targeted marketing segments based on data collected internally and through independent market research. We continually refine our direct mail marketing lists to target clients and potential clients who are most likely to purchase, which provides better returns on direct mail expenditures. 
 
Our websites – ethanallen.com, ethanallen.ca, ethanallen.com/disney, and ethanallen.ca/disney – undergo continuous conversion optimization to boost sales as clients shop, design, and purchase. We also have a web presence to support our international licensees – in some cases, using local languages; in all cases, linking back to ethanallen.com. These websites position Ethan Allen in a manner consistent with our brand yet specific to the region.

A robust and informative Extranet connects our retail network, keeping the lines of communication open among our retailers, design professionals, merchandisers, trainers, and corporate personnel. Information about every aspect of Ethan Allen's retail business is shared here, including advertising materials, prototype floor plan displays, and extensive product details.
Retail Design Centers
 
Ethan Allen design centers are typically located in busy retail settings as freestanding destinations or as part of town centers, lifestyle centers, suburban strip malls or shopping malls, depending upon the real estate opportunities in a particular market. Our design centers average approximately 15,000 square feet in size with 76% between 15,000 and 25,000 square feet and 20% less than 15,000 square feet and 4% greater than 25,000 square feet.
 
Combining technology with personal service in our design centers has allowed us to reduce the size of our design centers. As of June 30, 2017 we operated 19 design centers that have opened in the past three years, and these average 8,700 square feet. These smaller footprint design centers reflect our direction as we move forward in repositioning our retail design centers. These new and relocated design centers also reflect our shift from destination and shopping mall locations to lifestyle centers that better project our brand and offer increased traffic opportunities.
 
We strive to maintain consistency of presentation throughout our retail design centers through a comprehensive set of standards and display planning assistance. These interior display design standards assist each design center in presenting a high quality image by using focused lifestyle settings and select product category groupings to display our products and information to facilitate design solutions and to educate consumers. We also create a consistent brand projection through our exterior facades and signage. The establishment of these standards has helped position Ethan Allen as a leader in the home furnishings industry.
 
We continue to strengthen the Ethen Allen brand with many initiatives, including the opening of new and relocating design centers in desirable locations, updating presentations and floor plans, strengthening of the professionalism of our designers through training and certification, and the consolidation of certain design centers and service centers. 
 
People
 
At June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the Company, through its subsidiaries, had approximately 5,200 employees. The majority of our employees are employed on a fulltime basis and we believe we maintain good relationships with our employees, none of whom are represented by unions.
Customer Service Offerings
 
We offer numerous customer service programs, each of which has been developed and introduced to consumers in an effort to make their shopping experience easier and more enjoyable.
Gift Card 
 
This program allows customers to purchase and redeem gift cards through our website or at any participating retail design center, which can be used for any of our products or services. 
Ethan Allen Consumer Credit Programs
 
The Ethan Allen Platinum program offers consumers (clients) a menu of custom financing options. Financing offered through this program is administered by a third-party financial institution and is granted to our customers on a non-recourse basis to the Company. Clients may apply for an Ethan Allen Platinum card at any participating design center or on-line at ethanallen.com.
Competition
 
The domestic and global home furnishings industry faces numerous challenges, which include an influx of low-priced products from overseas. As a result, there is a high degree of competition in our markets. We differentiate ourselves as a preferred brand by adhering to a business strategy focused on providing (i) high-quality, well designed and often custom, handmade products at good value, (ii) a comprehensive complement of home furnishing design solutions, including our complimentary design service, and (iii) excellence in customer service. We consider our vertical integration a significant competitive advantage in the current environment as it allows us to design, manufacture and source, distribute, market, and sell our products through one of the industry’s largest single-source retail networks.

 The internet also provides a highly competitive medium for the sale of a significant amount of home furnishings each year, and we believe it is becoming increasingly important. Although much of that product is sold through commodity oriented, low priced and low service retailers, we believe consumers are spending more time window shopping on the internet and are thus better informed when they do visit our brick and mortar facilities. At Ethan Allen, the ultimate goal of our internet strategy is to drive traffic into our design centers by combining technology with excellent personal service. Through our digital mediums, customers have the opportunity to buy our products online but we take the process further. With so much of our product offering being custom, we encourage our website customers to get help from our interior design professionals. Consumers also have the ability to immediately chat on-line with one of our qualified design consultants. This complimentary direct contact with one of our knowledgable interior designers creates a competitive advantage through our excellent personal service. This enhances the online experience and regularly leads to internet customers becoming clients of our network of interior design centers. 

Industry globalization has provided us an opportunity to adhere to a blended sourcing strategy, establishing relationships with certain manufacturers, both domestically and outside the United States, to source selected case goods, upholstery, and home accent items. We intend to continue to balance our own North American production with opportunities to source from foreign and domestic manufacturers, as appropriate, in order to maintain our competitive advantage.
 
We believe the home furnishings industry competes primarily on the basis of product styling and quality, personal service, prompt delivery, product availability and price. We further believe that we effectively compete on the basis of each of these factors and that, more specifically, our direct manufacturing, product presentations, website, and complimentary design service create a distinct competitive advantage, further supporting our mission of providing consumers with a complete home decorating and design solution. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves further with the quality of our design service through our intensive training. Our objective is to continue to develop and strengthen our retail network by (i) expanding the Company operated retail business through the repositioning of and opening of new design centers, (ii) obtaining and retaining independent retailers, encouraging such retailers to expand their business through the opening or relocation of new design centers with the objective of increasing the volume of their sales, (iii) further expanding our sales network through our IDA and realtor referral programs and (iv) further expanding our ecommerce. 
 
Trademarks 
 
We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks, service marks and copyrights for the Ethan Allen name, logos and designs in a broad range of classes for both products and services in the United States and in many foreign countries. In addition, we have registered, or have applications pending for certain of our slogans utilized in connection with promoting brand awareness, retail sales and other services and certain collection names. We view such trademarks and service marks as valuable assets and have an ongoing program to diligently monitor and defend, through appropriate action, against their unauthorized use.
