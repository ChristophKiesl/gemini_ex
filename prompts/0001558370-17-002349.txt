     Item 1.  Business
     Overview
     We are a leading provider of high-performance modular memory subsystems serving customers in diverse industries that require superior memory performance to empower critical business decisions. We have a long history of introducing disruptive new products, such as one of the first load reduced dual in-line memory modules ("LRDIMM") based on our distributed buffer architecture, which has been adopted by the industry for DDR4 LRDIMM. We were also one of the first to bring NAND flash memory ("NAND flash") to the memory channel with our NVvault non-volatile dual in-line memory modules ("NVDIMM") using software-intensive controllers and merging dynamic random access memory integrated circuits (“DRAM ICs” or "DRAM") and NAND flash to solve data bottleneck and data retention challenges encountered in high-performance computing environments. We recently introduced a new generation of storage class memory products called HybriDIMM to address the growing need for real-time analytics in Big Data applications and in-memory databases. 
     Due to the ground-breaking product development of our engineering teams, we have built a robust portfolio of over 100 issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents, many seminal, in the areas of hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication and load reduction. Since our inception in 2000, we have dedicated substantial resources to the development and protection of technology innovations essential to our business. Our early pioneering work in these areas has been broadly adopted in industry-standard LRDIMM and in NVDIMM. Our objective is to continue to innovate in our field and invest further in our intellectual property portfolio, with the goal of monetizing our intellectual property through a combination of product sales and licensing, royalty or other revenue-producing arrangements, which may result from defense of our patents through enforcement actions against parties we believe are infringing them. These arrangements can be structured in a variety of ways, including one-time paid-up fees or ongoing royalty arrangements. We aim to generate a portion of our revenues with this type of arrangement in the future, while continuing to pursue revenue growth from sales of our products.
     In November 2015, we entered into a joint development and license agreement (“JDLA”) with Samsung pursuant to which we and Samsung have agreed to work together to jointly develop new storage class memory technologies including a standardized product interface for NVDIMM-P memory modules in order to facilitate broad industry adoption of this new technology. The JDLA also includes comprehensive cross-licenses to our and Samsung’s patent portfolios for the purpose of developing these new technologies, grants Samsung a right of first refusal to acquire our HybriDIMM technology before we offer the technology to a third party and grants us access to competitively priced DRAM and NAND flash raw materials. The JDLA also provided for a non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) fee that we received from Samsung for the joint development and calls for potential marketing collaboration and for the exchange of potential monetary consideration as progress is made towards commercialization of our storage class memory product. Moreover, we believe Samsung represents an important strategic partner with a high level of technical capability in memory that can facilitate bringing our HybriDIMM technology to market.
     Further, in September 2016, we took action to protect and defend our innovations by filing legal proceedings for patent infringement against SK hynix and two of its subsidiaries in the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") and in district court. We are seeking an exclusion order in the ITC that directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to stop allegedly infringing SK hynix RDIMM and LRDIMM products from entering the United States. The evidentiary hearing in the ITC investigations will occur in May 2017, with a final initial determination expected to be issued by the ITC in October 2017. In the district court proceedings, we are primarily seeking damages. Our patents involved in the proceedings cover key features of RDIMM and LRDIMM, which we believe are strategic product lines for SK hynix that together account for a significant portion of SK hynix's total revenue and profits.
     Our Industry
     The global high-performance memory module market is driven by increasing demand from data center and enterprise storage applications for improved input/output (I/O) performance, lower latency and data retention capabilities

in the event of unexpected system failure. Global data center IP traffic is expected to reach 40 zettabytes of data in 2020, corresponding to 40 billion terabyte storage drives of data, up from 3.4 zettabytes in 2014. The proliferation of mobile devices, social media platforms and cloud-based software applications is resulting in the creation of unprecedented amounts of unstructured data. In order to manage and analyze this data, new computing and memory architectures are not satisfying the needs in the industry. 
     In high-performance computing environments, such as cloud-based computing and Big Data applications, a system's overall processing speed is limited to the central processing unit's ("CPU") ability to access data cached in memory. Memory speeds have failed to keep pace with improvements in CPU processing speeds, resulting in buffering delays encountered in highly intensive computing environments. To mitigate challenges arising from differences in CPU and memory clock speeds, data center operators have increased the number of servers in their facilities as well as the memory content in each server. Memory capacity is expanded through the use of DIMMs, generally incorporating up to 16 GB of DRAM per module with today’s technology and moving up to 64 GB of DRAM per module and beyond. Our technology enables an intelligent controller to be integrated onto the DIMM, in order to manage the rapid flow of data between the CPU and memory. The number of DIMMs incorporated into a server increases in correlation with the number of processing cores in the CPU. DDR4 DIMMs incorporate our load-reduction technology to mitigate the trade-off between operating speed and memory capacity inherent in prior generations of server DIMM. These load-reduced DIMMs, or LRDIMMs, are now the pre-dominant memory technology used in high-capacity servers and high-performance computing clusters. 
     Technical challenges arising from the production of DRAM using leading edge semiconductor manufacturing processes is limiting the material's long-term viability as the high-speed memory of choice in demanding computing environments. Conversely, NAND flash, while characterized by lower access speeds, is scaling down in cost and scaling up in density at a significantly better rate than DRAM. This has led the industry to explore alternative computer architectures and new memory materials capable of bridging DRAM's superior access speed with NAND flash's lower cost and higher densities. We expect that memory subsystems relying on intelligent controller technology to leverage NAND flash will most effectively address the industry's growing need for high-speed data management and analytics.
     Products 
    
     Our ability to introduce new or enhanced products that achieve customer or market acceptance in a timely manner has been and we believe will continue to be important factors in developing and maintaining our competitive position. Below are descriptions of our commercially available products and our new products that have been publicly announced, as well as other products that we sell.

     Storage Class Memory
     Using an industry standard DDR4 LRDIMM interface, we believe our HybriDIMM is the industry’s first storage class product capable of operating in existing Intel x86 servers without BIOS and hardware changes.  HybriDIMM unifies DRAM and NAND flash in a plug-and-play module delivering terabyte storage capacities operating at nanosecond memory speeds. HybriDIMM’s architecture combines an on-DIMM co-processor with our PreSight predictive software-defined data management algorithm. HybriDIMM’s feature-set encompasses the NVDIMM functionalities adopted by the industry. HybriDIMM dramatically improves application performance by reducing data access latency by up to 1,000 times versus the fastest existing storage solution and provides up to an 80% cost reduction compared to the highest existing memory density for in-memory applications. We publicly demonstrated a HybriDIMM prototype in August 2016, and we are planning to sample HybriDIMM with customers in the second half of 2017 and subsequently work with customers to transition to volume production.     Nonvolatile Memory
     Our Vault product line enables customers to accelerate data running through their servers and storage and reliably protect enterprise-level cache, metadata and log data by providing near instantaneous recovery in the event of a system failure or power outage.  In 2015, sales of these products represented approximately 20% of our net product sales. Listed below is a summary of our nonvolatile memory offering.
     EXPRESSvault PCIe (EV3). EV3 is a plug-and-play memory card for server appliances which provides data acceleration and data protection.  It is compatible with industry standard PCIe 3.0 x8 lane slots, eliminating the need for proprietary hardware and extra motherboard space.  EXPRESSvault ships with Linux and Windows drivers compatible with standard PCIe peripheral command sets. 
     NVvault DDR3 NVDIMM (NV3). NV3 provides data acceleration and data protection in a Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (“JEDEC”) standard DD3 interface for integration into industry-standard server and storage solutions. NV3 incorporates our patented Vault cache-to-flash controller in conjunction with general purpose CPUs, redundant array of independent disks (“RAID”) adapters and other devices.
     NVvault DDR4 NVDIMM (NV4).  NV4 relies on the NVDIMM-N interface specification to provide data acceleration and data protection in a JEDEC standard DDR4 interface.  We have demonstrated NV4 to deliver a 200% performance improvement in transaction-based workloads compared to PCIe NAND devices. 
     Specialty DIMMs and Embedded Flash
     A portion of our net product sales is from original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) sales of specialty memory modules and flash-based products, the majority of which are utilized in data center and industrial applications.  When developing custom modules for an OEM system launch, we engage with our OEM customers from the earliest stages of new product development definition, providing us valuable insight into their full range of system architecture and performance requirements.  This close collaboration has also allowed us to develop a significant level of systems expertise. We leverage a portfolio of proprietary technologies and design techniques, including efficient planar design, alternative packaging techniques and custom semiconductor logic, to deliver memory subsystems with persistence, high density, small form factor, high signal integrity, attractive thermal characteristics, reduced power consumption and low cost per bit.
     Component and Other Product Resales
     We also resell certain Samsung products that we purchase under the terms of our JDLA with Samsung to certain end-customers that are not reached in Samsung’s distribution model. In 2016, resales of these products represented approximately 21% of our net product sales. Additionally, we sell excess component inventory of DRAM ICs and NAND flash to distributors and other users of memory integrated circuits.

     Technology 
     We have developed our products based on our portfolio of proprietary technologies and design techniques. Below are descriptions of our technology competencies.
     PreSight Technology
    
PreSight technology is, we believe, a breakthrough that allows for data that lives on a slower media, such as NAND flash, to coexist on the memory channel without breaking the deterministic nature of the memory channel. This is achieved by pre-fetching data into DRAM before an application needs it and ensures the memory channel’s integrity is maintained while moving the data on the DIMM. PreSight technology is material and protocol agnostic, allowing for leverage of future storage and memory technologies on the DIMM. Our HybriDIMM incorporates our PreSight technology for predictive memory management.       Distributed Buffer Architecture
    
We invented the distributed buffer architecture that enables the buffering of data signals along the bottom edge of the memory module using multiple data buffer devices distributed between the edge connector and the DRAM. The result is shorter data paths, improved signal integrity and reduced latency compared to the industry-standard design for LRDIMM. Our HyperCloud product was our first load reduced DIMM built on this distributed buffer architecture.     IC Design Expertise
    
We have designed special algorithms that can be implemented in stand-alone integrated circuits or integrated into other functional blocks in application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”). We utilize these algorithms in our HybriDIMM product to incorporate rank multiplication and load reduction functionality. We also incorporate these algorithms in our NVvault product line of RDIMMS.     Proprietary PCB Designs
    
We utilize advanced techniques to optimize electronic signal strength and integrity within a PCB. These techniques include the use of 8-layer or 10-layer boards, matching conductive trace lengths, a minimized number of conductive connectors, or vias, and precise load balancing to, among other benefits, help reduce noise and crosstalk between adjacent traces. In addition, our proprietary designs for the precise placement of intra-substrate components allow us to assemble memory subsystems with significantly smaller physical size, enabling OEMs to develop products with smaller footprints for their customers.     Very Low Profile Designs
    
We believe we were the first company to create memory subsystems in a form factor of less than one inch in height. Our innovative very low profile (“VLP”) DIMMs provide developers of server blades, storage bridge bay applications, telecommunications servers, switches and routers with a wide range of high performance memory options where efficient use of motherboard space is critical. Our technology has allowed us to decrease the system board space required for memory, and improve thermal performance and operating speeds, by enabling our customers to use alternative methods of component layout. Our latest VLP memory product includes a patented PlanarX memory module technology providing 32 gigabyte 4Rx4 memory solutions for dense space requirements.     Thermal Management Designs
    
We design our memory subsystems to ensure effective heat dissipation. We use thermal cameras to obtain thermal profiles of the memory subsystem during the design phase, allowing us to rearrange components to enhance 

 
  6

 
thermal characteristics and, if necessary, replace components that do not meet specifications. We also develop and use proprietary heat spreaders to enhance the thermal management characteristics of our memory subsystems.
     Our Strategy 
     Our objective is to be the leading supplier of storage class memory and other high-performance hybrid memory solutions. Key aspects of our growth strategy include: 
     Invest to Extend Our Intellectual Property Portfolio
     We believe we own the largest portfolio of patents pertaining to high-performance server memory, hybrid memory and storage class memory that have withstood legal challenges. We believe our patent portfolio covers a range of high-volume products in the marketplace today that incorporate and practice our pioneering work in the field of high-performance memory and hybrid memory. We intend to continue investing in our intellectual property portfolio to further establish ourselves as an innovator in the high-performance memory subsystem market and to identify emerging customer requirements for future generations of products. This may include filing additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our technology advancements in order to expand the scope and strengthen the position of our portfolio.     Actively Pursue Intellectual Property Monetization Opportunities
     We intend to vigorously defend our patent portfolio and other intellectual property rights, including, when necessary, through pursuit of enforcement actions seeking injunctive relieve or monetary damages, and aggressively pursue monetization avenues for these rights, including licensing, royalty or other revenue-producing arrangements. We dedicate substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property, including efforts to defend our patents against challenges made by way of reexamination and review proceedings at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”), and we expect these activities to continue for the foreseeable future.     Increase our Net Product Sales from our Base of Hybrid Memory Products
     We intend to drive adoption of our portfolio of nonvolatile memory subsystems, EV3 and NV4, through collaboration with ecosystem partners. 
     Customers
     In 2016, we primarily marketed and sold our products to leading OEMs in the server, high-performance computing and communications markets. Additionally, we resell certain Samsung products that we purchase under the terms of our JDLA with Samsung to certain end-customers that are not reached in Samsung’s distribution model, including storage customers, appliance customers, system builders and cloud and datacenter customers. Consistent with the concentrated nature of the customer base in our target markets, a small number of large customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net product sales.  Net product sales to our largest customer, UATC, LLC, represented approximately 16% of our net product sales in 2016, and Dell and Singh Semiconductor and Systems represented approximately 27% and 10% of our net product sales in 2015, respectively. For further information regarding our customer base, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
     The composition of major customers and their respective contributions to our net product sales have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period as our existing and prospective customers progress through the life cycle of the products they produce and sell.
     We do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers. Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders that we often receive no more than two weeks in advance of the desired delivery date and that may be rescheduled or cancelled on relatively short notice, which reduces our backlog of firm orders and our ability to 

 
  7

 
accurately estimate future customer requirements for our products. Customers are generally allowed limited rights of return for up to 30 days, except for sales of excess inventories, which contain no right-of-return privileges. 
     Additionally, we offer warranties on our memory subsystems generally ranging from one to three years, depending on the product and negotiated terms of purchase agreements with our customers. Such warranties require us to repair or replace defective products returned to us during such warranty period at no cost to the customer. 
     For additional information regarding our net product sales from external customers by geographic area, refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The international scope of our operations, including our sales of products to customers located outside the United States and our manufacturing operations located outside the United States, exposes us to significant risks, such as, for instance, operational integration and currency exchange challenges and uncertainties in the economic and political climate in the countries in which we operate or make sales, including pronounced uncertainties regarding trade restrictions following the results of the recent U.S. presidential election. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for more information.
     Sales and Marketing
     We primarily market and sell our products through a direct sales force and a network of independent sales representatives.  Our sales activities focus primarily on developing strong relationships at the technical, marketing and executive management levels within existing and prospective OEM and ODM customers, large Datacenters and system builder customers. 
     We utilize well-trained, highly technical program management teams to drive new product development and quickly respond to our customers' needs and expectations. Our program management teams provide quick response times and act as a single point-of-contact for issues that may arise during the sales process. Additionally, they help us address the long-term business and technology goals of our customers. We employ a team approach to business development whereby our sales team and independent representatives identify, qualify and prioritize customer prospects through offices in a number of locations worldwide.
     Manufacturing
     We manufacture substantially all of our products at our facility in Suzhou in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). This in-house manufacturing, combined with our advanced engineering and design capabilities, allows us to assemble our memory subsystems reliably and in high volume. Our manufacturing facility is capable of surface mount assembly, subsystem testing, system‑level burn-in testing, programming, marking, labeling and packaging. At each stage of the production cycle, including product prototyping, qualification sample production and high-volume manufacturing and delivery, we focus on providing our customers with rapid response and short manufacturing turn-around times. Manufacturing cycle times for our products, from receipt of order, are typically one week or less and in some cases as short as two days.
    
We acquire components and materials such as field-programmable gate arrays (“FPGAs”), ASICs, DRAM ICs and NAND flash, directly from integrated circuit manufacturers and assemble them into finished subsystems. We have developed strong supplier relationships with several manufacturers of these components, which we believe gives us direct and ready access to the critical components we need for our production activities. Additionally, we typically qualify our products with our customers using multiple component manufacturers, which affords us the flexibility to choose from several suppliers. We believe that this efficient procurement and management of components for our subsystems benefits our customers in the form of lower costs and increased product availability. While we have developed relationships with a number of component suppliers that we could potentially use, our actual purchases of inventory are concentrated in a small number of suppliers, including Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., from which we obtained 73% of our total inventory purchases in 2016, and Arrow Electronics and Barun Electronics, Inc., from which we obtained 14% and 12% of our total inventory purchases in 2015, respectively. Further, our JDLA with Samsung contractually commits Samsung to supply NAND flash and DRAM products to us upon our request at competitive prices. For further information regarding our supplier concentrations, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We schedule production based on purchase order commitments and 

 
  8

 
anticipated orders. We release raw materials to the manufacturing floor by means of an online shop floor control system, which allows for internal quality analysis, direct access to inventory information and production floor material tracking. We have a flexible manufacturing workforce, which allows us to manage unforecasted demand. In addition, in order to mitigate inventory risks, we have the capability to sell excess quantities of certain component inventories of DRAM ICs and NAND flash to distributors and other users of memory integrated circuits.  
     Our quality assurance engineers work with our suppliers to ensure that the raw materials we receive meet our high quality standards. These engineers also perform onsite supplier factory audits and use our internal test and inspection systems to verify that purchased components and materials meet our specifications. Our supplier quality program and incoming material quality control program are important aspects of our overall manufacturing process.
     We perform ongoing reliability testing on our memory subsystems and share the results of that testing with our customers. We believe that this improves the system design process and allows for the elimination of potential problems at an early stage of the manufacturing process. In addition, we have implemented procedures that require all of our memory subsystems to undergo functional and system burn-in testing prior to delivery to a customer. We also supplement our test capabilities with advanced imaging technology to inspect the quality of our assemblies.
     Our manufacturing facility is certified in International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 9001:2008 Quality Management Systems and ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management Standards.
     Competition 
     Our products are primarily targeted to OEMs in the server, high-performance computing and data storage markets. These markets are intensely competitive, as numerous companies vie for business opportunities at a limited number of large OEMs and other customers. We face competition from DRAM suppliers, memory module providers and logic suppliers for many of our products, including EXPRESSvault, NVvault and HybriDIMM. Additionally, if and to the extent we enter new markets or pursue licensing arrangements to monetize our technologies and intellectual property portfolio, we may face competition from a large number of competitors that produce solutions utilizing similar or competing technologies.
     Some of our customers and suppliers may have proprietary products or technologies that are competitive with our products, or could develop internal solutions or enter into strategic relationships with, or acquire, other high-density memory module providers. Any of these actions could reduce our customers’ demand for our products. Some of our significant suppliers of memory integrated circuits may be able to manufacture competitive products at lower costs by leveraging internal efficiencies, or could choose to reduce our supply of memory integrated circuits, which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our memory subsystems on a timely basis, if at all.
     Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, broader product lines, lower cost structures, greater brand recognition and longer standing relationships with customers and suppliers. Some of our competitors may also have a greater ability to influence industry standards than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors may have more extensive or established patent portfolios than we do. We may not be able to compete effectively against any of these organizations.
     We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and potentially reduce their prices. In addition, our competitors may develop future generations and enhancements of competitive products or new or enhanced technologies that may offer greater performance and improved pricing or render our technologies obsolete. Our ability to compete in our current target markets and potential future markets will depend in large part on our ability to successfully develop, introduce and sell new and enhanced products or technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis and to respond to changing market requirements. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the selection of high-performance memory subsystems by existing and potential future customers are:
    
· | price;
--+-------

· | timeliness of new value-add product introductions;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | development of advanced technologies;
--+--------------------------------------


· | fulfillment capability and flexibility;
--+----------------------------------------


· | understanding of OEM system and business requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | design characteristics and performance;
--+----------------------------------------


· | quality and reliability;
--+-------------------------


· | track record of volume delivery; and
--+-------------------------------------


· | credibility with the customer
--+------------------------------

      We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. However, if our target markets disagree or if circumstances changes with respect to one or more of these competitive factors, our market position and prospectus could deteriorate and our revenues could decline.
     Research and Development
     Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and rapid product obsolescence. As a result, continuous development of new technology, processes and product innovation is necessary in order to be successful. We believe that the continued and timely development of new products and improvement of existing products are critical to our business and prospects for growth.
     To this end, we have assembled a team of engineers with expertise in computer architectures, system memory, subsystem design and memory software, as well as PCB design, VLP design and thermal management. Our engineers also focus on developing and incorporating new techniques, methodologies and processes for testing and manufacturing our products.
     Our engineers closely engage with our customers and their engineering teams at early stages in their systems development and new product definition. This collaboration provides us with valuable insight into the customer’s system architecture, power budget, performance requirements, operating environment (such as air flow and operating temperature) and any mechanical constraints. Our engineers use this information to provide guidance and solutions to implement optimum memory subsystems. This close collaboration has also allowed us to develop a significant level of systems expertise. An important aspect of our research and development effort is to understand the challenges faced by our customers and provide cost -effective solutions that satisfy their requirements by utilizing our industry knowledge, proprietary technologies and technical expertise.
     In our product development, we use advanced design tools that allow us to model behavior of a signal trace on our memory modules as well as airflow and thermal profiles of all components in the system. These design tools enable real-time simulation for signal integrity and behavioral modeling of our designs using the same models as our component suppliers. These simulation tools help us reduce or eliminate electronic signal reflections, clock skews, signal jitter and noise, which can reduce system performance and reliability, which allows us to develop optimum solutions for our customers.
     In our product development efforts, we have designed and developed custom semiconductor logic devices. These logic devices are integrated into our next-generation memory subsystems in order to improve their performance. Logic devices in our NVvault and EXPRESSvault hybrid memory products enable DRAM and NAND flash memory to be efficiently combined for the purposes of accelerating system performance and providing mission -critical back-up. The development of these semiconductor devices is an important part of our overall product development efforts.
    
 
  10

 

 We have invested significant resources in our product development efforts. Our customers typically do not separately compensate us for design and engineering work involved in developing application‑specific products for them. Our total expenditures for research and development were approximately $6.3 million and $6.0 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
     Intellectual Property Rights
     Our high-performance memory subsystems are developed in part using our proprietary technologies, and we believe that the strength of our intellectual property rights will be important to the success of our business. We utilize patent and trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements with customers and partners, disclosure and invention assignment agreements with employees and consultants and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information. As of December 31, 2016, we had 66 U.S. and foreign patents issued and 42 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Assuming that they are properly maintained, our patents will expire at various dates between 2022 and 2035. Our issued patents and patent applications relate to the use of custom logic in high-performance memory subsystems, PCB design, layout and packaging techniques. Our patents cover different aspects of our technology innovations and various claim scopes and, as such, we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon any one claim in any of our existing patents or pending patent applications.     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 95 employees (including 78 full-time employees and 17 temporary employees). Of these employees, 38 were located in the United States and 40 were located in the PRC and the Republic of Korea. We had 52 employees in operations, 25 employees in research and development, 11 employees in sales and marketing, and 7 employees engaged in other administrative functions. In addition to our employees, a significant portion of our workforce consists of contract personnel. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements with any of our employees. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe our employee relations are good.     Compliance with Environmental and Other Laws
    
We are subject to various and frequently changing U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. In particular, some of our manufacturing processes may require us to handle and dispose of hazardous materials from time to time. For example, in the past our manufacturing operations have used lead-based solder in the assembly of our products. Today, we use lead-free soldering technologies in our manufacturing processes, as this is required for products entering the European Union. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or noncompliance with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not incurred significant costs to date to comply with these laws and regulations, new laws or changes to current laws and regulations to make them more stringent could require us to incur significant costs to remain in compliance.
     We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to other matters, including workplace health and safety, labor and employment, foreign business practices, public reporting and taxation, among others. It is difficult and costly to manage the requirements of every authority having jurisdiction over our various activities and to comply with their varying standards. Any changes to existing regulations or adoption of new regulations may result in significant additional expense to us and our customers. Further, our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties or imposition of sanctions or other corrective requirements.
