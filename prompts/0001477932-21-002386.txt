Item 1. Business
 
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Report”), references to the “Company,” the “registrant,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer to Cool Technologies, Inc. and our 95% owned subsidiary, Ultimate Power Truck, LLC (“UPT”), unless the context otherwise indicates.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on July 22, 2002 in the State of Nevada under the name Bibb Corporation.
 
On September 3, 2010, we changed our name to Z3 Enterprises, Inc. (“Z3”), and on April 5, 2012, to HPEV, Inc. (“HPEV”) and on August 19, 2015 our stockholders voted to approve a name change to Cool Technologies, Inc. Our 95% owned subsidiary, Ultimate Power Truck, LLC (“UPT”), was formed on April 17, 2014 in the State of Florida.
 
On March 29, 2011, we entered into a share exchange agreement (which was amended on June 14, 2011) with HPEV, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“the Share Exchange Agreement”) to acquire 100 shares, constituting all of the issued and outstanding shares of HPEV, Inc. in consideration for the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of common stock. Upon closing of the share exchange on April 15, 2011, HPEV, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary. There was a change of control of our company on April 15, 2011 as a result of the issuance of 21,880,000 shares of our common stock to the original shareholders of HPEV, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement. An additional 120,000 shares were issued during the fourth quarter of 2011 which completed the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of common stock under the terms of the amended Share Exchange Agreement. 
 
We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 140,000,000 shares to 350,000,000 shares, effective March 22, 2017. We filed a second amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 350,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares, effective October 28, 2019. We filed a third amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 500,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 shares, effective February 13, 2020. 
 
As of April 6, 2021, we have seven US patents, one Canadian patent, two granted patents (1 Mexican, 1 Canadian) and two pending applications (1 in the US, 1 in Brazil) covering composite heat structures, motors, and related structures, heat pipe architecture, and applications (commonly referred to as “thermal” or “heat dispersion technology”). We also have one Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application pending that covers integrated electrical power generation methods and systems.
 
The Company intends to sell a mobile electric power system to government, military and commercial vehicle and fleet owners. It intends to commercialize its patents by licensing its thermal technologies and applications to electric motor, pump and vehicle component manufacturers. It may license its mobile electric power system as well. 
 
Business Description 
 
Cool Technologies has spent years designing and developing its technologies. The core technologies are:
 
Thermal Dispersion – patented technologies (totally enclosed heat pipe cooled and radial vent) that deliver liquid-cooled results for rotating equipment, multi-plate clutches, brakes and rotors without the use of liquid. Liquid cooling is the best, most effective cooling system for electric motors, however, it is also the most expensive. Our technologies reduce the cost of rotating equipment by eliminating the active material and, otherwise, extra components that liquid cooling requires. Our technologies also reduce production costs by increasing the power densities of the rotating equipment which enables them to output the same power from a smaller package. 
 
Mobile Power Generation -- a patented and patents pending in-chassis system that outputs electrical power in amounts equal to or greater than skid-mounted generators or tow-behind generators from a smaller, lighter, more efficient package. 
 
The markets for products utilizing our technology include consumer, industrial and military markets, both in the U.S. and worldwide. Our initial target markets include those involved in moving materials and moving people, such as:
 

· | Motors/Generators, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Mobile auxiliary power, 
· | Water purification and desalination 
· | Electric vehicle charging 
· | Compressors, 
· | Turbines (Wind, Micro), 
· | Bearings, 
· | Electric Vehicles: rail, off-highway, mining, delivery, refuse, 
· | Brakes/rotors/calipers, 
· | Pumps/fans, 
· | Passenger vehicles: autos, RVs, buses, trains, aircraft, 
· | Commercial vehicles: SUV, light trucks, trams, bucket trucks 
· | Military: boats, Humvees, trucks, aircraft, and 
· | Marine: boats ranging in size from 30 feet to 120 feet and beyond.

Our Technologies
 
Our technologies are divided into two distinct but complementary categories: heat dispersion technology and mobile power generation (MG).
 
Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe and Radial Vent Heat Pipe
 
The Company has developed, designed, prototyped and third party tested Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled (TEHPC) designs. It also owns the patents on the designs. The designs apply to dry pit submersible motors and 
 650 kVA marine duty generators. 
 
Our patent portfolio covers the application and integration of our heat pipes into various other cooling schemes for enhanced heat removal in motors (i.e. electric motorcycles, cars and trucks), generators (i.e. e-axles and the MG system) and numerous other industrial applications including multi-clutches for vehicles and brakes and rotors for vehicles marine, aviation and military. We believe that our technologies have the potential to deliver power output increases and cost reductions, depending on the machine type or motor/generator size, as follows:
 

1. | Increase power density of current motor platforms by 20% to 40%,
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Reduce total product cost by 12.5% to 25%, 
3. | Increase motor and generator efficiency by 1% to 2%, and 
4. | Increase motor and generator life. 

 
We also believe that products produced with our technologies have the potential to deliver operational savings as well, including savings from:
 

- | reduced maintenance costs, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | the standardization of multiple platforms down to a single platform, 
- | the standardization of drawings and data around existing platforms, 
- | the ability to use standard designs and standard insulation systems versus customization, and 
- | the ability to integrate and produce on existing production lines with no retooling and no additional, or minimal, capital investment.

 
Testing conducted by independent laboratories showed a 200% increase in horsepower capability for a dry pit submersible pump and a 25 to 35% increase in power density for a 650 kVA generator. 
 
In 2019, a new Canadian patent covering a Heat Pipe Cooled Wet Rotating Disc Engagement System and a Radial Vent Composite Heat Pipe was added to the Company’s existing patents. It’s a utility patent which is more difficult to circumvent and, therefore, easier to defend. The designation ‘utility patent’ means that the patent covers the Company’s cooling technologies when used in a wide variety of specific applications as opposed to simply covering the cooling method or technology itself. This is an extremely important distinction with regard to defending patents. These applications include electric vehicle motors, standard electric motors, generators, engine hot spots, pistons, ERG (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) coolers and more. Similar patents are pending in other countries as part of the Global PCT patent process.

Our revenue model for the heat dispersion technology is to license the technology in exchange for royalties. Our design and manufacturing experience will be put to use by taking current product in the market, retrofitting with our TEHPC and radial vent heat pipes and handing back to the OEM a third party tested and validated, manufacturable product that increases performance and lowers cost. 
 
The electric motorcycle industry which includes brands such as Harley Davidson, Zero and others, relies on both air- cooled and liquid-cooled motors. We believe our technology can result in the production of smaller, lighter weight motors as well as cooler motors, batteries and controls. We believe it will also address common performance issues such as overheating which shuts down the motor and forces the rider to stop and let the motor cool. Finally, we believe our wet rotating disc engagement system can cool motorcycle clutches and brakes.
 

Thermal Technology Target Markets: Generators
---------------------------------------------
Large kilowatt: | prime power 
Stationary: | emergency back-up, UPS systems 
Commercial Mobile: | Electric vehicles and motor- cycles, e-axles, battery management systems
Consumer: | home standby, recreation 
Rental: | mobile + light towers, pumps, compressors 

Mobile Power Generation (MG)
 
The Company’s mobile power generation system enables work trucks to power an in-chassis generator, eliminating the need for some commercial vehicles to tow a mobile generator to a work site. Management believes that there is an unmet demand for on-board, continuous generation of up to 350 to 400 kilowatts (kW) of power to remote jobsites, charge electric vehicles and generate emergency power in the event of an outage or disaster. Recent meetings with Mexican farmers, military personnel and electric vehicle companies along with feedback from international representatives and agents of the Company have confirmed the need for such applications. We offer an in-chassis generator installation kit as a stand-alone (Mobile Generator or MG) for third parties and have contracted with Craftsmen Industries to perform domestic installations. It’s likely the Company will also contract with a facility overseas to handle the foreign orders it has received. 
 
Management, along with key directors and members of the Board of Advisors, utilized 2020 to increase MG output up to 400 kVA and add or enhance optional capabilities. Despite the fact that COVID 19 eliminated face to face meetings, they also managed to build vendor relationships, expand existing business relationships and establish new ones in Mexico, the Middle East, Africa and the USA, specifically the US Army and the mining industry.
 
The Company has signed international joint ventures in Turkey (Belirti Teknoloji) and Australia (KeyOptions) as well as a strategic alliance with VerdeWatts and FirmGreen. Belirti Teknoloji will market and sell CoolTech’s entire product platform in Southern Europe, the Middle East and some North African nations. KeyOptions will market and sell CoolTech’s entire product platform in Australia and neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.
 
The Company has also signed an independent agent agreement with H&K Ventures to generate investment funding and revenues from its business relationships in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the US.
 
Our joint venture with Belirti Teknoloji (a multi-national, multibillion-dollar engineering firm) has produced a non-contingent purchase order for six hundred MG80, MG125 and MG200 Mobile Generation systems.

As the Company is still pre-revenue, some production funding may be made in conjunction with projects that involve our director Steve Wilburn’s companies’ FirmGreen or VerdeWatts. In the meantime, CoolTech has continued to pursue non-dilutive financing based upon the third party valuation of the Company’s intellectual property, however, there can be no assurance that financing will be obtained.
 
As a result of a cross marketing and license agreement the Company signed with FirmGreen (a producer of commercial water systems) and the interest we received from Mexican government officials, we are commercializing our water desalination and purification capability. The Company now offers MG125 water purification and desalination systems capable of producing up to 14,000 gallons of potable water per day as well as delivery if a rolling tank is hitched to the truck. The truck-mounted systems should cleanse contaminated, polluted and wastewater or remove saline from saltwater. The desalination unit should output either clean potable water for drinking and cooking or non-potable water for agricultural or mining use. 
 
In July 2019, our CEO attended a meeting with senators, federal, local, and Oaxaca state deputies, as well as representatives of state and federal agencies in Villa Alta, Mexico to discuss ways to clean the water in the Atoyac River, which is considered to be one of the most polluted rivers in Mexico. 
 
Since then elected officials in the states of Jalisco, Hidalgo and Sonora have also expressed interest in using the MG to treat water from their rivers. The need in Hidalgo is especially urgent. Over 100,000 people were infected with the coronavirus in 2020 due to the contamination of their drinking water. For most states, the primary contaminant is sewage. In Sonora, it’s salt. Both impact drinking water and irrigation.
 
We expect the license agreement signed with VerdeWatts (a solar panel and energy storage manufacturer) will also act as a catalyst in the development of a no-idle option that will enable the MG system to operate solely through battery and solar power without the need to idle the truck’s engine. An MG outfitted with a solar or battery-powered no idle system could output clean drinkable water for virtually no cost. 
 
Mexican interest extends beyond immediate applications. Federal Deputy Efrain Rocha Vega announced in 2020, the Mexican government will also support a Cool Technologies Center of Excellence to help integrate CoolTech’s green energy platform into other areas of the Mexican economy. A Center of Excellence is a shared facility or entity that provides leadership, best practices, research, support and/or training for our MG power systems, our mobile water purification and desalination systems and possibly our solar-powered and no-idle technology
 
The joint venture the Company signed with VerdeWatts and FirmGreen added a new application for the MG System: making it an integral part of mobile microgrids. VerdeWatts solar panels and battery storage systems would provide the sustainable energy. MG Systems would recharge or back-up the microgrids and simultaneously power FirmGreen water purification and desalination systems. 
 
The mobile microgrids would interface with existing infrastructure for power, water, wireless communications and healthcare. They would provide or increase resilience during grid outages such as what occurred this past winter in Texas, using clean energy alternatives to mobile fossil fuel generators. The microgrids could also power, light and provide potable water and irrigation for farming villages throughout rural America and the developing world. VerdeWatts has publicly stated it has microgrid projects in Puerto Rico, Chile and Nigeria and that it intends to build mobile medical clinics and emergency command posts powered by MG systems.
 
An application that the Company has demonstrated publicly is truck mounted electric vehicle charging. Mobile charging vehicles don’t require permits or build out of infrastructure which, depending on the type of charging required can cost $300,000 to $400,000. (https://electrek.co/2018/10/16/porsche-taycan-dealers-charging-stations/). Our technology can provide Level 2, DC Fast Charging and even mega charging (up to and including 400 kVA on a medium duty Class 6 truck) and should deliver even more power in the future. Because the system is retrofittable, it can be uninstalled and reinstalled on a larger or newer model truck that generates more torque.

Our revenue model for an in-chassis mobile electric power generation system is driven by the efforts of partner up-fitters and truck body builders along with regional sales teams and independent representatives as well as strategic alliances and joint ventures. 
 
We believe that in head-to-head competition with tow behind generators, our mobile generation technology should prove very disruptive. Operators in such markets as the military, utilities and agriculture, to name a few, will be able to work in remote locations without having to tow or drop in a generator. We believe that the reduction in overall weight and size should also deliver significant operating efficiencies and savings to government and work truck fleets. Furthermore, we believe that our new applications will enhance adoption of the MG across an even wider range of industries, NGOs and government entities in both first and third world countries. 
 
Competition 
 
Heat Dispersion Technologies (Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled and Radial Vent Heat Pipe) 
 
Cooling solutions to remove or control heat produced by industrial electric motors, generators and alternators are provided by the manufacturers. Their current best practices are based on technology that’s over 50 years old. They either add a liquid cooling system to the motor or build an extra-large frame around the motor to provide additional surface area to help dissipate the heat. Both practices increase the cost and complexity of their products. 
 
The Company is not aware of any new alternatives on the market.
 
Mobile Electric Power (MG30-MG200)

The worldwide market for power generation off site spans a broad range. We believe the competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to:

· | technological innovation and adaptability;
--+-------------------------------------------
· | ease of transport and use; 
· | product quality and safety; 
· | kilowatts output and efficiency; and 
· | product price. 

 
We believe our primary competition in the mobile generator market will be from well-established companies such as Cummins, Caterpillar Inc., Doosan Group, Wacker Neuson SE, Multi Quip Inc. and Generac Power Systems All of them offer towable, trailer-mounted generators. Only Cummins Onan offers an onboard generator, and it is specifically engineered for mobile emergency vehicle use. 
 
Portable generators address a need for mobile electric power in the commercial, leisure and residential markets. As outputs tend to range from 1 to 20 kilowatts (kW), the competition they provide is only at the lowest end of our power output spectrum. Onan, Honda and Kohler are among the well-established brand names. 
 
A standard option that can be ordered when purchasing a truck is a power take-off or PTO. PTOs are mounted to a truck’s drivetrain and redirect engine power to operate onboard equipment. Integrated power systems use the PTO to run an alternating current generator. Cool Tech has the capability to power the generator directly from the drivetrain or from a PTO.
 
Real Power from Contour Hardening, Inc. offers alternating current (AC) power systems driven by a PTO. System voltages range from 10 to 180 kVA. Those under 30 kW retrofit under the beds of class 3 to 5 diesel trucks. Systems larger than 100 kW require Class 6 diesel trucks and a side mount. An important difference between the Real Power and the MG systems is that the MG can generate up to 125 kW on class 3 to 5 trucks and it can operate independently from the transmission.
 

8

 
Modular integrated systems offer varying combinations of air compressors, welders, hydraulics and generators. Vanair Manufacturing, Inc’s Underdeck uses a PTO to power various combinations and output from 6.6 to 25 kilowatts. 
 
HIPPO Multipower packages hydraulic, air, electric and welding into a single unit. Outputs range from 5.2 to 9 kW. The Enpak from Miller Electric Manufacturing Company offers the same package powered by a separate diesel engine that exports 6 kW of power.
 
Many electric vehicles (“EV”) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (“PHEV”) can use excess battery capacity to provide exportable power with no idling. Via Motors retails a plug-in hybrid electric van. The optional power export module provides 14.4 kW. Ford’s 2021 hybrid F-150 pickup truck exports 2.4 to 7.2 kilowatts of power. Odyne Systems, LLC, manufactures hybrid systems for medium and heavy-duty work trucks over 14,000 pounds. The systems export 6 to 18 kW of AC power.
 
Another way EV and PHEV can power onboard equipment is through an ePTO or electric power take-off which is essentially a battery-powered version of a PTO. Terex’s Corporation’s hybrid-electric system uses an ePTO to export up to 3.8 kW of power. Cummins, Inc. PHEV and EV drivetrain systems offer an exportable power option that provides 50 to 200 kW of grid-synchronized power. The drive system made by First Priority Greenfleet exports up to 120 kW of synchronized power. 
 
Allison Transmission and a partner company combine a generator and transmission into a single casing to produce 30 to 125 kW of electric power. 
 
While both the MG and the Allison Transmission are retrofittable, there are important differences. The Allison is limited to new vehicles that incorporate its 3,000 and 4,000 Series transmissions. The MG can produce up to 125 kW on an 8,000 pound as opposed to a 40,000-pound vehicle. Also, the MG’s power is produced independently from the transmission, consequently, the truck can still operate if the generator stops working. 
 
Other companies use a vehicle’s engine to charge on-board batteries, which then run the generator when the vehicle is stopped. Output tends to be less than 50 kW and lithium-ion batteries typically power the system. The batteries have limited runtimes and a shorter lifespan than acid batteries. In addition, they must be cooled to operate properly. Altec Inc. Jobsite Energy Management System provides up to 4 kW of exportable power.
 
Aura Systems, Inc. and Mobile Electric Power Solutions, Inc. (“MEPS”) use a vehicle engine’s drive belt to turn a generator. MEPS provides up to 15 kW of AC power whereas Aura Systems generates up to 20 kW of direct current (DC) or AC power. Other MEPS engine or transmission-based electrical power take-off systems output small amounts in the range of 7 kW or 15 kW when two generators are aligned. 
 
CoolTech’s Mobile Generation system can also provide Level 2 and Level 3 DC Fast Charging (up to and including 350 kVA on a Class 7 (13 liter) truck. ‘Levels’ indicate the charging power. The higher the level, the higher the power. More power equals shorter charging times. Level 2 is typically 240 volt AC (alternating current) power. Level 3 relies on 480 volt DC (direct current) power. Most Level 3 chargers provide an 80% charge in 30 minutes. 
 
The Company expects to deliver even more power in the future. That’s because the system is retrofittable. It can be uninstalled and reinstalled on a larger truck that generates more torque. 
 
Real Power uses a PTO driven generator to output 50 kW of power for Level 3 DC fast charging. Lightning Mobile puts a rechargeable package into a vehicle or trailer.to deliver DC fast charging at up to 80 kW and, optionally, Level 2 AC charging at up to 19.2 kW. In China, vans operated by Nio store about 200 kilowatt hours (kWh) for vehicle charging. The Blink Mobile Emergency Charger outputs up to 9.6 kW which equates to about 1 mile of charge per minute. 
 
The Mobi EV Charger is essentially batteries on wheels with a joystick drive system. The Level 2 fast charger is equipped with an 80-kWh battery. SparkCharge’s transportable fast-charging system incorporates a battery module that provides up to 20 kW of power.
 

9

 
Another variation on mobile charging relies on a self-contained unit that is dropped into place. EVgo’s Fast Start incorporates a pair of 50-kilowatt fast chargers on a metal sled. EV Safe Charge offers a temporary Level 2 and DC fast charging systems delivered to locations on demand. Depending upon on-site capabilities, chargers are powered either through existing power at the location, solar panels, or self-contained generating systems. Electrify America and Volkswagen have installed 30 solar powered charging stations in rural California that two provide two Level 2 charging plugs.
 
Both the battery-on-wheels and the delivery and drop-off systems aim to address the problems with permitting, construction and electrical infrastructure upgrades common to permanent charging installations.
 
We believe our proprietary technology is so powerful, innovative, versatile, easy to use and offers very attractive price points that we can compete in and even disrupt the remote power generation market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition.
 
Equipment
 
As a company that intends to commercialize or license its proprietary technology for others to install, manufacture and/or distribute, our equipment needs are project specific and temporary. We do not intend to purchase any production equipment to implement our business operations, but instead we will rent, lease or outsource as needed.
Manufacturing
 
We do not plan to manufacture in-house. The Company works with Craftsmen Industries utilizing its assets and system integrators to upfit our Mobile Generation technology. For our thermal technologies, the Company plans to rely on product development agreements with manufacturers who will then pay a license or royalty per unit. We anticipate that such agreements will delineate the respective intellectual property owned by both companies, describe the goal of the testing to verify the savings and value to a particular company, the equipment to be modified, the criteria that constitute successful testing, how and where the tests will be conducted and the next steps to be taken in the event of successful testing. 
Suppliers
 
For mobile power generation, the required software and its vehicle integration will be supplied by third party provider of engineering services along with partner truck up-fitter and others to be named later.
 
Production level quantities of system components will be handled by at least three suppliers. 
 
For the thermal technology applications in electric motors, a single supplier will provide the heat pipes and mechanical structure, which combine to make the heat exchangers. We will coordinate with them to combine our thermal technology with their technology in the creation of heat exchangers. 
 
For dry pit submersibles (a type of submersible pump which can also operate in a dry environment), we intend to purchase the wound stator and the rotor-shaft from one of the largest electric motor manufacturers in the world. We intend to purchase the fully-machined castings from an American company and rely on assembly and testing by another corporation based in the USA. 
 
As of April 6, 2021, we have not signed formal agreements with any suppliers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Currently, we have no licenses or contractual rights in place to protect our technology and intellectual property, only patents or patents pending. 

10

 
As of April 6, 2021, we have seven US patents, one Canadian patent, two granted patents (1 Mexican, 1 Canadian) and two pending applications (1 in the US, 1 in Brazil) covering composite heat structures, motors, and related structures, heat pipe architecture, and applications (commonly referred to as “thermal” or “heat dispersion technology”). We also have a Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application pending that covers integrated electrical power generation methods and systems. In addition, we have applied for and received a trademark for an acronym for one of our technologies: “TEHPC”
 
Our success will likely depend upon our ability to preserve our proprietary technologies and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. However, we may also rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable. 
 
We strive to protect such proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. The Company has a policy of not disclosing its patent applications in order to protect the underlying technology. 
 
The following table sets forth the patents we own or license which we believe support our technology.

Government and Industry Regulation
 
We intend to conduct business worldwide and, therefore, we must comply with local, state, federal, and international regulations, both in operations and for our products. 
 
As a company, we do not plan to manufacture any of our products. Therefore, the government regulations we will be subject to will be limited to storage and involve rotating the shafts of stored electric motors on a regular basis.
 
Applicable laws and regulations include those governing, among other things, the handling, storage and transportation of materials and products as well as noise and employee safety. 
 
In addition, some of our products are subject to various laws and regulations relating to, among other things, emissions and fuel requirements. 
 
Accordingly, we may be required or may voluntarily determine to obtain approval of our products from one or more of the organizations engaged in regulating product or environmental safety. These approvals could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and, if redesign were necessary, could result in a delay in the introduction of our products in various markets and applications.
 
Although we believe that our operations and products are in material compliance with current applicable regulations noted within this section, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. New regulations could also require our licensees to redesign their products which could cause us to redesign our technologies which, consequently, could affect market growth for our products.
 

11

 
As our thermal technologies are incorporated in existing motors, generators and other manufactured products that are already subject to regulation. The regulatory burden will fall on the original equipment manufacturers that license our technology. 
 
The Company adds a mobile power generation system to Class 3-8 work trucks. In addition to an existing generator incorporating our thermal technology, the gearing system will incorporate our thermal technology as well. The vehicle and drive train operate normally in accordance with manufacturer’s specifications. No regulations are violated or exceeded. Nonetheless, in some markets, the Company will have to certify that it meets federal, state or local noise and emission regulations. 
 
Our designs comply with current EPA emission standards and we believe they will comply with future requirements. 
 
No original vehicle parts will be significantly modified in the retrofitting process. There will be some additional parts (generator, touchscreens, software, sensors and controls) added, but these parts will not change how the vehicle operates in any way. The drive train will operate according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Therefore, we believe that the original warranty will remain in effect and we do not believe that the conversion will violate the Magnuson-Moss Act.
 
The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is a federal law that protects consumers by barring a vehicle manufacturer from voiding the warranty on a vehicle due to an aftermarket part unless the manufacturer can prove that the aftermarket part caused or contributed to the failure in the vehicle. The Company will warranty the MG System with an industry standard warranty. All of our other components (generator, human machine interface, software, controller/sensors) will be warranted by their respective manufacturers.
 
The Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) is charged with writing and enforcing safety and fuel economy standards for motor vehicles through their Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These standards require manufacturers to design their electrically powered vehicles so that, in the event of a crash, the electrical energy storage, conversion, and traction systems are either electrically isolated from the vehicle’s chassis or their voltage is below specified levels considered safe from electric shock hazards. Our planned no-idle version of our Mobile Generation system will be designed to meet or exceed these requirements. 
 
Optional components such as solar panels, batteries, water purification or desalination systems will be supplied and warrantied by their manufacturers
 
In addition, the total weight of the additional components should remain within the vehicle’s gross vehicle weight rating. As a result, we believe that our retrofits will comply with federal and state transportation regulations.
 
While we do not create and market our products around government subsidies and tax incentives, a class 3 to 5 MG truck equipped with a charger can provide a Level II charge to one or more electric vehicles. Our 200 kVA truck will provide Level III DC fast charging and a medium duty class 6 truck (Ford F-650) can power what is informally known as a mega-charger for vehicles like the Porsche Taycan or Tesla-- all from the truck bed. Assuming the MG truck qualifies as a charging station almost every state and a number of municipalities and utilities offer grants, rebates, tax credits, or other incentives for electric vehicle charging stations. 
 
If we fulfill all elements of our business plan, we will have to prepare for, understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our products will have to comply with the current emission standards that went into effect in the European Union in 2015, as well as the standards in other international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India, and China that are becoming more stringent.
