BUSINESS
Company Overview
Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage oncology company developing novel therapeutics to address the genetic and immunological promoters of cancer. MRTX849 is an investigational, selective, specific, potent and orally available KRAS G12C inhibitor in clinical development as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents. Adagrasib is the provisionally filed nonproprietary name for MRTX849. MRTX1133 is an investigational, selective, specific and potent KRAS G12D inhibitor in preclinical development. Sitravatinib is an investigational spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor designed to potently inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases ("RTK"s) and enhance immune responses through the inhibition of immunosuppressive signaling. We also have additional preclinical discovery programs which include potentially first-in-class and best-in-class product candidates specifically designed to address mutations and tumors where few treatment options exist. We approach each of our discovery and development programs with a singular focus: to translate our deep understanding of the molecular drivers of cancer into better therapies and better outcomes for patients.
KRAS Inhibitor Programs 

The RAS family of genes is the most commonly mutated oncogene and mutations in this gene family occur in up to approximately 25% of all human cancers. Among the RAS family members, mutations most frequently occur in KRAS (approximately 85% of all RAS family mutations). Tumors characterized by KRAS mutations are commonly associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that cancer cells exhibiting KRAS mutations are highly dependent on KRAS function for cell growth and survival. Our KRAS inhibitor programs are focused on the discovery and development of small molecule compounds that target KRAS G12C and G12D. We are pursuing development of our KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D inhibitor programs in both single agent and rational combination approaches.

MRTX849, a selective KRAS G12C inhibitor

MRTX849, our lead KRAS G12C compound, is an investigational, selective, specific, potent and orally available KRAS G12C inhibitor. MRTX849 is designed to directly inhibit KRAS G12C mutations. KRAS G12C mutations are present in approximately 14% of non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) adenocarcinoma patients, 3-4% of colorectal cancer (“CRC”) patients, 2% of pancreatic cancer patients, as well as smaller percentages of several other difficult-to-treat cancers. 
We received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) authorization of our investigational new drug application (“IND”) for MRTX849 in November 2018, and on January 15, 2019, we announced that we had dosed the first patient in the dose escalation phase of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors that harbor KRAS G12C mutations. Following single agent dose escalation, we have expanded into cohorts that include patients with NSCLC, CRC and those with other tumors that carry the KRAS G12C mutation. We have completed enrollment in a Phase 2 registration enabling cohort of MRTX849 as a monotherapy treatment for patients in at least 2nd line NSCLC. This trial also enables exploratory combination cohorts, including evaluating the combination of MRTX849 and a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in patients with NSCLC, the combination of MRTX849 and a pan-EGFR inhibitor (afatinib) in patients with advanced NSCLC, and the combination of MRTX849 and an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) in patients with CRC. In 2020, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of MRTX849 and a SHP-2 inhibitor (TNO-155) in patients with advanced NSCLC and advanced CRC. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of MRTX849 and a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in patients with NSCLC stratified by <1% Tumor Proportion Score ("TPS") score and ≥1% TPS score. In the first quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating MRTX849 as a monotherapy randomized against docetaxel in patients in at least 2nd line NSCLC. 
On October 25, 2020, at the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Therapeutics (“ENA”), we announced preliminary results from ongoing clinical trials for MRTX849 at a dose of 600 mg twice daily ("BID") in monotherapy as of August 30, 2020 and combination trials as of October 25, 2020. In a pooled assessment of 110 patients harboring a KRAS G12C mutation in NSCLC, CRC and other solid tumors, monotherapy MRTX849 was generally well tolerated; 4.5% of treatment-related adverse events had led to discontinuation. Over 50 patients had been treated with MRTX849 in combination with either pembrolizumab in NSCLC, cetuximab in CRC and TNO-155 in NSCLC or CRC. Each combination has been generally well tolerated; the pembrolizumab and cetuximab combination cohorts cleared the dose limiting toxicity evaluation period at the full dose of each commercial agent and at a 600 mg BID dose of MRTX849, and the TNO-155 combination dose escalation and expansion cohorts are ongoing at a 600 mg BID dose of MRTX849. 
Preliminary efficacy data was assessed as of August 30, 2020 in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with MRTX849 as a monotherapy at a 600 mg BID from a pooled Phase 1/1b cohort and Phase 2 registration-enabling cohort (n=51): 45% (23/51) of patients had a confirmed objective response rate (“ORR”), and 70% (16/23) of responders had a best tumor response of greater than 40%. Patients had a disease control rate (“DCR”) of 96% (49/51), with 3.6 months median duration of follow-up; 65% (33/51) of patients remained on treatment and 87% (20/23) of responders remained on treatment. 
Preliminary efficacy data was assessed as of August 30, 2020 in heavily pretreated patients with advanced CRC treated with MRTX849 as a monotherapy at a 600 mg BID dose. Efficacy data from pooled Phase 1/1b and Phase 2 cohorts (n=18): 17% (3/18) of patients had a confirmed ORR with 2 of 3 responders remaining on treatment. 94% (17/18) of patients had a DCR, with 67% (12/18) of patients remaining on treatment and 55% (10/18) of patients had a duration of treatment of greater than 4 months.
Preliminary efficacy data was assessed as of August 30, 2020 in six patients with advanced solid tumors, other than NSCLC and CRC, treated with MRTX849 as a monotherapy at 600 mg BID dose from a Phase 1/1b cohort. One patient each with pancreatic, ovarian, endometrial and cholangiocarcinoma tumors were treated and had a confirmed partial response to therapy. Two appendiceal cancer patients had stable disease and all six eligible patients remained on treatment.
MRTX849 Development in Collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("Novartis")
In July 2019, we announced a clinical collaboration agreement with Novartis to evaluate the combination of MRTX849 and Novartis’ investigational SHP2 inhibitor, TNO155, in patients with advanced solid tumors that harbor KRAS G12C mutations. Under the terms of the non-exclusive collaboration, we will sponsor the trial and we and Novartis will jointly oversee and share the costs of clinical development activities for the combined therapy. Novartis will provide TNO155 at no cost. This clinical trial is currently enrolling patients.
MRTX849 Development in Collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH ("BII")
In September 2020, we announced a clinical collaboration agreement with BII to evaluate the combination of MRTX849 and BII's investigational SOS1 inhibitor, BI 1701963, in patients with advanced solid tumors that harbor KRAS G12C mutations. Under the terms of the non-exclusive collaboration, we will sponsor the trial and we and BII will jointly oversee and share the costs of clinical development activities for the combined therapy.
MRTX1133, a selective KRAS G12D inhibitor
MRTX1133, our lead KRAS G12D compound, has been identified as a clinical development candidate and is an investigational, selective, specific and potent inhibitor of KRAS G12D. KRAS G12D mutations have been detected in over 25 different types of cancer, including pancreatic, colon, lung and endometrial adenocarcinoma. The prevalence of cancers harboring KRAS G12D mutations exceeds the prevalence of KRAS G12C positive cancers by greater than two-fold and is an area of significant unmet medical need.
On October 25, 2020 we announced initial preclinical in vivo data from MRTX1133. Based on preclinical analyses, MRTX1133 has a projected human half-life of approximately 50 hours and exhibits a low propensity for drug interactions or off-target pharmacology. MRTX1133 demonstrated tumor regression in multiple in vivo tumor models, including pancreatic and colorectal cancers. MRTX1133 has a low predicted target plasma concentration, based on its potency and high unbound fraction, and our goal is to achieve near complete and sustained target inhibition and maximal anti-tumor activity. To ensure sustained therapeutic levels are achieved, we are pursuing both oral and parenteral routes of administration in parallel to allow selection of the route that results in the optimal KRAS G12D inhibition as we plan for a Phase 1 clinical trial. 
MRTX849 and MRTX1133 Discovery Collaboration with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer")
In October 2014, we entered into a drug discovery collaboration and option agreement with Array BioPharma, Inc. ("Array," acquired by Pfizer in July 2019) whereby Array provided services to facilitate the discovery, optimization and development of small molecule compounds that bind and specifically inhibit KRAS G12C. In June 2017, the two parties entered into a second, separate discovery collaboration and option agreement whereby Array provided services to facilitate the discovery, optimization and development of small molecule compounds that bind and specifically inhibit KRAS G12D. Both agreements established an option mechanism which enabled the Company to elect an exclusive worldwide license under the technology for the development and commercialization of certain products based on such compounds. 
Under the agreements, following the joint discovery periods which have concluded, we executed our options to retain exclusive worldwide licenses to develop, manufacture and commercialize inhibitors of KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D, including but not limited to, MRTX849 and MRTX1133. Under each agreement, Pfizer is entitled to potential development milestone payments of up to $9.3 million, and tiered sales milestone payments of up to $337.0 million based upon worldwide net sales, and tiered royalties in the high single digits to mid-teens on worldwide net sales of products arising from the collaborations. Under the agreements, we have incurred $4.5 million in development milestone payments from inception through December 31, 2020.
Sitravatinib
Sitravatinib is a spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor designed to potently inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases (“RTK”s), including TAM family receptors (TYRO3, Axl, Mer), split family receptors (VEGFR2, KIT) and RET. Sitravatinib’s potent inhibition of TAM and split family RTKs may overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy through targeted reversal of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, enhancing antigen-specific T cell response and expanding dendritic cell-dependent antigen presentation. As an immuno-oncology agent, sitravatinib is being evaluated in combination with nivolumab (OPDIVO®), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (“BMS”) anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with NSCLC who have experienced documented disease progression following treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. Sitravatinib is also being developed in certain Asian territories in collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. (“BeiGene”) which is evaluating sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab, BeiGene’s anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in a number of advanced solid tumors.
Sitravatinib in Combination with Nivolumab
There are over 100,000 2nd or 3rd line NSCLC patients in the United States and Europe, who have derived prior clinical benefit following treatment with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor, with approximately 70,000 of these patients being of the non-squamous histology. We are enrolling an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in 2nd line non-squamous NSCLC patients whose tumors have progressed on prior therapy with platinum-chemotherapy in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor or 3rd line non-squamous NSCLC patients who have received chemotherapy followed by a checkpoint inhibitor. The Phase 3 clinical trial is comparing the combination of sitravatinib plus nivolumab randomized to docetaxel. The statistical design of the Phase 3 clinical trial includes an interim analysis of overall survival that we believe, if positive, could support an NDA submission seeking full approval. 
In January 2019, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with BMS in connection with the aforementioned Phase 3 clinical trial. Under the terms of the collaboration, we are sponsoring and funding the clinical trial and BMS is providing nivolumab at no cost. We maintain global development and commercial rights to sitravatinib outside of certain Asian territories and Australia and New Zealand, where we have partnered with BeiGene, and we are free to develop the program in combination with other agents. 
We also have several Phase 2 clinical trials in which we are evaluating sitravatinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma or other cancers who have experienced documented disease progression following prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or a checkpoint inhibitor.
Sitravatinib Development in Collaboration with BeiGene
In January 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “BeiGene Agreement”) with BeiGene. Under the BeiGene Agreement, we granted BeiGene an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sitravatinib in Asia (excluding Japan and certain and other countries), Australia and New Zealand (the "Licensed Territory"), and we retained exclusive rights for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of sitravatinib outside the Licensed Territory.
In November 2018, we dosed the first patient under the BeiGene Agreement to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of sitravatinib in combination with BeiGene’s investigational anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab, in patients with advanced solid tumors. BeiGene’s clinical trials will evaluate the combination of sitravatinib and tislelizumab in patients with solid tumors including NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular cancer, gastric cancer and ovarian cancer.
Market and Competition
NSCLC Market

The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2020, approximately 229,000 patients in the United States ("U.S.") were diagnosed with lung cancer and 136,000 died due to the disease. Lung cancer represents almost 13% of all new cancer cases in the U.S., and 22% of all cancer deaths. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is 20%, indicating a significant need for novel therapies to extend overall survival in this patient population.

The prognosis for advanced NSCLC is poor, and the primary objective of treating late-stage disease is to prolong overall survival, delay disease progression and control symptoms. The treatment algorithm for advanced NSCLC has changed significantly following recent approvals and label expansions of immuno-oncology agents, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors. In 2015, the FDA approved OPDIVO®, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and the first immuno-oncology agent approved for the treatment of squamous NSCLC. The approval of OPDIVO® in NSCLC was subsequently followed by FDA approval of three additional immuno-oncology agents in NSCLC, KEYTRUDA®, TECENTRIQ®, and IMFINZI®. These four agents, approved for multiple indications including NSCLC, accounted for over $21 billion in global sales in 2019.

Despite the advances in patient outcomes demonstrated by approved immuno-oncology therapies in NSCLC, a significant patient need remains. The percentage of patients who respond to approved immuno-oncology treatments is quite low, and of the patients that respond, the majority will still experience disease progression.

NSCLC represents a heterogeneous patient population with diverse tumor histology and underlying genomic aberrations. The clinical and commercial success of leading targeted agents across multiple indications, including NSCLC, demonstrates the potential of new targeted treatments for cancer. 
Competition
KRAS G12C

We are aware of three companies who currently have competing clinical-stage direct KRAS G12C inhibitor programs: Amgen, Inc., F. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd., and Novartis AG.
Sitravatinib in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors

There are several immune checkpoint inhibitors currently approved for use as single agents to treat multiple tumor types, including NSCLC. To augment the efficacy of these agents, combination studies are being conducted with a variety of potentially synergistic mechanisms, including inhibitors of CTLA-4, LAG3, and CSF-1R. Most of these combination studies are being conducted in patients who are naïve to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Direct mechanistic competitors to sitravatinib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients who failed previous immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy include CABOMETYX® (Exelixis, Inc.) and LENVIMA® (Eisai Co., Ltd.), both anti-VEGF agents that also inhibit other receptor tyrosine kinases. Additional potential competitors whose agents are being evaluated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients who failed previous immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy include Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Adenosine A2Ar inhibitor), BMS (GITR inhibitor and LAG3 inhibitor) and Syndax, Inc. (HDAC inhibitor). 
Oncology

In addition to companies that have kinase inhibitors addressing our targets of interest, our competition also includes hundreds of private and publicly traded companies that operate in the area of oncology but have therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. The oncology market in general is highly competitive with over 1,000 molecules currently in clinical development. Other important competitors, in addition to those mentioned above, are small and large biotechnology companies, specialty and regional pharmaceutical companies and multinational pharmaceutical companies, including but not limited to AbbVie Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bayer-Schering Pharmaceutical, Boehringer Ingelheim AG, Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
Intellectual Property

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection wherever appropriate for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies both in the United States and in other countries. We typically file for patents in the United States with counterparts in certain countries in Europe and certain key market countries in the rest of the world, thereby covering the major pharmaceutical markets. As of December 31, 2020, we own or co-own U.S. patents and patent applications and their foreign counterparts, including 35 issued U.S. patents, including one for KRAS 
inhibitors and 15 for sitravatinib and other kinase inhibitors, with expiration dates ranging from 2026 - 2040. In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent. 
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates, nor do we plan to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials and finished products for our preclinical and clinical trials.
Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented.
Government Regulation
The Regulatory Process for Drug Development
Our business activities, including the manufacturing of our product candidates and our ongoing research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Regulation by these government authorities is a significant component in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and services. Before marketing in the United States, any new drug developed must undergo rigorous preclinical testing, clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FDCA”). The FDCA and other various federal, state and foreign statutes govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, quality, and import and export of our medicines. State, local, and other authorities also regulate pharmaceutical manufacturing. 
Applicable legislation requires licensing of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, and governmental review and/or approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, adherence to good laboratory practices (“GLP”) and good clinical practices (“GCP”) during nonclinical and clinical testing and cGMP during production is required. Our manufacturing CMOs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other foreign equivalents to ensure that they are operating in compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, marketing authorization for each new medicine may require a rigorous manufacturing pre-approval inspection by regulatory authorities. Post approval, there are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and, depending on the significance of the change, changes may require prior FDA approval. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. 
In addition, we are subject to other state and federal laws, including, among others, anti-kickback laws, fraud and abuse, false claims laws, Sunshine Act, patient protection and affordable care, data privacy and security laws and regulations, and transparency laws that restrict certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, government coverage and reimbursement policies will both directly and indirectly impact our ability to successfully commercialize any future approved products, and such coverage and reimbursement policies will be impacted by enacted and any applicable future healthcare reform and drug pricing measures.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
To establish a new product candidate’s safety and efficacy, the FDA requires companies seeking approval to market a pharmaceutical drug product to submit extensive preclinical and clinical data, along with other information, for each indication for which the product will be labeled. The data and information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA), which must be accompanied by payment of a significant user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies. Generating the required data and information for an NDA takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial 
resources. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. The failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a product candidate under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate. Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each NDA submitted for FDA approval is given an internal administrative review within 60 days following submission of the NDA. If deemed sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will “file” the NDA. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established internal goals of eight months from submission for priority review of NDAs that cover new product candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, and 12 months from submission for the standard review of NDAs. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, these performance goals may change over time and the review is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the NDA can be approved. Before approving an NDA, the FDA can choose to inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with GMPs. The FDA may also audit sites at which clinical trials have been conducted to determine compliance with GCPs and data integrity. The FDA’s review of an NDA may also involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee, particularly for novel indications. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
As part of our clinical development plans, we are exploring the use of companion diagnostics to identify patients most likely to respond to our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are classified as medical devices under the FDCA in the United States and similarly in other foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates the medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, reporting, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, export and import, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostics require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval ("PMA").
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain a 510(k) clearance or PMA simultaneously with approval of the drug. Based on the draft guidance, and the FDA's past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will require a PMA for one or more companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our product candidates. The review of these companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our product candidates involves coordination of review by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such products and services. There is no uniform coverage and reimbursement policy among third-party payors in the United States; however, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices that are lower than they would otherwise be. The increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenue and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 201 employees located primarily in our offices in San Diego, California, of which 199 were full-time, exempt employees and the remaining were full-time, non-exempt employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
Fostering and maintaining a strong, healthy culture is fundamental to the success of our business. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs and resources to help them improve or maintain their health and encourage healthy behaviors. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a work from home policy for non-laboratory employees and additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. In addition, we provided our employees stipends to help cover dependent care costs related to COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. 
Our success depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain top talent. We believe a culture of diversity and inclusion enables us to create, develop and fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to meet our business objectives. We provide robust compensation plans to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include potential annual discretionary bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among others.
