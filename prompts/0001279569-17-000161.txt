Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
Our principal business is the exploration and development of our Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (“Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects” or “UKMP Projects”) located in the Ambler mining district in Northwest Alaska, United States, comprising the (i) Arctic Project, which contains a high-grade polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulfide (“VMS”) deposit (“Arctic Project”); and (ii) Bornite Project, which contains a carbonate-hosted copper deposit (“Bornite Project”). Our goals include expanding mineral resources and advancing our projects through technical, engineering and feasibility studies so that production decisions can be made on those projects. Our UKMP Projects are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary, NovaCopper US Inc. (“NovaCopper US”) (dba Trilogy Metals US), registered to do business in the State of Alaska.
 
Name, Address and Incorporation
 
Trilogy Metals Inc. was incorporated on April 27, 2011 under the name NovaCopper Inc. pursuant to the terms of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (“BCBCA”). NovaCopper Inc. changed its name to Trilogy Metals Inc. on September 1, 2016 to better reflect its diversified metals resource base. Our registered office is located at Suite 2600, Three Bentall Centre, 595 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and our executive office is located at Suite 1950, 777 Dunsmuir Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Business Cycle
 
Our business, at its current exploration phase, is cyclical. Exploration activities are conducted primarily during snow-free months in Alaska. The optimum field season at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects is from late May to late September. The length of the snow-free season at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects varies from about May through November at lower elevations and from July through September at higher elevations.
Trilogy’s Strategy
 
Our business strategy is focused on creating value for stakeholders through our ownership and advancement of the Arctic Project and exploration of the Bornite Project and through the pursuit of similarly attractive mining projects. We plan to:

· | advance the Arctic Project towards development with key activities including increased definition of the NI 43-101 mineral resources, technical studies to support completion of a pre-feasibility or feasibility study, and the advancement of baseline environmental studies; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | advance exploration in the Ambler mining district and, in particular, at the Bornite Project, pursuant to the NANA Agreement (as more particularly described under “History of Trilogy – Agreement with NANA Regional Corporation”) through resource development and initial technical studies; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | pursue project level or corporate transactions that are value accretive. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Arctic Project PEA represents an early stage study and highlights certain opportunities for us to further expand upon. Prior to commencing production, further studies that demonstrate the economic viability of the Arctic Project must be completed including pre-feasibility or feasibility studies, all necessary permits must be obtained, a production decision must be made by our board of directors (the “Board”), financing for construction and development must be arranged and construction must be completed. In addition, we will be required to address certain infrastructure challenges, including a road for access, transportation of supplies and mineral concentrate, and obtain additional rights, including surface use rights and access rights. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 
Significant Developments in 2016
 

· | On April 19, 2016, we released an updated resource estimate on the Bornite Project and on May 16, 2016 filed the NI 43-101 compliant Bornite Report (as defined herein). Shallow mineralization located in the Ruby Creek Zones, in the Upper and Lower Reefs are reported within a resource limiting pit shell. Indicated in-pit resources at the Bornite deposit at a 0.50% copper cutoff are 40.5 million tonnes at 1.02% copper grade. Inferred in-pit resources at the Bornite deposit at a 0.50% copper cutoff are 84.1 million tonnes at 0.95% copper grade. In addition to the in-pit resources, Inferred below pit resources at the Bornite deposit are reported (at an elevated 1.5% copper cutoff) as 57.8 million tonnes at 2.89% copper grade. Contained copper in Indicated Resources has increased from 334 to 913 million pounds constituting a 173% increase in contained metal. Total contained copper in Inferred Resources has decreased from 5,696 to 5,450 million pounds (1,768Mlbs in-pit and 3,683Mlbs below-pit) which constitutes a 4% decrease in contained metal due principally to moving in-pit Inferred Resources to the Indicated category. The update incorporated a new 3D lithology, alteration and structural model for the Bornite deposit, as well as results from previously un-sampled or partially sampled historical Kennecott drill core. Inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of the Inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. See “Cautionary Note to United States Investors.”

· | On August 18, 2016, we announced the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary Sunward Investments Ltd. (“Sunward Investments”) which indirectly owns the Titiribi property, located in Antioquia Province of Colombia, to Brazil Resources Inc. (“BRI”) in exchange for 5 million common shares of BRI and 1 million warrants. Each warrant is exercisable into one common share of BRI at a price of C$3.50 per BRI common share until September 1, 2018. On September 1, 2016, the close of the transaction, the consideration was valued at $8.2 million.

· | On September 8, 2016, the change of our name to Trilogy Metals Inc., which was previously approved by our shareholders, became effective and our shares began trading on the TSX and the NYSE-MKT under the new name and symbol “TMQ”. We changed our name to Trilogy to better reflect the diversity of minerals at our UKMP Projects. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On October 27, 2016, we released the drill results from the safe and successful 2016 summer field program for the Arctic Project. We completed thirteen diamond drill holes for a total of 3,058 meters of core. The 2016 drill program was designed to collect data for geotechnical, hydrological, waste rock characterization and metallurgical studies as well as further resource definition. Three drill holes representing 822 meters drilled were designed to collect geotechnical and hydrological data within the proposed Arctic open-pit. Four drill holes representing 1,030 meters drilled were designed to collect metallurgical samples, specifically targeting material within the initial production years of the Arctic open-pit. Six drill holes representing 1,206 meters drilled were designed to evaluate vertical and lateral continuity of the high grade polymetallic copper, gold, silver, lead, and zinc mineralization, and support upgrading of Inferred resources to Measured and Indicated resource classification within the area of the proposed Arctic open-pit. We were pleased to announce that all six infill holes encountered mineralized intervals consistent with previous drilling conducted within the resource area on the property. The updated geology domains and drill data will be incorporated into an updated resource estimate that will support a future pre-feasibility study. In addition to the drill program, we conducted an aquatics survey, avian survey, habitat survey, archaeological survey, and wetlands delineation survey, and continued ongoing baseline environmental data collection and acid-base-accounting/metal leaching sampling. The LiDAR survey that was incomplete last year due to weather conditions was also completed during the summer field program.

Significant Developments in 2015
 

· | On June 19, 2015, we announced the completion of a Plan of Arrangement (the “Arrangement”) with Sunward Resources Ltd. (“Sunward”), a publicly listed company on the TSX, resulting in the acquisition of Sunward by Trilogy. Under the terms of the Arrangement, Sunward shareholders received 0.3 of a Trilogy Common Share for each Sunward common share held resulting in the Company issuing approximately 43.1 million Common Shares to Sunward shareholders and Sunward directors holding Sunward deferred share units. Each Sunward stock option outstanding was exchanged for a fully-vested option to purchase Trilogy Common Shares (a “Sunward Arrangement Option”) for a period of 90 days, with the number of shares issuable and exercise price adjusted based on an exchange ratio of 0.3. A total of 2,505,000 Sunward Arrangement Options were issued to holders of Sunward stock options at closing.

· | On October 21, 2015, we announced the drill results from our 2015 summer field program for the Arctic Project. In total, fourteen diamond drill holes were completed amounting to a total of 3,056 meters drilled. In addition to the twelve resource estimation drill holes, two drill holes, representing 631 meters drilled, were completed to support preliminary rock mechanics and geotechnical studies and a hydrogeological assessment of the proposed Arctic open-pit. All fourteen drill holes encountered mineralized intervals, defined as a minimum of 1.0 meter copper interval with average grade >0.7% copper.

· | On October 22, 2015, we announced that Alaska’s Governor has authorized AIDEA to begin the environmental impact statement (“EIS”) process on AMDIAP, formerly known as the Ambler Mining District Industrial Access Road. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Significant Developments in 2014
 

· | On March 18, 2014, Trilogy reported an updated NI 43-101 resource estimate for the Bornite Project in a report entitled “NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Bornite Project, Northwest Alaska, USA”, dated effective April 1, 2014, which updated the resource estimate previously released on February 5, 2013. At the base case 0.5% copper cut-off grade, the Bornite Project was estimated to contain in-pit Indicated Resources of 14.1 million tonnes of 1.08% Cu or 334 million pounds of contained copper. At the base case 0.5% copper cut-off grade, the Bornite Project was estimated to contain in-pit Inferred Resources of 109.6 million tonnes of 0.94% Cu or 2,259 million pounds of contained copper. Resources were stated as potentially being economically viable in an open-pit mining scenario based on a projected metal price of $3.00 per pound copper, total site operating costs of $18.00 per tonne, 87% metallurgical recoveries and an average pit slope of 43 degrees. At the base case 1.5% copper cut-off grade, the Bornite Project was estimated to contain below-pit Inferred Resources of 55.6 million tonnes of 2.81% Cu or 3,437 million pounds of contained copper. Inferred resources were stated as potentially being economically viable in an underground mining scenario based on a projected metal price of $3.00 per pound copper, total site operating costs of $66.00 per tonne and an average metallurgical recovery of 87%. Inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and whether they can be mined legally or economically. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of the Inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. See “Cautionary Note to United States Investors.”

History of Trilogy 
 
Spin-Out
 
We were formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of NovaGold Resources Inc. (“NovaGold”). At a special meeting of securityholders of NovaGold held on March 28, 2012, the securityholders voted in favour of a special resolution approving the distribution of Common Shares of Trilogy to the shareholders of NovaGold as a return of capital through a statutory Plan of Arrangement under the Companies Act (Nova Scotia).
 
On April 30, 2012, all of the outstanding Trilogy Common Shares were distributed to shareholders of NovaGold such that each NovaGold shareholder of record at the close of business on April 27, 2012 received one Trilogy Common Share for every six common shares in the capital of NovaGold held at that time. The Trilogy Common Shares were listed and posted for trading on the TSX and on the NYSE-MKT under its previous symbol, NCQ, and former name, NovaCopper, on April 25, 2012.
 
Name Change
 
We changed our corporate name to Trilogy Metals Inc. from NovaCopper Inc. in 2016 to better reflect the diversity of minerals at our UKMP Projects. On September 8, 2016, upon the opening of the markets our shares began trading on the TSX and the NYSE-MKT under the symbol “TMQ”.
 
Agreement with NANA Regional Corporation
 
On October 19, 2011, NANA Regional Corporation, Inc. (“NANA”), an Alaska Native Corporation headquartered in Kotzebue, Alaska, and NovaCopper US entered an Exploration Agreement and Option Agreement, as amended (the “NANA Agreement”) for the cooperative development of NANA’s respective resource interests in the Ambler mining district of Northwest Alaska. The NANA Agreement consolidates our and NANA’s land holdings into an approximately 142,831-hectare land package and provides a framework for the exploration and any future development of this high-grade and prospective poly-metallic belt.

The NANA Agreement grants NovaCopper US the nonexclusive right to enter on, and the exclusive right to explore, the Bornite lands and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (“ANCSA”) lands (each as defined in the NANA Agreement) and in connection therewith, to construct and utilize temporary access roads, camps, airstrips and other incidental works. In consideration for this right, NovaCopper US paid to NANA $4 million in cash. NovaCopper US is also required to make payments to NANA for scholarship purposes in accordance with the terms of the NANA Agreement. NovaCopper US has further agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to train and employ NANA shareholders to perform work for NovaCopper US in connection with its operations on the Bornite lands, ANCSA lands and Ambler lands (as defined in the NANA Agreement) (collectively, the “Lands”). Under the NANA Agreement, NANA also has the right to appoint a board member to Trilogy’s Board within a five year period following our public listing on a stock exchange.
 
The NANA Agreement has a term of 20 years, with an option in favour of NovaCopper US to extend the term for an additional 10 years. The NANA Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or by NANA if NovaCopper US does not meet certain expenditure requirements on the Bornite lands and ANCSA lands.
 
If, following receipt of a feasibility study and the release for public comment of a related draft environmental impact statement, we decide to proceed with construction of a mine on the Lands, NovaCopper US will notify NANA in writing and NANA will have 120 days to elect to either (a) exercise a non-transferrable back-in-right to acquire an undivided ownership interest between 16% and 25% (as specified by NANA) of that specific project; or (b) not exercise its back-in-right, and instead receive a net proceeds royalty equal to 15% of the net proceeds realized by NovaCopper US from such project (following the recoupment by NovaCopper US of all costs incurred, including operating, capital and carrying costs). The cost to exercise such back-in-right is equal to the percentage interest in the project multiplied by the difference between (i) all costs incurred by NovaCopper US or its affiliates on the project, including historical costs incurred prior to the date of the NANA Agreement together with interest on the costs; and (ii) $40 million (subject to exceptions). This amount will be payable by NANA to NovaCopper US in cash at the time the parties enter into a joint venture agreement and in no event will the amount be less than zero.
 
In the event that NANA elects to exercise its back-in-right, the parties will as soon as reasonably practicable form a joint venture, with NANA’s interest being between 16% to 25% and NovaCopper US owning the balance of the interest in the joint venture. Upon formation of the joint venture, the joint venture will assume all of the obligations of NovaCopper US and be entitled to all the benefits of NovaCopper US under the NANA Agreement in connection with the mine to be developed and the related Lands. A party’s failure to pay its proportionate share of costs in connection with the joint venture will result in dilution of its interest. Each party will have a right of first refusal over any proposed transfer of the other party’s interest in the joint venture other than to an affiliate or for the purposes of granting security. A transfer by either party of any net proceeds royalty interest in a project other than for financing purposes will also be subject to a first right of refusal. A transfer of NANA’s net smelter return on the Lands is subject to a first right of refusal by NovaCopper US.
 
In connection with possible development of a mine on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands, NovaCopper US and NANA will execute a mining lease to allow NovaCopper US or the joint venture to construct and operate a mine on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands. These leases will provide NANA a 2% net smelter royalty as to production from the Bornite lands and a 2.5% net smelter royalty as to production from the ANCSA lands. If NovaCopper US decides to proceed with construction of a mine on the Ambler lands, NANA will enter into a surface use agreement with NovaCopper US which will afford NovaCopper US access to the Ambler lands along routes approved by NANA on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands. In consideration for the grant of such surface use rights, NovaCopper US will grant NANA a 1% net smelter royalty on production and an annual payment of $755 per acre (as adjusted for inflation each year beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the NANA Agreement and for each of the first 400 acres (and $100 for each additional acre) of the lands owned by NANA and used for access which are disturbed and not reclaimed.
 
We have formed an oversight committee with NANA, which consists of four representatives from each of Trilogy and NANA (the “Oversight Committee”). The Oversight Committee is responsible for certain planning and oversight matters carried out by us under the NANA Agreement. The planning and oversight matters that are the subject of the NANA Agreement will be determined by majority vote. The representatives of each of Trilogy and NANA attending a meeting will have one vote in the aggregate and in the event of a tie, the Trilogy representatives jointly shall have a deciding vote on all matters other than Subsistence Matters, as that term is defined in the NANA Agreement. There shall be no deciding vote on Subsistence Matters and we may not proceed with such matters unless approved by majority vote of the Oversight Committee or with the consent of NANA, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Principal Markets
 
We do not currently have a principal market. Our principal objective is to become a producer of copper.
 
Specialized Skill and Knowledge
 
All aspects of our business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, mining and accounting. See “Executive Officers of Trilogy” for details as to the specific skills and knowledge of our directors and management.
Environmental Protection
 
Mining is an extractive industry that impacts the environment. Our goal is to evaluate ways to minimize that impact and to develop safe, responsible and profitable operations by developing natural resources for the benefit of our employees, shareholders and communities and maintain high standards for environmental performance at our UKMP Projects. We strive to meet or exceed environmental standards at our UKMP Projects. One way we do this is through collaborations with local communities in Alaska, including Native Alaskan groups. Our environmental performance will be overseen at the Board level and environmental performance is the responsibility of the project manager.

· | All new activities and operations will be managed for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In the absence of regulation, best management practices will be applied to manage environmental risk. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We will strive to limit releases to the air, land or water and appropriately treat and dispose of waste.

Employees
 
As of November 30, 2016, we had 7 full-time employees, all of whom were employed at our executive office in Vancouver, BC. The number of individuals employed by us fluctuates throughout the year depending on the season; however, during 2016, we had, on average, 15 employees working for us. We have entered into executive employment agreements with two individuals, the CEO and CFO.
 
We believe our success is dependent on the performance of our management and key employees, many of whom have specialized skills in exploration in Alaska and the base metals industry. Substantially all of our exploration site employees have been active in the Ambler mining district for the last five years and are knowledgeable as to the geology, metallurgy and infrastructure related to mining development.

Segment Information
 
The Company’s reportable segments are based on geographic region for the Company’s operations. Segment information relating to our assets is provided under the section heading “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.
Competitive Conditions
 
The mineral exploration and development industry is competitive in all phases of exploration, development and production. There is a high degree of competition faced by us in Alaska and elsewhere for skilled management employees, suitable contractors for drilling operations, technical and engineering resources, and necessary exploration and mining equipment, and many of these competitor companies have greater financial resources, operational expertise, and/or more advanced properties than us. Additionally, our operations are in a remote location where skilled resources and support services are limited. We have in place experienced management personnel and continue to evaluate the required expertise and skills to carry out our operations. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to achieve our exploration and development in the future on terms we consider acceptable or at all. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
