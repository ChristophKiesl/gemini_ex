Item 1.    Description of Our Business
Our Company and Business Segments
We are a leading global digital marketplace connecting vehicle buyers and sellers. Leveraging leading-edge technology and focusing on innovation, our unique platform facilitates the marketing and sale of total-loss, damaged and low-value vehicles for a full spectrum of sellers. Headquartered in Westchester, IL, our company has two operating segments: United States and International. We maintain operations in the United States, which make up the United States segment and operations in Canada and the United Kingdom, which make up the International segment. We have more than 200 facilities across both business segments. These two operating segments also represent our two reportable segments. These segments represent geographic areas and reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and measures results. See Note - 15 - Segment Information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. Discussions throughout which refer to “North America” or “North American” include the combination of United States segment and operations in Canada from the International segment. 
We serve a global buyer base and a full spectrum of sellers, including insurance companies, dealerships, fleet lease and rental car companies, and charitable organizations. We offer sellers a comprehensive suite of services aimed at maximizing vehicle value, reducing administrative costs, shortening selling cycle time and delivering the highest economic returns. Our solutions provide global buyers with the vehicles they need to, among other things, fulfill their vehicle rebuild requirements, replacement part inventory or scrap demand. We provide global buyers with multiple bidding/buying digital channels, innovative vehicle merchandising, efficient evaluation services and online bidding tools, enhancing the overall purchasing experience. 
Fees for our services are earned from both buyers and sellers of vehicles sold through our channels. Approximately two-thirds of our revenue is earned from buyers and one-third of our revenue is earned from vehicle suppliers or sellers. In exchange for agreed-upon processing and service fees, we sell total loss, damaged and low-value vehicles on behalf of vehicle sellers primarily on a consignment basis, meaning that our sellers continue to own their vehicles until they are sold to buyers through one of our digital marketplaces. We also offer our vehicle sellers a number of other services for which fees may be charged, including, but not limited to, vehicle loan payoff, procuring and processing vehicle titles, inspection services, processing auto insurance claims, marketing and other services. In addition to the fees we collect from our vehicle sellers, we also charge fees to our buyers for each vehicle purchased based on a tiered structure that increases with the sales price of the vehicle and for certain additional services, including storage, transportation, and vehicle condition reporting.
We market vehicles to prospective buyers through our many marketplaces, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Auctions are typically held weekly for most locations and allow bidders to participate virtually at the auction. Certain vehicles are also offered for sale online via IAA Timed AuctionsTM, where bidders may bid on those vehicles for a fixed duration of time, and via IAA Buy NowTM where vehicles are offered for sale at a fixed price. All vehicles which are ready for sale are listed and available online on IAA Auction CenterTM, allowing prospective bidders to preview and bid on vehicles prior to the digital auction event. IAA Auction Center includes a "Fast Search" function that allows for filtering to quickly locate specific vehicles and offers logged-in buyers additional services such as "Enhanced Vehicle Details" that includes VIN details and Hollander Interchange parts data to help buyers make informed purchasing decisions. IAA Auction Center provides online buyers with an open, competitive digital bidding environment. Our mobile and online capabilities provide buyers the greatest flexibility in their purchasing options, exposing vehicles to bidders from around the globe and allowing bidders to participate in a greater number of auctions. Online inventory browsing, digital alerts (via email or through buyer app) and multiple vehicle payment methods reduce the time required to acquire vehicles, and the broader market exposure and increased competitive bidding generally drive higher selling prices. We believe the capabilities of our auction models maximize auction proceeds and returns for our vehicle sellers.
Our unique digital marketplace combined with our unique merchandising platform, provides buyers detailed information and optionality in how they bid and buy, which are key differentiators of our service offering and helps sellers achieve the highest selling price on a given vehicle. Leveraging leading-edge technology and focusing on innovation, we processed approximately 2.2 million total loss, damaged and low-value vehicles in fiscal 2020.
Our Corporate History and Our Separation from KAR Auction Services
IAA entered the vehicle salvage business in 1982, and first became a public company in 1991. After growing through a series of acquisitions, IAA was acquired by two private equity firms in 2005. The two private equity firms and certain members of IAA management contributed IAA to KAR in 2007. 
On February 27, 2018, KAR announced a plan to pursue the separation and spin-off (the "Separation") of IAA (its salvage auction services business) into a separate public company. On June 28, 2019 (the "Separation Date"), KAR completed the distribution of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of IAA to the holders of record of KAR's common stock on June 18, 2019, on a pro rata basis (the "Distribution"). Following the Separation and Distribution, IAA became an independent publicly-traded company and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "IAA." 
2020 Highlights and Developments
The COVID-19 Pandemic
The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has severely impacted, and continues to impact, worldwide economic activities. In an effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, government and health authorities around the world took extraordinary and wide-ranging actions, including orders to close all business not deemed “essential”, quarantines, “stay-at-home” orders, and the practice of social distancing. Given our operations, we are deemed “essential” and have remained open for business and our branches have continued to be operational. We have implemented strict health and sanitization protocols across all of our locations in an effort to keep our employees and customers safe. We have also activated contingency plans to ensure continued operations and business continuity across our global network. 
The significant decline in miles driven resulting from the stay-at-home orders that were executed in mid-March across North America and the United Kingdom translated into a reduction in vehicle assignments. This decline in volume significantly impacted our business in fiscal 2020. Even with gradual improvement in miles driven and vehicle assignments in the second half of 2020, miles driven remain lower than pre-COVID levels. Notwithstanding this reduction in volume, our net revenue per unit during fiscal 2020 increased compared to the prior year period due to benefits from our buyer digital transformation, enhanced service offerings such as IAA 360ViewTM and IAA InteractTM, as well as strong used car pricing and strong demand from buyers. In response to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we took a series of actions during fiscal 2020 to reduce costs and cash outlays and enhance our liquidity position. See Part II, Item 7, COVID-19 Impact on our Business, for further details.
Buyer Digital Transformation
During fiscal 2020, we completed the roll-out of our buyer digital transformation in the United States in April 2020 and in Canada in July 2020. IAA UK has operated an online, digital only auction since 2005. As a result, we have shifted to a fully online, digital auction model. Our online marketplaces allow prospective bidders to preview, bid and potentially buy vehicles prior to the auction event. Online inventory browsing and digital alerts (via email or through our buyer app) reduce the time required to acquire vehicles. 
Our Industry and Trends in Market Demand
The salvage vehicle auction industry provides a venue for sellers, primarily automobile insurance companies, to dispose or liquidate total loss, damaged or low-value vehicles to domestic and international dismantlers, rebuilders, scrap dealers or qualified public buyers.
We believe that demand for our services in the salvage vehicle auction industry is driven and impacted by several factors, including (i) size and age of automotive Car Parc (as defined below), (ii) miles driven, (iii) increases in vehicle complexity and total loss frequency and (iv) higher utilization of recycled and alternative automotive parts.
(i) Size and Age of Automotive Car Parc
The salvage vehicle marketplace has historically benefited from a growing number of vehicles on the road ("Car Parc") and an increasing average age of vehicles. Growth in the number of vehicles in operation contributes to a rising number of automotive accidents, which supports increased volumes through our marketplaces. Meanwhile, vehicle owners have continued to drive the same vehicle for longer periods of time. As vehicles become older and their residual values decline, it becomes more likely that these vehicles will surpass the total loss threshold when involved in an accident and be sold on behalf of insurers through our marketplaces.
(ii) Miles Driven
The salvage vehicle marketplace is directly impacted by the number of miles driven. The significant decline in miles driven resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic-related stay-at home orders that were executed in mid-March of fiscal 2020 across North America and the United Kingdom translated into a reduction in the number of car accidents and, in turn, a reduction in vehicle assignment volumes in our marketplace. 
(iii) Increases in Vehicle Complexity and Total Loss Frequency
Vehicle design has become increasingly more complex in recent years, as automotive manufacturers seek to differentiate themselves from competitors by incorporating new complex technologies and other enhancements into their designs in order to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. These technological advancements have resulted in higher repair and part replacement costs following an accident, making insurance companies more likely to declare a damaged vehicle a total loss. The percentage of claims resulting in total losses has steadily increased over the last five years. When a vehicle is deemed a total loss, insurers typically auction the vehicle through a salvage vehicle marketplace.
(iv) Higher Utilization of Recycled and Alternative Automotive Parts
As insurance companies continue to identify ways to reduce their claim costs, the utilization and acceptance rates continue to increase for recycled parts from total loss vehicles and aftermarket replacement parts. We believe this trend is helping increase revenue for our buyer base, which in turn increases demand for our marketplaces. 
Our Operations 
We generate a significant portion of our revenue from auction fees and related services associated with our salvage auctions. Approximately two-thirds of our revenue is earned from buyers. Buyer revenue represents fees charged based on a tiered structure that increases with the sales price of the vehicle as well as service fees for additional services such as storage, transportation, and vehicle condition reporting. Approximately one-third of our revenue is earned from vehicle suppliers or sellers. Supplier revenue represents the combination of the inbound tow, processing, storage, titling, enhancing and auctioning of the vehicle. 
The majority of our business comprises auctioning consigned vehicles. We recognize revenues from consigned vehicles on a net basis in the amount of fees charged. However, our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold. We also purchase vehicles in certain situations and resell them. We recognize revenues from purchased vehicles on a gross basis, which results in lower gross margin versus vehicles sold at auction on a consignment basis.
Our operating expenses consist of cost of services, cost of vehicle sales, selling, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. Cost of services is comprised of payroll and related costs, subcontract services, supplies, insurance, property taxes, utilities, service contract claims, maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites. Cost of vehicle sales is comprised of the cost of vehicles purchased. Cost of services and vehicle sales excludes depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of, among other things, payroll and related costs, sales and marketing, information technology services and professional fees.

We offer a comprehensive suite of auction, logistics and vehicle-selling services and solutions aimed at maximizing the value of vehicles sold through our global digital marketplaces, lowering administrative costs, shortening the selling cycle and increasing the predictability of returns to vehicle sellers.

Customers
We obtain our supply of vehicles from insurance companies, used vehicle dealers, rental car and fleet leasing companies, auto lenders and charitable organizations, among others. We have established long-term relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies in the markets we serve. The vast majority of the vehicles we process are on a consignment basis. The buyers of damaged and total loss vehicles include automotive body shops, rebuilders, used car dealers, automotive wholesalers, exporters, dismantlers, recyclers, brokers, and where allowed, non-licensed (public) buyers, among others. Approximately two-thirds of our revenue is earned from buyers and one-third of our revenue is earned from vehicle suppliers or 
sellers. During fiscal 2020, approximately 40% of our revenues were associated with vehicles supplied by our three largest insurance customers in the United States segment.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales force solicits prospective customers at the national, regional and local levels. Branch managers address customer needs at the local level. We also participate in a number of local, regional and national trade show events that further promote the benefits of our products and services.
In addition to providing sellers with a means of processing and selling vehicles, we offer a comprehensive suite of services to help maximize returns and shorten the selling and processing time. We help establish workflow integration within our sellers' processes, and view such mutually beneficial relationships as an essential component of our effort to attract and retain suppliers.
Our broad and industry leading geographic coverage allows us to service sellers on a national basis.
Our Internal Online Operating Solutions 
Our current internal online operating solutions include:
Automated Salvage Auction Processing (ASAP): We have developed a proprietary web-based information system, Automated Salvage Auction Processing system, or ASAP, to streamline all aspects of our operations and centralize operational data collection for the United States segment. The system provides sellers with 24-hour online access to powerful tools to manage the salvage disposition process, including inventory management, sales price analysis and electronic data interchange of titling information. Our other information systems, including AuctionNowTM and CSAToday® systems, are integrated with our ASAP product, facilitating auction processes and information flow with internal operational systems.
VISion: We have also developed a proprietary web-based information system, VISion, to streamline all aspects of our operations and centralize data collection for the International segment. The system is similar to ASAP and integrates with IAA technology products enabling us to be responsive to the needs of our international customers and operations. 
Competitive Conditions 
In our industry, we compete for sellers who supply vehicles to run through our auctions, and for buyers globally to bid on and purchase those vehicles. To attract sellers to use our global digital marketplace over that of our competitors, among other competitive areas, we focus on the following: providing industry-leading innovative products and services, such as the suite of services included in IAA Total Loss Solutions®, aimed at increasing the proportion of the vehicle processing function as a “one-stop-shop” for sellers in a manner that enhances customer integration with us; delivering a consistent high-satisfaction customer experience; maintaining a broad real estate footprint and capacity to meet market demand for storing and handling their vehicles; and delivering high value through sales results and competitive fee structures. 
Similarly, to attract buyers to our global digital marketplace, among other products and services, we offer the following: state of the art merchandising technology such as IAA 360 ViewTM - our latest proprietary imagery technology, which provides online vehicle buyers 360 degree rotating visual of the vehicle's interior and exterior, increasing confidence in their buying decision which we believe leads to higher auction sales prices; access to our patented, easy to use auction platform, IAA AuctionNowTM which provides buyers a customized bidding and purchasing experience; flexible bidding and buying channels such as IAA Buy NowTM - a complementary product to our online platforms, allowing buyers to purchase vehicles between auction dates, and IAA Timed AuctionsTM - which allows for bidding and buying of vehicles for a fixed time period before a scheduled auction; multiple ways to pay for vehicle purchases; and overall value and a competitive pricing and fee structure.
Our principal competitors include Copart, Inc.; Total Resource Auctions, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc.; independent auctions and a limited number of used vehicle auctions that regularly remarket damaged and total loss vehicles. Additionally, some dismantlers of damaged and total loss vehicles and Internet-based companies also enter the market from time to time. While most insurance companies have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell damaged and total loss vehicles without the use of service providers such as us, they may in the future decide to dispose of their vehicles directly to end users. See "Our market position and competitive advantage could be threatened by our competitors and/or disruptive new entrants" included in Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information.
Seasonality
The volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the availability and quality of salvage vehicles, holidays, and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. Used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. In 
addition, mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur, resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather.
Our Business Strategy
We maintain a long history of strong and consistent execution that has led to growth in the business over several decades in periods under both private and public ownership. We also hold a strong track record of acquiring and integrating independent auction operations and improving profitability. We seek to grow our business through the execution of the following strategies, among others: 
Enhance Existing Relationships and Expand Market Share
We continue to maintain strong relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies in the markets we serve and increase our penetration of non-insurance sellers. Additionally, we provide an alternative venue for damaged and lower-value vehicles and, as a result, non-insurance sellers have contributed to our growth.
Broaden Our Service Offering to Deepen Strategic Relationships
Our market-leading Total Loss Solutions® provides insurance companies with end-to-end outsourced solutions for the portion of the claims process prior to total loss determination and assignment to a salvage vehicle auction, which allows the insurance companies to reduce cycle time and cost, while improving employee engagement and customer service and ultimately increasing policyholder retention. Our IAA Loan Payoff solution mitigates the time-consuming process of managing a total loss claim requiring loan payoff and title release We continue to add additional innovative services and capabilities to our leading end-to-end solutions.
Continue to Enhance International Buyer Network
We are a leader in developing an international buyer network and continue to enhance our network through digital marketing, market alliance partners, and in country visits. We have customized our marketing approaches to cater to local cultures and ways of doing business, and have invested significant resources in developing a deep understanding of the unique needs of each international market. Expanding the base of international buyers brings more bidders to our platform and yields better outcomes for sellers in our global digital marketplace.
Our further commitment to our international buyers is demonstrated by our buyer portal, which is available online in 6 languages and our call center, which currently supports 12 languages.
Continue to Expand Margins Through Cost Reductions, Operating Efficiencies and Ancillary Services
We are focused on reducing costs and driving efficiencies while also maintaining our level of customer service. As a part of our buyer digital transformation initiative, we have shifted to a fully online, digital auction model which is generating cost savings by eliminating live physical auctions. Our ongoing initiatives in other areas such as towing, pricing and branch process improvement will further enable us to execute our strategy. 
We are also shortening the time it takes a vehicle to move through the auction process through our operational efficiency efforts and service offerings like IAA Total Loss Solutions® and IAA Loan Payoff. The shortened auction process timeline further improves the service we provide our customers, reduces depreciation on vehicle values, and also improves our operating margins by making our real estate usage more efficient. We also continuously analyze our vehicle storage process in order to optimize our real estate usage and our ability to process more volume without incurring incremental costs. We have further deployed additional digital tools into our yard operations to increase the efficiency of the vehicle check-in, title, inventory and sale processes. 
Continue to Innovate and Enhance Data Analytics Capabilities
Our solutions deliver enhanced economic benefits to our customers by increasing transparency and reducing cycle time and friction throughout the process. We continue to broaden our product portfolio by investing in the development of innovative solutions that further improve our customers’ results.
Using our data analytics expertise, we can provide better tools for both sellers and buyers to be better informed and make confident decisions to improve their results and satisfaction.
Expand Internationally in Attractive Markets
For the year ended December 27, 2020, approximately 12% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, and we are in the process of establishing or continuing to build operations in key geographic markets. In Canada, we plan to 
continue increasing our presence organically through Impact Auto Auctions Ltd. and in the United Kingdom, we plan to continue increasing our presence organically through IAA UK.
We also intend to strategically enter new markets by pursuing strategic acquisitions, partnerships or greenfield opportunities in high priority markets globally.
Employ Disciplined Capital Allocation Strategy 
We generate strong cash flows as a result of our attractive gross margins, the ability to leverage our corporate infrastructure across our multiple auction locations, low maintenance capital expenditures and limited working capital requirements. We are committed to adopting a balanced and disciplined capital allocation policy that will enable us to deliver attractive long-term stockholder value. Our long-term goal is to drive growth through disciplined investments in our organic business and through acquisitions, while also strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction and returning capital to stockholders. 
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, provincial and local authorities, agencies, statutes and ordinances, which, among other things, require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses, permits and qualifications to operate. They also govern the storage, handling and transfer of ownership of vehicles between buyers and sellers, and prescribe certain disclosures and notices that must be provided in interacting with our wholesale and retail buyer customers. Some of the regulations and laws that apply to our operations include, without limitation, the following:
•The acquisition and sale of totaled and recovered theft vehicles are regulated by state or other local motor vehicle departments in each of the locations in which we operate.
•Some of the transport vehicles used at our marketplaces are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation or similar regulatory agencies in the other countries in which we operate.
•In many states and provinces, regulations require that a damaged and total loss vehicle be forever "branded" with a salvage notice in order to notify prospective purchasers of the vehicle’s previous salvage status.
•Some state, provincial and local regulations limit who can purchase damaged and total loss vehicles, as well as determine whether a damaged and total loss vehicle can be sold as rebuildable or must be sold for parts or scrap only. 
•We are subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our auction and storage facilities, which requirements vary from location to location.
•We are indirectly subject to the regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 due to our vendor relationships with financial institutions.
•We deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations at certain locations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.
Compliance with these regulations and laws requires human level awareness, performance and expertise, and investments in our enterprise management systems to facilitate efficient workflow, data tracking and auditing capabilities to measure compliance. We invest annually in our information technology systems with a focus towards maintenance, security and system upgrades in order to comply with regulatory changes. Expenditures in these endeavors has been, and could in the future be, significant. 
For additional information on the potential impacts that could result from our failure to comply with the rules and regulations governing our operations, see further Item 1A, Risk Factors under the risk: "We are subject to certain governmental regulations, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws and currency reporting obligations. Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions." 
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could subject us to significant liability or require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions. From time to time, we have incurred, and may in the future incur, expenditures related to compliance with such foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant.
In the used vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of vehicles, including wrecked vehicles at salvage auctions, are stored and/or refurbished at auction facilities and during that time minor releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. We have investigated or remediated, or are currently investigating or remediating, contamination resulting from various sources, including gasoline, fuel additives (such as methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE), motor oil, petroleum products and other hazardous materials released from aboveground or underground storage tanks or in connection with current or former operations conducted at our facilities. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, expenditures relating to releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, have been and in the future could be significant, and have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, us to incur substantial compliance and other costs.
We implement a rigorous set of protocols and procedures to ensure that any fluid leaks from vehicles are promptly cleaned and storage areas are kept clean. Our employees receive training on how to properly respond to spills in the event any occur. Our employees also receive training on proper housekeeping and material management. We believe implementation of the protocols and procedures minimizes any potential environmental impacts to soil and groundwater at our locations.
Federal and state environmental authorities are currently investigating IAA's role, if any, in contributing to contamination at the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site in Seattle, Washington. IAA's potential liability, if any, at this site cannot be estimated at this time. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this matter.
Human Capital Resources 
Recruitment and Retention. In order to create and develop innovative industry leading products and services and to deliver the highest levels of customer service, we believe it is critical that we attract and retain talented and dedicated employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, to create a work environment where everyone feels included and empowered to do to their best work, and to give employees the opportunity to make a difference in the communities we serve.
At December 27, 2020, we had a total of approximately 3,640 employees, of which approximately 3,170 were located in the United States and approximately 470 were located in Canada and the United Kingdom. Approximately 99% of our workforce consists of full-time employees. We use innovative efforts to recruit, train and develop our employees for long-term success with the organization and, to the extent possible, we strive to promote from within the organization. Our employees have rated IAA a Great Place to Work® since 2018. 
In addition to the employee workforce, from time to time, we also utilize temporary labor services to assist in handling the vehicles consigned to us and to provide certain other services. Some of the services we provide are outsourced to third party providers that perform the services either on-site or off-site. The use of third party providers depends upon the resources available at each auction facility as well as peaks in the volume of vehicles offered at auction.
Compensation and Benefits Program. Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that we believe are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. In addition to cash and, in certain cases, equity compensation, we also offer full-time employees and part-time employees working more than 30 hours per week benefits such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan. We also provide an incentive to attract, retain and reward eligible employees through our employee stock purchase plan.
Workplace Safety. We strive to provide a safe work environment for both our employees and customers. We conduct regular employee training in the areas of safety and emergency preparedness. We believe we have an exemplary workplace safety record with a Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) rating of 1.61 during fiscal 2020, outperforming the industry average. We are classified as a motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and supplies merchant wholesaler (code 423110) by the National American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”).

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment of employees produces more creative solutions, results in better, more innovative products and services and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. We have a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) Council led by senior executives and comprised of employees at every level of the organization. The DEI Council focuses on initiatives to promote inclusion and cultural awareness and appreciation, increasing diversity and representation of historically underrepresented groups at the management levels and above, and also work with industry partners in their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
