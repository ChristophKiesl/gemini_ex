Item 1. Business
Overview



We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (an “Initial Business Combination”). We intend to effectuate an Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) that closed on February 23, 2021 and the Private Placement Units sold in a private placement (the “Private Placement Units”) that closed on February 23, 2021 and from additional issuances of, if any, our capital stock and our debt, or a combination of cash, stock and debt.



In connection with our formation, in June 2020, B. Riley Principal Investments, LLC (“BRPI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of B. Riley Financial, Inc. (“B. Riley Financial”), subscribed for 4,312,500 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. In June 2002, all of the Founder Shares were contributed to B. Riley Principal 150 Sponsor Co., LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of B. Riley Financial.



The Company completed the sale of 17,250,000 units (the “Public Units”), including the issuance of 2,250,000 Public Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full, at an offering price of $10.00 per Public Unit in the Public Offering on February 23, 2021. The Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 520,000 Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per unit in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) that closed on February 23, 2021 simultaneously with the Public Offering. The sale of the 17,250,000 Public Units in the Public Offering generated gross proceeds of $172,500,000, less underwriting commissions of $3,450,000 (2% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering) and other offering costs of $485,257. The sale of the Private Placement Units in the Private Placement generated $5,200,000 of gross proceeds.



Each Public Unit and Private Placement Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Class A common stock”, and with respect to the shares underlying the Public Units, the “Public Shares” and, with respect to the shares underlying the Private Placement Units, the “Private Placement Shares”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant” and, with respect to the Warrants underlying the Private Placement Units, the “Private Placement Warrants”), with each whole Warrant exercisable for one share of Class A common stock at an initial exercise price of $11.50 per share.



Upon completion of the Public Offering, $172,500,000 of proceeds were placed in the Company’s Trust Account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”) and have been and will continue to be invested in permitted United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Unless and until the Company completes the Initial Business Combination, it may pay its expenses only from the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside the Trust Account, which was $43,324 on December 31, 2021.



Proposed Business Combination



On October 24, 2021, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which was subsequently amended on December 29, 2021 (as it may be further amended, modified, or restated, the “Merger Agreement”) with BRPM Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and FaZe Clan Inc., a Delaware Corporation (“FaZe”), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into FaZe (the “Merger”), with FaZe surviving the Merger in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the related ancillary agreements, the “Proposed Transaction”). At the closing of the Proposed Transaction (“Closing”), the Company will change its name to “FaZe Holdings Inc.” (“Pubco”).

FaZe’s roster of more than 85 influential personalities consists of engaging content creators, Esports professionals, world-class gamers and a mix of talent who go beyond the world of gaming, including NFL star Kyler “FaZe K1” Murray, LeBron “FaZe Bronny” James Jr., Lil Yachty aka “FaZe Boat” and Offset aka “FaZe Offset.” Its gaming division includes ten competitive Esports teams who have won over 30 world championships.



The parties have ascribed an equity value of the combined company, following the consummation of the Proposed Transaction, of $987,000,000, assuming none of the Company’s public stockholders seek to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account.



Merger Agreement



In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Closing, we have agreed to issue to stockholders of FaZe approximately 67,023,763 shares of Pubco common stock at a deemed per share price of $10.00 (“Aggregate Equity Value Consideration”), plus earnout consideration of 6% of the total number of shares of Pubco common stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately after the Closing (which earnout consideration is subject to forfeiture following Closing if certain price-based vesting conditions are not met during the five years following Closing) (“Aggregate Earnout Consideration”).



Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each common stock purchase warrant of FaZe shall be exercised in full in accordance with its terms and each preferred stock purchase warrant of FaZe shall be exercised in full in accordance with its terms, each outstanding share of Series A preferred stock of FaZe will be automatically converted into common stock of FaZe (“FaZe common stock”), and the outstanding principal and accrued interest upon certain convertible promissory notes of FaZe (“FaZe Notes”) shall be converted into FaZe common stock (such exercises and conversions, collectively, the “FaZe Conversion”). The outstanding principal and accrued interests upon any FaZe Notes that do not convert will be paid in full prior to the Effective Time. It is estimated that approximately 12,711,205 shares of FaZe common stock will be issued pursuant to the FaZe Conversion (the “FaZe Conversion Shares”), based on the capitalization table of FaZe as of December 26, 2021 and assuming the Merger would become effective on December 26, 2021. The FaZe Conversion will not cause additional dilution to our public stockholders in excess of the dilution to public stockholders as a result of the Merger, because the shares of Pubco common stock to be issued and converted from the FaZe Conversion Shares upon the Merger are included in the aggregate merger consideration to FaZe securityholders set forth in the Merger Agreement.



At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of FaZe common stock (including the shares of FaZe common stock issued as a result of the FaZe Conversion) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Equity Value Consideration equal to the Exchange Ratio and a portion of the Aggregate Earnout Consideration equal to the Earnout Exchange Ratio (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”). The “Exchange Ratio” is the quotient obtained by dividing 65,000,000 by the fully-diluted number of shares of FaZe common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding certain shares, as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement). The “Earnout Exchange Ratio” is the quotient obtained by dividing the Aggregate Earnout Consideration by the fully-diluted number of shares of FaZe common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement).



At the Effective Time, each restricted share subject to a restricted stock award outstanding under FaZe’s existing incentive plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Pubco common stock having the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such restricted stock award immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Pubco Restricted Stock Award”), except that each Pubco Restricted Stock Award shall relate to a number of shares of Pubco common stock equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration. In addition, each such restricted stock award will have the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Earn-Out Consideration.



At the Effective Time, (i) each option outstanding under FaZe’s existing incentive plans that is vested in accordance with its terms as of the Effective Time (including each option that vests or is deemed vested in accordance with its terms in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) and (ii) 75% of those options that remain unvested as of the Effective Time (collectively, the “Vested Company Options”) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the net number of shares underlying such Vested Company Options as if each such net share was one share of FaZe common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.




2







At the Effective Time, each option outstanding under FaZe’s existing incentive plans other than a Vested Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be assumed by us and converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of FaZe common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and having an exercise price equal to the exercise price immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio.



Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Pubco’s bylaws following the Closing will provide that the Pubco common stock issued to FaZe stockholders as consideration in the Merger and issuable to directors, officers and employees of FaZe or its subsidiaries upon the settlement or exercise of restricted stock awards, stock options or other equity awards outstanding as of immediately following the Closing in respect of such FaZe restricted stock awards and stock options or other equity awards that were outstanding immediately prior to Closing, will be subject to a six month lock-up, subject to certain exceptions.



The parties to the Merger Agreement have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants with respect to the conduct of FaZe and the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Closing. The Closing is subject to certain customary conditions.



Support Agreements



In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, on October 24, 2021, we entered into a sponsor support agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”) with the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to (i) invest at least $20,000,000 in the PIPE Investment as well as to backstop the PIPE Investment, if the amount in cash actually received by us from the PIPE Investment at Closing is less than $100,000,000, by committing to purchase that portion of the PIPE Investment not purchased by third party investors to cause the PIPE Investment actually received by us at the Closing to equal $100,000,000, (ii) waive the anti-dilution and conversion price adjustments set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation with respect to the Founder Shares, (iii) subject 50% of the Founder Shares to forfeiture following Closing if certain price-based vesting conditions are not met during the five-year period beginning on the date that is 90 days after the Closing and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing date of the Proposed Transaction, (iv) subject the Founder Shares to certain transfer restrictions, and (v) vote all voting equity securities owned by it in favor of the Merger Agreement, the Proposed Transaction, and each other proposal presented by us.



In connection with the Merger Agreement, on October 24, 2021, FaZe entered into voting agreements (the “FaZe Support Agreements”) with certain of its stockholders, pursuant to which holders representing the requisite vote required to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby agreed to vote their shares in favor of the Proposed Transaction. Further, in connection with the Merger Agreement, on October 24, 2021, each holder of FaZe common stock purchase warrants and preferred stock purchase warrants of FaZe, respectively, agreed to exercise all outstanding warrants in whole prior to the Closing and certain holders of FaZe Notes elected to complete the FaZe Conversion prior to the Closing.



PIPE



Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into subscription agreements (“Subscription Agreements”) with investors (including investors related to or affiliated with the Sponsor and an investor related to or affiliated with existing FaZe stockholders) for an aggregate investment $118,000,000 (the “PIPE Investment”). The closing of the PIPE Investment is conditioned upon, among other things, the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to the PIPE Investment and the substantially concurrent consummation of the Proposed Transaction. The Subscription Agreements provide for certain customary registration rights for the PIPE Investors. Affiliates of the Sponsor have subscribed to purchase 2,200,000 shares of Class A common stock at $10.00 per share in the PIPE Investment, for an aggregate purchase price of $22,000,000.



For more information about the Merger Agreement and the Proposed Transaction, see our Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on January 7, 2022 (File No. 333-262047). Unless specifically stated, this Annual Report does not give effect to the Proposed Transaction and does not contain the risks associated with the Proposed Transaction. Such risks and effects relating to the Proposed Transaction are included in the Registration Statement, which includes a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Proposed Transaction.



The Proposed Transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, following the receipt of required approval by the stockholders of the Company and FaZe, required regulatory approvals and the fulfilment or waiver of other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the SEC in connection with the Proposed Transaction.

Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption



All of the 17,250,000 shares of Class A common stock sold as part of the Public Units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Initial Business Combination. In accordance with SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity’s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021, since all the shares of Class A common stock can be redeemed or become redeemable subject to the occurrence of future events considered outside the Company’s control under ASC 480-10-S99, all shares of Class A common stock subject to redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets.



The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit.



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate the Proposed Transaction, and any other Initial Business Combination, using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration.



If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity, as we plan to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Public Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing the Proposed Transaction or another Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



We entered into Subscription Agreements to raise additional funds through a private offering of equity securities in connection with the Proposed Transaction, and we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of any other Initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we have targeted, and may in the future, target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the Private Placement, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete the Proposed Transaction, or such other Initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we expect to complete the PIPE Investment simultaneously with the completion of the Proposed Transaction, and we would expect to complete any other financing simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In the case of an Initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, such as the Proposed Transaction, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the Initial Business Combination disclose, or would disclose, the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, as in the case of the Proposed Transaction, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with the Proposed Transaction or any other Initial Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements. At this time, except for the Subscription Agreements we entered into in connection with the PIPE Investment, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. Other than pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, none of our Sponsor, officers, directors or stockholders are required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our Initial Business Combination.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination



Nasdaq rules require that we must consummate an Initial Business Combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account). Our board of directors determined that the Proposed Transaction with FaZe satisfied this requirement. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of any other Initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm that regularly prepares fairness opinions solely with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. No such opinion was obtained in connection with the Proposed Transaction. If required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed Initial Business Combination will include such opinion. In addition, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any Initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. The Proposed Transaction was unanimously approved by our independent directors prior to our entry into the Merger Agreement.



We have structured the Proposed Transaction so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. If we do not complete the Proposed Transaction and search for an alternate Initial Business Combination, we anticipate structuring the transaction so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. Alternately, we may structure an Initial Business Combination other than the Proposed Transaction such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, as we have done in connection with the Proposed Transaction. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in FaZe or such other target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to the Proposed Transaction or such other Initial Business Combination will own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to closing. If we instead complete an alternate Initial Business Combination in which less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. If the Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. For additional information on the Proposed Transaction, you are urged to read our Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on January 7, 2022 (File No. 333-262047), the amendments thereto, as well as other documents filed with the SEC in connection with the Proposed Transaction. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any other target business with which we may ultimately complete our Initial Business Combination.



To the extent we effect our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management endeavored to evaluate the risks inherent in FaZe’s business, and will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any other particular target business, we cannot assure you that we have, or will, properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating FaZe, we conducted a due diligence review of FaZe, which included: (i) research on the industry in which FaZe operates; (ii) extensive meetings with FaZe’s management team and representatives regarding FaZe’s operations, major customers, financial prospects and other customary due diligence matters; (iii) legal and commercial review of FaZe’s material business contracts, books and records, government regulations and filings, intellectual property and information technology; and (iv) financial due diligence and analysis of FaZe with the assistance of its financial advisors. In evaluating any other prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We may also retain consultants with expertise relating to a prospective target business.




5







We have expended considerable time, and incurred considerable costs, to select and evaluate FaZe and to structure and pursue completion of the Proposed Transaction. The time required to select and evaluate any other target business and to structure and complete any other Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with that process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Initial Business Combination.



Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of such Initial Business Combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. For illustrative purposes, as of December 31, 2021, the amount in the Trust Account was approximately $10.00 per Public Share. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares, Private Placement Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. Such persons did not receive separate consideration for their waiver of redemption rights.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions; Submission of our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, as described above under the heading “Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination.” Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an Initial Business Combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed Initial Business Combination. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules. Our public stockholders will have the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of the Proposed Transaction in connection with a stockholder meeting to be called to approve the Proposed Transaction.



The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares by one of the two methods listed above is contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.



If, for an Initial Business Combination other than the Proposed Transaction, a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:




● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Upon the public announcement of such an Initial Business Combination, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our Public Shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.




6







In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares which are not purchased by our Sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the Initial Business Combination.



If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, as we intend to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If we seek stockholder approval, as we intend to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. Our Sponsor will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter agreement, and, in the case of the Proposed Transaction, the Sponsor Support Agreement, our Sponsor has, officers and directors have agreed to vote their its Founder Shares, Private Placement Shares and any Public Shares purchased (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction. Approval of our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, will require approval of a majority of our common stock entitled to vote that are voted on the matter. The failure to vote, broker non-votes, and abstentions will have no effect on the approval of our Initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our Sponsor’s Founder Shares and Private Placement Shares, we would need only 6,208,751 or approximately 36% of the 17,250,000 Public Shares sold in the Public Offering to be voted in favor of an Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, approved. If only a minimum quorum of shares of common stock is present at the meeting to approve our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, we would need only 688,126 Public Shares, or approximately 4% of the Public Shares, to be voted in favor of the Initial Business Combination in order for it to be approved. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our Sponsor, may make it more likely that we will consummate the Proposed Transaction or such other Initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against an Initial Business Combination, or do not vote at all, and irrespective of whether they hold Public Shares on the record date established for the shareholder meeting to approve our Initial Business Combination.



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed Initial Business Combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, and if the minimum cash condition is not waived by our target, we will not complete the Initial Business Combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our Initial Business Combination. The Proposed Transaction includes a minimum cash requirement of $218,000,000, which will be calculated after giving effect to redemptions by public stockholders, and payment of certain transaction expenses incurred by us and by FaZe, and the proceeds of the PIPE Investment.

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, as we currently intend to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem more than 20% of the shares sold in the Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an Initial Business Combination with a target, such as the Proposed Transaction, that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we will not restrict our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination.



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have until February 23, 2023 to complete the Proposed Transaction or another Initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete the Proposed Transaction or another Initial Business Combination by such deadline, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination by February 23, 2023.
Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting FaZe for the Proposed Transaction we encountered, and if we need to identify, evaluate and select another target business for our Initial Business Combination, we expect to encounter, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the Initial Business Combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may have placed us at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating the Proposed Transaction, and may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating any other Initial Business Combination.
Facilities



Our executive offices are located at 299 Park Avenue, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10171, and our telephone number is (212) 457-3300. Our executive offices are provided to us by an affiliate of our Sponsor. We have agreed to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a total of $3,750 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.

Employees



We currently have one officer. This individual is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but he intends to devote as much of his time as he deems necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time he will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the Initial Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination.

Risk Factors Summary



An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainties. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to:

● | We are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | While we intend to submit the Proposed Transaction to a vote of our stockholders, if we are not able to complete the Proposed Transaction and seek an alternate Initial Business Combination, or decide not to submit the Proposed Transaction to a vote of our stockholders, our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed Initial Business Combination, which means we may complete our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stockholders’ opportunity to effect their investment decision regarding a potential Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, may be limited to the exercise of the right to redeem Public Shares from us for cash. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, as we expect to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, our Sponsor has agreed to vote in favor of such Initial Business Combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable Initial Business Combination or optimize our capital structure. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The requirement that we complete our Initial Business Combination within the prescribed timeframe may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating an Initial Business Combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our search for an Initial Business Combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate an Initial Business Combination, including FaZe, may be materially adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and other events and the status of debt and equity markets, as well as protectionist legislation in our target markets.

● | If we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, as we expect to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may elect to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants from public stockholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, and reduce the public “float” of our Class A common stock or Public Warrants. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our Public Shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Transaction, or fails to comply with the procedures for submitting or tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our stockholders are not entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete the Proposed Transaction or another Initial Business Combination. If we have not completed the Proposed Transaction or another Initial Business Combination within the required time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on our redemption of their shares, and our Public Warrants will expire worthless. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient to allow us to operate until at least February 23, 2023, it could limit the amount of cash available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete the Proposed Transaction or another Initial Business Combination, and we will depend on loans from our Sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete the Proposed Transaction or another Initial Business Combination. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may face litigation and other risks as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Past performance by our management team and their affiliates, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the Company. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our stockholders do not have any rights or interests in funds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your Public Shares or Warrants, potentially at a loss. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unlike some other similarly structured special purpose acquisition companies, our Sponsor will receive additional shares of Class A common stock if we issue certain shares to consummate an Initial Business Combination. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The nominal purchase price paid by our Sponsor for the Founder Shares may result in significant dilution to the implied value of your Public Shares upon the consummation of the Proposed Transaction or another Initial Business Combination.
