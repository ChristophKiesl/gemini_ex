Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing, and commercializing innovative therapies that change patients’ lives for the better.  We concentrate on small-molecule therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action for the treatment of severe, life-threatening diseases with few or no approved therapies.  Our lead programs are in rare forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a rare neurological disease.  We recently announced positive topline data from registrational studies for both of our lead product candidates, bardoxolone methyl (bardoxolone) in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome and omaveloxolone in patients with a neurological disorder called Friedreich’s ataxia (FA).  Both bardoxolone and omaveloxolone activate the transcription factor Nrf2 to normalize mitochondrial function, restore redox balance, and resolve inflammation.  Because mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation are features of many diseases, we believe bardoxolone and omaveloxolone have many potential clinical applications.  We possess exclusive, worldwide rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize bardoxolone, omaveloxolone, and our next-generation Nrf2 activators, excluding certain Asian markets for bardoxolone in certain indications, which are licensed to Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (KKC).
 Programs in Chronic Kidney Disease
 We are developing bardoxolone for the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and other rare forms of CKD that, in the aggregate, affect more than 700,000 patients in the United States.  
 Alport syndrome is a rare, genetic form of CKD caused by mutations in the genes encoding type IV collagen, which is a major structural component of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidney.  Alport syndrome patients experience a progressive worsening of the kidney’s capacity to filter waste products out of the blood, which can lead to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and the need for chronic dialysis treatment or a kidney transplant.  Alport syndrome affects both children and adults. In patients with the most severe forms of the disease, approximately 50% progress to dialysis by age 25, 90% by age 40, and nearly 100% by age 60. According to the Alport Syndrome Foundation, Alport syndrome affects approximately 30,000 to 60,000 people in the United States.  There are currently no approved therapies to treat CKD caused by Alport syndrome.
 In November 2019, we announced that the Phase 3 portion of the CARDINAL study of bardoxolone in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome met its primary and key secondary Year 1 endpoints.  After 48 weeks of treatment, patients treated with bardoxolone had a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 9.50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.0001).  At Week 52, patients treated with bardoxolone had a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in mean retained eGFR, which is the eGFR change after a four-week withdrawal of drug, of 5.14 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.0012).  After 52 weeks, patients in the placebo arm of CARDINAL lost an average of 6.1 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Based on these positive results, and subject to discussions with regulatory authorities, we plan to proceed with the submission of regulatory filings this year for marketing approval in the United States.
 ADPKD is a rare and serious hereditary form of CKD caused by a genetic defect in PKD1 or PKD2 genes leading to the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys and other organs.  Cyst growth can cause the kidneys to expand up to five to seven times their normal volume, leading to pain and progressive loss of kidney function.  ADPKD affects both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups and is the leading inheritable cause of kidney failure with an estimated diagnosed population of 140,000 patients in the United States.  Despite current standard of care treatment, an estimated 50% of ADPKD patients progress to ESKD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant by 60 years of age.

In a Phase 2 study called PHOENIX, bardoxolone demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline of 9.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 in mean eGFR after 12 weeks of treatment in 31 patients with ADPKD.  Available historical data for 29 of these patients showed an average annual decline in eGFR of 4.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the three-year period prior to study entry.  In May 2019, we began enrollment in FALCON, an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial studying the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone in approximately 300 patients with ADPKD.  The trial will enroll a broad range of patients from 18 to 70 years old with an eGFR between 30 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m².  The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided us with written guidance that, in patients with ADPKD, an analysis of retained eGFR demonstrating an improvement versus placebo after one year of bardoxolone treatment may support accelerated approval, and an improvement versus placebo after two years of treatment may support full approval.
 Three additional rare forms of CKD were studied in PHOENIX, including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), type 1 diabetic CKD (T1D CKD), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).  In each of these Phase 2 cohorts, bardoxolone demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR after 12 weeks of treatment. We believe that clinical trials similar to the design of the Phase 3 CARDINAL and FALCON trials with a two-year duration and a retained eGFR benefit endpoint after one and two years of treatment may be acceptable for submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for these forms of CKD to the FDA.  We plan to pursue each of these rare and serious forms of CKD as commercial indications.
 The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to bardoxolone for the treatment of Alport syndrome and ADPKD, and the European Commission has granted orphan drug designation to bardoxolone for the treatment of Alport syndrome.
 Programs in Neurological Diseases
 We are developing omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA, an inherited, debilitating, and degenerative neuromuscular disorder that is typically diagnosed during adolescence and can ultimately lead to premature death.  Patients with FA experience progressive loss of coordination, muscle weakness, and fatigue, which commonly progresses to motor incapacitation and wheelchair reliance.  Symptoms generally occur in children, with patients requiring a wheelchair by their teens or early 20s.  FA affects approximately 5,000 children and adults in the United States and 22,000 individuals globally.  There are currently no approved therapies to treat FA.
 In October 2019, we announced that the registrational part 2 portion of the MOXIe Phase 2 trial of omaveloxolone in patients with FA met its primary endpoint of change in modified Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) relative to placebo after 48 weeks of treatment.  Patients treated with omaveloxolone (150 mg/day) demonstrated a statistically significant, placebo-corrected 2.40 point mean improvement (decrease) in mFARS after 48 weeks of treatment (p=0.014).  Omaveloxolone treatment was generally reported to be well-tolerated.  Based on these positive results, and subject to discussions with regulatory authorities, we plan to proceed with the submission of regulatory filings this year for marketing approval of omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA in the United States.  The FDA and the European Commission have granted orphan drug designation to omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA.
 In addition, we have observed compelling activity of omaveloxolone and our other Nrf2 activators in preclinical models of Parkinson’s disease, dementia, epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and we plan to pursue the development of omaveloxolone and our other Nrf2 activators for one or more of these diseases. 
 We are also developing RTA 901 in neurological indications.  RTA 901 is the lead product candidate from our Hsp90 modulator program.  We have observed favorable activity of RTA 901 in a range of preclinical models of neurological disease, including models of diabetic neuropathy, neuroinflammation, and neuropathic pain.  We have completed a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of RTA 901 administered orally, once-daily in healthy adult volunteers, and no safety or tolerability concerns were reported. We plan to continue development for RTA 901 in neurological diseases, such as diabetic neuropathy. We are the exclusive licensee of RTA 901 and have worldwide commercial rights.

Other Clinical Programs
 In addition to our lead programs in rare forms of CKD and a rare neurological disease, we are exploring additional clinical and preclinical programs.  Our most advanced program outside of CKD and neurological diseases is the registrational Phase 3 CATALYST study of bardoxolone in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) caused by connective tissue disease (CTD-PAH).  CTD-PAH is a rare, serious, and progressive disease that leads to heart failure and death.  CTD-PAH patients are less responsive to existing vasodilator therapies than patients with the more common, idiopathic form of PAH (I-PAH) and have a worse prognosis.  
 In a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with PAH called LARIAT, bardoxolone demonstrated a statistically significant, time-averaged increase in mean 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 16 weeks in CTD-PAH patients compared to baseline.  CATALYST is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone in CTD-PAH patients randomized one-to-one to active drug or placebo.  We completed the enrollment of CATALYST and expect to have top-line data in mid-2020.  Based on discussions with the FDA, the primary endpoint of CATALYST is the change from baseline in 6MWD compared to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment.  If positive, we believe that the results of CATALYST, together with other data from our development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval of bardoxolone for the treatment of CTD-PAH.  The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to bardoxolone for the treatment of PAH.
 In addition, we are developing RTA 1701, the lead product candidate from our proprietary series of RORγt inhibitors, for the potential treatment of a broad range of autoimmune, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.  We have completed a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of RTA 1701 in healthy adult volunteers.  No safety or tolerability concerns were reported, and we observed an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile. We plan to continue development for RTA 1701 in autoimmune, inflammatory, or fibrotic diseases. We retain all rights to our RORγt inhibitors, which are not subject to any existing commercial collaborations.

Foundational Biology of Our Nrf2 Activators
 

 
Inflammation and mitochondrial metabolism are closely associated. In many inflammatory diseases, mitochondrial metabolism becomes dysfunctional and is reprogrammed to suppress the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and increase the production of chemically-reactive molecules called “reactive oxygen species” (ROS). 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Once released from the mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplify pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, and increase the production of cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, TGFβ, and IL-6. The persistent production of cytokines, impaired redox balance, and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to chronic inflammation, which can ultimately lead to fibrosis and reduced organ function. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


By binding to Keap1, bardoxolone and omaveloxolone stabilize Nrf2 and increase its activity. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the resolution of inflammation by regulating the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, redox balance, and cytokine production. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Nrf2 activation normalizes mitochondrial metabolism and increases ATP production. It also increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes and systems that work together to reduce the levels of ROS and restore redox balance. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


By normalizing mitochondrial metabolism and restoring redox balance, Nrf2 inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling. In addition, Nrf2 directly suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes by inhibiting their transcription. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chronic, unresolved inflammation and impaired cellular metabolism are key features of many diseases.  Inflammation is an integral component of the normal immune response that occurs when cells encounter harmful stimuli, such as invading pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants.  During inflammation, cells activate inflammatory processes and complexes that increase the production of cytokines, which are proteins that recruit and activate immune cells.
 Inflammation and mitochondrial metabolism are closely associated.  The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of the cell as they produce the energy that the cell needs to function.  This energy is produced by converting fatty acids and glucose into ATP by a process called oxidative phosphorylation.  During inflammation, mitochondrial metabolism is temporarily reprogrammed to suppress oxidative phosphorylation.  Instead of primarily making ATP, the mitochondria divert fatty acids and glucose to increase the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. During this reprogramming, the mitochondria release ROS that can directly attack pathogens and amplify the production of cytokines.
 In a normal immune response, the resolution of inflammation begins after the harmful stimuli have been eliminated.  Nrf2 is a protein that plays a key role in the resolution of inflammation by regulating the expression of specific genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, redox balance, and cytokine production.  When activated, Nrf2 promotes the resolution of inflammation by normalizing mitochondrial metabolism, restoring redox balance, and suppressing cytokine production.  In many chronic and genetic diseases, Nrf2 activity is suppressed, and the resolution of inflammation fails to occur or is inadequate, leading to persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, excess production of ROS, and production of cytokines.  These processes cause chronic inflammation, which can ultimately lead to tissue damage and loss of organ function.  
 Bardoxolone and omaveloxolone are Nrf2 activators that selectively bind to Keap1, a protein that governs the activity of Nrf2 in response to cellular stress.  By binding to Keap1, bardoxolone and omaveloxolone stabilize Nrf2 and increase its activity.  Since mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation are features of many diseases, Nrf2 activators, such as bardoxolone and omaveloxolone, may have many potential clinical applications.  Bardoxolone and omaveloxolone have been extensively studied by many investigators.  Their tissue-protective and therapeutic effects have been observed in many preclinical models and are associated with meaningful improvements in hallmarks of disease progression, such as inflammation, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis.  Our Nrf2 activators are the subject of over 400 peer-reviewed publications and have been studied in over 50 preclinical animal models in which they have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, tissue-protective, or anti-fibrotic effects in the kidney, heart, brain, liver, lungs, vasculature, fat tissue, pancreas, bone marrow, intestines, eyes, spinal cord, prostate, inner ear, and skin.
 Programs in CKD
 We are developing bardoxolone for the treatment of patients with the following rare forms of CKD:  
  
• | Alport syndrome in our registrational CARDINAL study;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | ADPKD in our registrational FALCON study; and
--+----------------------------------------------


• | IgAN, FSGS, and T1D CKD
--+------------------------

 In addition, KKC, our strategic collaborator in CKD, is currently conducting its registrational trial of bardoxolone in diabetic (type 1 and 2) CKD in Japan.  KKC completed patient enrollment in this trial in June 2019 and expects to have topline data in the first half of 2022.
 Background on Rare Forms of CKD, eGFR, and the Burden of ESKD and Dialysis
 CKD is characterized by a progressive worsening in the rate at which the kidney filters waste products from the blood, called the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  eGFR is an estimate of GFR that nephrologists use to track the decline in kidney function and progression of CKD.  When GFR gets too low, patients develop ESKD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  
 11

Declining kidney function leads to the buildup of high levels of waste products in the blood that causes the patient to suffer symptoms, such as nausea and fatigue, and to develop complications including high blood pressure, anemia, weak bones, poor nutritional health, and nerve damage.  Normal individuals have an eGFR of approximately 120 mL/min/1.73 m2.  When eGFR declines to approximately 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or below, patients generally develop ESKD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  
 Dialysis leads to a reduced quality of life, and most patients must spend several hours at a dialysis clinic three times a week for the remainder of their life and may suffer side effects due to dialysis. Dialysis also increases the likelihood of serious and life-threatening complications, such as cardiovascular disease, and the five-year survival rate for hemodialysis patients is approximately 42%.  The number of patients with ESKD in the United States has nearly doubled in the last two decades with an estimated 747,000 patients as of 2017.  Approximately 30% of these patients suffer from a rare form of CKD.  In 2017, Medicare spending for all beneficiaries who had CKD was $120 billion, of which $36 billion was spent on patients with ESKD.
 Other than JYNARQUE®, which is approved for ADPKD, the only approved therapies in the United States that affect disease progression for any rare form of CKD we are studying are blood pressure medications, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), approved for diabetic kidney disease, that modestly slow the rate of kidney function loss.  There are no approved therapies in the United States for Alport syndrome, IgAN, T1D CKD, or FSGS.
 Bardoxolone Targets Pathways that Contribute to GFR Loss and ESKD
 Inflammatory processes initiated by a variety of pathogenic stimuli, including diabetes, systemic hypertension, IgA deposition, and genetic mutations, drive declining kidney function.  At the molecular level, these pathogenic stimuli activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that normally detect cellular damage or pathogens.  These signals induce mitochondrial dysfunction in which production of ATP is impaired in favor of production of pro-inflammatory mitochondrial ROS.  ROS production activates pro-inflammatory signaling complexes including NF-κB to produce TNFα, IL-6, IL-1, IFNγ, angiotensin II, and other cytokines that initiate inflammatory pathways in glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, and podocytes, while also recruiting activated macrophages and other inflammatory effector cells to the renal interstitium.  At the physiological level, chronic activation of pro-inflammatory pathways in these kidney cells promotes GFR loss.  
 Bardoxolone targets inflammatory pathways that contribute to kidney function loss.  The activity of Nrf2, the target of bardoxolone, has been shown to protect the kidney in preclinical studies that are the subject of many peer-reviewed manuscripts.  Nrf2 gene ablation intensifies inflammation, oxidative stress, and kidney injury, remodeling, and fibrosis in multiple animal models of kidney disease.  Nrf2-knockout mice exhibit a lupus-like autoimmune nephritis, and histologic analyses of kidney tissue show impaired antioxidant activity and increased oxidative damage including enlarged glomeruli, mesangial cell proliferation, GBM thickening, and glomerulosclerosis.  Kidney function is compromised in these animals, as evidenced by a significant decrease in creatinine clearance and survival.  Similarly, Nrf2-knockout mice are more susceptible to nephrotoxic insults and develop more severe kidney impairment in multiple animal models of kidney disease.
 In a large biopsy study of 157 patients representing nine different types of CKD, patients’ biopsy samples were analyzed to determine genes and mutations associated with kidney function, as assessed clinically by eGFR.  Etiologies of CKD included thin basement membrane nephropathy, of which most are now considered patients with Alport syndrome, IgAN, diabetes, FSGS, hypertension, lupus, and others.  Eighteen genes and 97 molecular pathways were identified that affect eGFR.  Two clusters of pathways were identified that comprise inflammation and metabolic pathways, and Nrf2 was identified as a central link.  Collectively, these data establish that Nrf2 plays an important role in maintaining the function and structure of the kidney.  The data also demonstrate that Nrf2 affects a final common pathway of progression across diverse etiologies of CKD.
 Recently, the mechanism underlying the regulation of GFR by the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway was investigated in the laboratory of Dr. Naoki Kashihara at the Kawasaki Medical School in Japan.  Our proprietary Nrf2 activator RTA dh404 (10 mg/kg/day) increased single nephron GFR in the control group but not in mice lacking the Nrf2 gene (p<0.05).  In mice lacking Keap1, leading to activation of Nrf2, single nephron GFR was also elevated compared to the control group (p<0.05).  The glomerular afferent/efferent arteriole ratio was not significantly altered 
 12

in any group, indicating that activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway increases GFR by increasing effective glomerular filtration area without affecting the afferent/efferent arteriole ratio.  Additionally, RTA dh404 did not affect the glomerular permeability of albumin, suggesting that transient increases in albuminuria observed in clinical trials of bardoxolone are related to increases in eGFR rather than renal injury.
 Overview of Clinical Evidence of Bardoxolone’s Effect on Kidney Function in CKD 
 Prior to our CARDINAL Phase 3 trial, clinical trials enrolling over 2,000 patients exposed to bardoxolone have demonstrated consistent, clinically meaningful improvement in kidney function across several disease states as measured by eGFR and other markers of kidney function.  Specifically, we have observed statistically significant increases in eGFR in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in seven distinct patient populations treated with bardoxolone, including patients with PAH and CKD caused by type 2 diabetes (T2D CKD), Alport syndrome, ADPKD, IgAN, T1D CKD, and FSGS.  
 We believe these data, in addition to the CARDINAL Phase 3 data, support the potential for bardoxolone to delay or prevent dialysis, kidney transplant, and death in patients with Alport syndrome and other forms of CKD.  
 Additional observations from the prior clinical trials of bardoxolone include the following: 
  
• | Statistically significant increases in directly-measured GFR using the “gold standard” inulin clearance method, improvements in creatinine clearance, and reduction in the levels of blood waste products filtered by the kidney.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Statistically significant improvements in eGFR versus baseline or placebo in six different types of CKD, including Alport syndrome, ADPKD, IgAN, T1D CKD, T2D CKD, and FSGS.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustained improvement in kidney function in long-term trials:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL, bardoxolone treatment produced a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR of 10.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.0001) after 48 weeks of treatment, which, based on historical data available for 22 of the patients prior to enrolling in the trial, represents a recovery of over two years of average decline in kidney function.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In two large, placebo-controlled clinical studies (BEAM and BEACON) in patients with T2D CKD, statistically significant increases in mean eGFR of 14.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.001) and 5.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.001), respectively, were sustained for at least one year.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduction in risk of adverse kidney outcomes, suggesting that bardoxolone treatment preserves kidney function and may delay the onset of kidney failure in patients with T2D and stage 4 CKD:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In BEACON, patients randomized to bardoxolone were significantly less likely to experience adverse kidney outcomes as defined by a composite endpoint consisting of ≥30% decline from baseline in eGFR, eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, or ESKD events (HR=0.48, p<0.0001).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In BEACON, bardoxolone treatment resulted in a decreased number of kidney-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and ESKD events.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Statistically significant improvement in retained eGFR above baseline in BEAM, BEACON, the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL at one year, and the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL at one year.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The FDA has provided guidance to us and other sponsors that clinical trials with a retained eGFR benefit versus placebo may support approval in certain rare forms of CKD. The FDA has provided guidance to us that, in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome or ADPKD, a retained eGFR benefit versus placebo after one year of bardoxolone treatment may support accelerated approval and after two years of bardoxolone treatment may support full approval. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We believe the retained eGFR benefit observed in these clinical trials demonstrates that bardoxolone treatment improved the structure of the kidney, modified the course of the disease, and may prevent or delay kidney failure and the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant.

Bardoxolone Development Program for the Treatment of CKD Caused by Alport Syndrome
 Alport syndrome is a rare and serious hereditary disease that can manifest as early as the first decade of life, causes average annual declines in eGFR of approximately 3 to 4 mL/min/1.73 m2, and affects approximately 30,000 to 60,000 patients in the United States.  In patients with the most severe forms of the disease, approximately 50% of patients progress to dialysis by age 25, 90% by age 40, and nearly 100% by age 60.  There are no approved therapies for Alport syndrome anywhere in the world.  
 In November 2019, we announced positive topline, Year 1 results from the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL studying bardoxolone in patients with Alport syndrome.  The Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL is an ongoing, international, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized registrational trial that enrolled 157 patients with Alport syndrome at approximately 50 study sites in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia.  Pediatric patients represented approximately 15% of enrolled patients.  Patients were randomized one-to-one to bardoxolone or placebo.  As the CARDINAL study is ongoing, we released the one-year results under a data access plan submitted to the FDA designed to preserve the integrity of the second year of the study and avoid disclosing data that would unblind individual patients to their treatment assignment.
 The primary endpoint for the study was the change in eGFR after 48 weeks of treatment.  After 48 weeks of treatment, patients treated with bardoxolone had a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in mean eGFR of 9.50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.0001).  Patients treated with bardoxolone experienced a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR of 4.72 mL/min/1.73 m2  (p=0.0004), while patients treated with placebo experienced a statistically significant decline from baseline in mean eGFR of -4.78 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.0002).


The key secondary endpoint for the study was the change in retained eGFR at 52 weeks.  At Week 52, patients treated with bardoxolone had a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in mean retained eGFR of 5.14 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.0012).  Patients treated with bardoxolone experienced a nonsignificant decline from baseline in mean retained eGFR of -0.96 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.45), while patients treated with placebo experienced a statistically significant decline from baseline in mean retained eGFR of -6.11 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.0001).  Similar efficacy at Week 48 and Week 52 was observed across multiple subgroups, including among pediatric patients.

The FDA has provided us with written guidance that, in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, an analysis of retained eGFR demonstrating an improvement versus placebo after one year of bardoxolone treatment may support an NDA submission for accelerated approval and an improvement versus placebo after two years of treatment may support full approval.  The second-year on-treatment eGFR will be measured after 100 weeks of treatment and the retained eGFR will be measured at Week 104 after withdrawal of drug for four weeks.  Patients who complete the study and meet eligibility requirements can participate in the open-label extension trial.  
 Bardoxolone was generally reported to be well tolerated in this study.  Seventy-five patients (97%) receiving bardoxolone and 73 patients (91%) receiving placebo experienced an adverse event (AE).  The reported AEs were generally mild to moderate in intensity, and the most common AEs observed more frequently in patients treated with bardoxolone compared to patients treated with placebo, were increases in aminotransferases and muscle spasms.  Nine patients (12%) receiving bardoxolone and four patients (5%) receiving placebo discontinued study drug due to an AE, and no individual AE contributed to more than two discontinuations in either group. 
 Four patients (5%) receiving bardoxolone and 10 patients (13%) receiving placebo experienced a treatment-emergent SAE.  No fluid overload or major adverse cardiac events were reported in patients treated with bardoxolone.  Blood pressure was reduced relative to baseline in the bardoxolone group but was not significantly different between the two groups.  
 Increases in aminotransferases are a pharmacological effect of bardoxolone, which increases production of aminotransferases in vitro. The aminotransferase increases observed in CARDINAL were associated with improvements (reductions) in total bilirubin and were not associated with liver injury, and we believe they are related to restoration of mitochondrial function.  Laboratory markers associated with pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, including urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and aminotransferases, were unchanged relative to placebo at Week 52 after a four-week withdrawal.

Bardoxolone Development Program for the Treatment of ADPKD
 ADPKD is an inherited, rare form of CKD caused by a genetic defect in PKD1 or PKD2 and is characterized by the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys.  Inflammation appears to play a role in cyst growth and is associated with disease progression in ADPKD.  PKD1 is the most common mutation, causing about 85% of ADPKD cases and patients with the PKD1 mutation to progress to ESKD, on average, by age 54.  ADPKD is the most common single-gene disorder of the kidneys, and there are an estimated 400,000 patients in the United States, with approximately 140,000 patients diagnosed.  The only therapy currently approved for ADPKD is JYNARQUE® (tolvaptan, developed by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.), which was approved in the United States during 2018.
 We have initiated a registrational Phase 3 trial called FALCON in patients with ADPKD.  FALCON is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone in approximately 300 patients with ADPKD randomized one-to-one to active drug or placebo.  We began enrollment in FALCON in May 2019.  The FDA has provided us with guidance that, in patients with ADPKD, an analysis of retained eGFR, demonstrating an improvement versus placebo after one year of bardoxolone treatment, may support an NDA submission for accelerated approval of bardoxolone for the treatment of ADPKD, and data demonstrating an improvement versus placebo in retained eGFR after two years of treatment may support full approval.  We will measure the retained eGFR benefit versus placebo at 52 weeks after treatment on study drug for 48 weeks and a four-week withdrawal of drug.  After 52 weeks, patients will resume study drug and will continue on study drug for a second year.  The second-year retained eGFR benefit will be measured at Week 104.
 FALCON was designed and powered based on data from the ADPKD cohort of the Phase 2 PHOENIX trial.  In PHOENIX, bardoxolone demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in eGFR of 9.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.0001) after 12 weeks of treatment in 31 patients with ADPKD.  Historical data available for 29 of the patients showed that their eGFR declined an average of 4.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year in the three-year period prior to enrolling in the trial.  The magnitude of improvement in eGFR observed with bardoxolone represents the recovery of approximately two years of average decline in kidney function in the patients in this trial.  The ADPKD patients showed a high response rate, with all but one patient showing improvement at Week 12.  No drug-related SAEs were reported and reported AEs were generally mild to moderate in intensity.
 


Bardoxolone Development Program for the Treatment of Other Rare Kidney Diseases
 We believe the mechanism of action of bardoxolone addresses a final common pathway of kidney function loss, and we have observed significant increases in eGFR in patients with declining kidney function from a variety of diseases.  As a consequence, we conducted a Phase 2 trial called PHOENIX to assess whether bardoxolone treatment can improve kidney function in patients with four rare forms of CKD: ADPKD, IgAN, T1D CKD, and FSGS.  IgAN is a rare form of CKD caused by the deposition of IgA complexes in the kidney and is estimated to affect 120,000 patients in the United States.  CKD is a common complication of T1D and is estimated to affect 20% of the approximately one million T1D patients in the United States.  FSGS is a rare form of CKD that results from the chronic inflammation and scarring of the glomeruli and affects an estimated 40,000 patients in the United States.  
 16

In aggregate, the prevalence of the five rare renal diseases in which we have generated clinical data exceeds 700,000 patients in the United States, representing a meaningful market for bardoxolone in rare forms of CKD.
 In PHOENIX, a total of 103 patients were enrolled in four separate cohorts and treated with bardoxolone for 12 weeks.  Each cohort showed statistically significant increases in mean eGFR at Week 12, as shown in the table below. 
 
 
 | Week 12 ΔeGFR (Mean ± SE) | P-value vs. Baseline
ADPKD (n=31) | 9.3 ± 1.4 | p < 0.0001 
IgAN (n=26) | 8.0 ± 1.6 | p < 0.0001 
T1D (n=28) | 5.5 ± 2.3 | p = 0.02 
FSGS (n=18) | 7.8 ± 2.2 | p = 0.003 
All (n=103) | 7.8 ± 0.9 | p < 0.0001 

 
Of the patients that reached Week 12, 88% experienced increases in eGFR at Week 12.  We also observed that bardoxolone significantly reduced mean systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mmHg (n=103; p=0.002) and mean diastolic blood pressure by 2.8 mmHg (n=103; p=0.0009).  Urinary albumin excretion was low upon study entry and remained unchanged by bardoxolone treatment (n=103; p=0.6).  The most commonly reported AE across all cohorts was muscle spasms, which were not associated with clinical signs or symptoms of muscle injury.  The overall rate of SAEs was low, with three patients reporting treatment-emergent SAEs, none of which were reported as related to bardoxolone.
 Based on the eGFR improvements observed in PHOENIX patients, we also plan to pursue IgAN, T1D CKD, and FSGS as commercial indications.  We believe that registrational clinical trials similar to the design of the Phase 3 CARDINAL and FALCON trials, with a two-year duration and a retained eGFR benefit endpoint after one and two years of treatment, would be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA to seek accelerated approval based on one year data and full approval based on the two year data of bardoxolone for the treatment of these forms of CKD.
 AYAME Trial in Diabetic CKD Conducted by KKC
 Upon completion of the Phase 2 TSUBAKI study, KKC’s clinical study of bardoxolone in patients with Stage 3 and 4 diabetic CKD in Japan, and successful discussions with the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), KKC initiated a Phase 3 outcomes trial called AYAME in patients with Stage 3 or 4 diabetic CKD in Japan. The primary endpoint is time to onset of a ≥ 30% decrease in eGFR from baseline or ESKD.  KKC completed patient enrollment in AYAME in June 2019 and expects to have topline data in the first half of 2022.
 Programs in Neurological Diseases
 We are developing omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA, an inherited, debilitating, and degenerative neuromuscular disorder that is usually diagnosed during adolescence and can ultimately lead to premature death.  In October 2019, we announced that the registrational Part 2 portion of the MOXIe Phase 2 trial of omaveloxolone in patients with FA met its primary endpoint of change in mFARS relative to placebo after 48 weeks of treatment.  Patients treated with omaveloxolone (150 mg/day) demonstrated a statistically significant, placebo-corrected 2.40 point mean improvement (decrease) in mFARS after 48 weeks of treatment (p=0.014).  Omaveloxolone treatment was generally reported to be well-tolerated.  Based on these positive results, and subject to discussions with regulatory authorities, we plan to proceed with the submission of regulatory filings this year for marketing approval of omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA in the United States.  
 17

We are developing RTA 901 for the treatment of neurological diseases.  RTA 901 is a highly potent and selective C-terminal modulator of Hsp90, which has a critical role in mitochondrial function, protein folding, and inflammation.  RTA 901 has demonstrated profound efficacy in a wide range of animal models of neurological disease, including diabetic neuropathy, neuroinflammation, and neuropathic pain.  RTA 901 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, with no safety or tolerability issues and with an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile.  We plan to continue development for RTA 901 in neurological diseases such as diabetic neuropathy.
 Omaveloxolone Development Program for the Treatment of Friedreich’s Ataxia
 FA is an inherited, life-shortening, debilitating, and degenerative neuromuscular disorder, which is normally diagnosed during adolescence.  Patients with FA experience initial symptoms in childhood, including progressive loss of coordination, muscle weakness, and fatigue, commonly resulting in motor incapacitation, with patients requiring a wheelchair by their teens or early 20s.  FA patients may also experience visual impairment, hearing loss, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy.  Based on literature and proprietary research, we believe FA affects approximately 5,000 children and adults in the United States and 22,000 individuals globally. 
 FA is typically caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene, which encodes the mitochondrial protein frataxin.  Pathogenic repeat expansions can lead to impaired transcription and reduced frataxin expression, which can lead to mitochondrial iron overload and poor cellular iron regulation, increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondrial ATP production.  
 Diagnosis of FA typically occurs by genetic testing, and approximately 75% of people with FA are diagnosed between six and 20 years of age.  Childhood-onset FA can occur as early as age five, is more common than later-onset FA, and normally involves more rapid disease progression.  Most FA patients have disease onset by approximately 13 to 15 years of age and, thereafter, have a mean duration until wheelchair use of 10 to 15 years.  The mean age of death for FA patients is 35 years.  Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of FA.  Patients are usually given guidelines for certain lifestyle habits and are recommended to follow a diet that is low in iron and encouraged to take vitamins and supplements.
 Rationale for Omaveloxolone in FA
 Because impaired ATP production in FA patients likely accounts for the progressive muscle weakness, decreased coordination, exercise intolerance, and fatigue observed in these patients, as well as other disease manifestations, we believe that omaveloxolone may be effective in treating this indication.  In FA patients, mitochondrial function is correlated with measures of neurologic function.  Further, data demonstrate that Nrf2 signaling is significantly impaired in FA patients, resulting in impairment of antioxidant defense mechanisms, while silencing of frataxin gene expression has been linked to decreases in expression of Nrf2.  Additionally, omaveloxolone has been shown in vitro to restore mitochondrial activity in fibroblasts isolated from FA patients.  Accordingly, we believe that Nrf2 activation by omaveloxolone may result in a clinical benefit to FA patients.
 Clinical Development of Omaveloxolone in FA
 Our Phase 2 trial, called MOXIe, was a two-part, international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled registrational trial that studied the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone in patients with FA.  Additionally, patients who completed the study and met eligibility requirements can participate in the open-label extension.  Part 1 of MOXIe was a dose-ranging study designed to assess safety and identify an optimal dose of omaveloxolone to test in the registrational part 2 portion of the study.  A dose of 150 mg per day was selected for part 2, and no safety concerns were noted by the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) that oversaw the trial and reviewed all safety data.  
 18

Based on data from part 1 of MOXIe, we designed and powered part 2 of MOXIe, an international, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized registrational Phase 2 trial, that enrolled 103 patients with FA at 11 trial sites in the United States, Europe, and Australia.  Part 2 of MOXIe is the largest global, interventional trial ever conducted in FA.  Patients were randomized one-to-one to omaveloxolone or placebo.  The primary analysis population included patients without pes cavus (n=82), a musculoskeletal foot deformity that may interfere with the patient’s ability to perform some components of the neurological exam used to score the primary endpoint of the study.  Safety analyses were evaluated in the all randomized population (n=103). 
 The primary endpoint for the trial was the change in the mFARS score for omaveloxolone relative to placebo after 48 weeks of treatment.  The mFARS is a physician-assessed neurological rating scale used to measure FA disease progression.  The FDA has indicated that mFARS is an acceptable primary endpoint to evaluate the effect of omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA and that it may consider either accelerated or full approval based on the overall results of the trial and strength of the data.  Omaveloxolone treatment demonstrated statistically significant evidence of efficacy for the primary endpoint of the trial, producing a placebo-corrected 2.40 point mean improvement (decrease) in mFARS (n=82; p=0.014).  Patients treated with omaveloxolone experienced a mean improvement (decrease) in mFARS of -1.55 points from baseline, while patients treated with placebo experienced a mean worsening (increase) in mFARS of +0.85 points from baseline.
 

Further, the observed placebo-corrected improvements in mFARS were time-dependent, increasing over the course of treatment with the largest improvement observed after 48 weeks of treatment.  
 

19

Omaveloxolone treatment also demonstrated statistically significant evidence of efficacy in mFARS at Week 48 when the pes cavus patients were included in the analysis (the all randomized population).  In the all randomized population, omaveloxolone treatment produced a statistically significant, placebo-corrected 1.93 point mean improvement (decrease) in mFARS (n=103; p=0.034).  Omaveloxolone treatment also improved several secondary endpoints included in the trial. 
 Omaveloxolone was reported to be generally well-tolerated in this trial.  Four (8%) omaveloxolone patients and two (4%) placebo patients discontinued trial drug due to an AE.  The reported AEs were generally mild to moderate in intensity, and the most common AEs (i.e., reported in > 20% of patients in either treatment group) observed more frequently in omaveloxolone compared to placebo were headache, nausea, increased aminotransferases, fatigue, and abdominal pain.  Increases in aminotransferases are a pharmacological effect of omaveloxolone, which increases production of aminotransferases in vitro, which we believe are related to restoration of mitochondrial function.  In MOXIe, the aminotransferase increases were associated with improvements (reductions) in total bilirubin and were not associated with liver injury.  
 The overall rate of SAEs was low, with three patients on omaveloxolone and three patients on placebo reporting SAEs while on treatment.  Two additional omaveloxolone-treated patients reported SAEs approximately two weeks after receiving their final dose.  No new safety signals were identified, and the reported SAEs were sporadic and generally expected in FA patients.  In the three omaveloxolone patients who reported SAEs while receiving omaveloxolone, none led to discontinuation.  Atrial fibrillation was balanced and reported in one omaveloxolone and one placebo patient.  One omaveloxolone patient-reported anemia that was due to a complication of a procedure and was considered unrelated to omaveloxolone.  One omaveloxolone patient reported multiple SAEs, including viral upper respiratory tract infection and laryngitis, along with palpitations, non-cardiac chest pain, and sinus tachycardia.  While several of this patient’s SAEs were considered possibly related to omaveloxolone, no imbalances in infection or arrhythmia AEs were observed overall in the trial.
 Based on the positive MOXIe results, and subject to discussions with regulatory authorities, we plan to proceed with the submission of regulatory filings this year for marketing approval in the United States.
 Market Opportunity for Omaveloxolone in Friedreich’s Ataxia
 FA is an ultra-orphan disease.  Based on literature and proprietary research, we believe there are approximately 22,000 individuals globally with FA, including 5,000 in the United States.  Approximately 3,600 worldwide patients are identified on the Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance’s registry, including approximately 1,800 in the United States.  FA impacts children and young adults, leading to wheelchair use and severely shortened life expectancy.  There is no approved therapy, and we believe treatment for FA patients is primarily concentrated in 9 FA centers of excellence, 10 ataxia centers, and 26 Muscular Dystrophy Association centers.  If approved by regulatory authorities, omaveloxolone has the potential to be the first therapy for the treatment of FA.  
Omaveloxolone in Other Neurological Diseases
 Because mitochondrial dysfunction is a key feature of many neuromuscular diseases, we believe omaveloxolone may be broadly applicable to treat neuromuscular diseases by activating Nrf2 to normalize and improve mitochondrial function and ATP production.  We have studied omaveloxolone and other Nrf2 activators in preclinical models of neuromuscular and neurological disease, including Huntington’s disease, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy.  Our Nrf2 activators reduced seizure frequency in refractory, progressive epilepsy models and restored mitochondrial function in biopsy samples from FA, ALS, and familial Parkinson’s disease patients.  In clinical trials, improvements in neuromuscular function have been observed in FA patients treated with omaveloxolone as assessed by mFARS rating scale, and improvements in mitochondrial function, as measured by reductions in blood lactate and heart rate, have been observed in patients with primary mitochondrial disease.  Accordingly, we believe that omaveloxolone has the potential to treat a number of neuromuscular diseases that currently have few or no effective therapies, and we plan to pursue the development of omaveloxolone and our other Nrf2 activators for one or more of these diseases.
 20

RTA 901 in Neurological Diseases
 RTA 901 is the lead product candidate from our Hsp90 modulator program, which includes highly potent and selective C-terminal modulators of Hsp90.  We have observed favorable activity of RTA 901 in a range of preclinical models of neurological disease, including models of diabetic neuropathy, neuroinflammation, and neuropathic pain.  RTA 901 administered orally once-daily has been observed to rescue existing nerve function, restore thermal and mechanical sensitivity, and improve nerve conductance velocity and mitochondrial function in rodent disease models.  We have completed a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of RTA 901 in healthy adult volunteers.  No safety or tolerability concerns were reported.  We plan to continue RTA 901 development activities in neurological diseases such as diabetic nephropathy. We are the exclusive licensee of RTA 901 and maintain worldwide commercial rights.
 Other Clinical Programs
 In addition to our lead programs in rare forms of CKD and a rare neurological disease, we are exploring additional clinical and preclinical programs.  Our most advanced program outside of CKD and neurological diseases is the pivotal CATALYST study of Bardoxolone in CTD-PAH.  Additionally, we are developing RTA 1701, the lead product candidate from our proprietary series of RORγt inhibitors, for the potential treatment of a broad range of autoimmune, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.  We have completed a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of RTA 1701 in healthy adult volunteers.  We plan to continue development for RTA 1701 in autoimmune, inflammatory, or fibrotic diseases. 
 Bardoxolone Development Program for the Treatment of CTD-PAH
 We are studying bardoxolone in CTD-PAH, which is a late and often fatal manifestation of many types of autoimmune disease, including systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, and others.  CTD-PAH is a subset of PAH, which results in a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately leading to right ventricular heart failure and death.  Female PAH patients outnumber males by a factor of two to one, and the onset of PAH generally occurs between the ages of 40 and 60, with the average age of onset being 53.  In comparison to patients with I-PAH, CTD-PAH patients generally have a worse prognosis and experience a higher occurrence of small vessel fibrosis and pulmonary veno-obstructive diseases.  CTD-PAH represents approximately 30% of the overall PAH population in the United States, and approximately 10-15% of patients with scleroderma or lupus erythematosus.  In the United States, the five-year survival rate for CTD-PAH patients is approximately 44% compared to I-PAH patients, who have a 68% five-year survival rate.
 PAH is a systemic disease affecting tissues beyond the cardiopulmonary system.  Inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to metabolic dysfunction, which promotes bioenergetic deficits and mitochondrial dysfunction.  The resulting reduction in glucose uptake, lipid oxidation, and cellular energy production translate to dyspnea, fatigue, and impaired functional activity in PAH patients despite optimal vasodilator therapy.  Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been connected with a phenotype in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells that may accelerate disease progression in PAH.  Mitochondrial dysfunction in PAH patients is characterized by, not only decreased Nrf2 activity but also increased NF-kB activity.
 Three classes of drugs are currently used to treat all etiologies of PAH: endothelin receptor antagonist (ERAs), PDE-5 inhibitors, and prostacyclins.  These agents are all systemic vasodilators that do not address the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in PAH.  Furthermore, their systemic hemodynamic effects can result in hypotension and syncope, or fainting, headache, flushing, and jaw pain, which generally limit their clinical effectiveness and can be exacerbated by clinically significant drug-drug interactions when used in combination. 
 In comparison to patients with I-PAH, CTD-PAH patients are generally less responsive to existing therapies; therefore, vasodilators approved for PAH generally do not yield as significant functional improvements in CTD-PAH patients.  A meta-analysis of 11 pivotal trials comprised of more than 2,700 PAH patients demonstrated that CTD-PAH patients benefit less from vasodilator therapies than I-PAH patients when measured by clinical worsening and improvements in 6MWD, with a response in CTD-PAH patients (9.6 meters) of approximately one-third of the response in I-PAH patients (30 meters).  Therefore, vasodilators provide a poor risk-benefit for CTD-PAH patients given minimal treatment effect and AEs.
 21

Rationale for Bardoxolone in CTD-PAH
 Bardoxolone directly targets the bioenergetic and inflammatory components of PAH.  PAH patients experience mitochondrial dysfunction, increased NF-kB activity, and related inflammatory pathways involved in ROS-mediated signaling, cellular proliferation, and fibrosis.  Bardoxolone, through the combined effect of Nrf2 activation and NF-kB suppression, has the potential to inhibit inflammatory and proliferative signaling, suppress ROS production and signaling, reduce the production of proteins related to fibrosis and tissue remodeling, and increase cellular respiration and ATP production.  Bardoxolone targets multiple cell types relevant to PAH, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages.  Additionally, unlike current therapies, bardoxolone does not cause systemic hemodynamic effects or drug-drug interactions in PAH patients.  Therefore, by addressing a novel pathway in PAH, we believe that bardoxolone may provide additional benefits beyond current PAH therapies, including increased functional capacity, effects beyond functional improvements, broader applicability, and as a combination therapy.
 Clinical Development for Bardoxolone in CTD-PAH
 We are conducting CATALYST, a multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial examining the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone in patients with CTD-PAH when added to standard-of-care vasodilator therapy.  Patients will be on up to two background therapies and will be randomized evenly to either bardoxolone or placebo, and the study drug will be administered once daily for 24 weeks.  Patients randomized to bardoxolone will start at 5 mg and will dose-escalate to 10 mg at Week 4 unless contraindicated clinically.  Based on discussion with the FDA, the primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in 6MWD relative to placebo at Week 24.  The trial is conservatively powered and all patients who complete the treatment period and meet eligibility requirements may continue into an extension trial to evaluate the intermediate and long-term safety of bardoxolone.  
 CATALYST was designed based on data from LARIAT, a Phase 2 trial in PAH.  Initial results from our Phase 2 LARIAT trial in patients with PAH showed that bardoxolone provided the greatest improvement in 6MWD to patients with CTD-PAH.  Patients with CTD-PAH treated with bardoxolone demonstrated a statistically significant increase in mean 6MWD of 38.2 meters (p<0.001) compared to baseline and a placebo-corrected change in 6MWD of 28.4 meters (p=0.07).  Further analysis of data from patients with CTD-PAH who would be eligible for inclusion in our Phase 3 trial, CATALYST, demonstrated a statistically significant increase in mean 6MWD of 42.7 meters (p<0.001) compared to baseline and a placebo-corrected change in 6MWD of 48.5 meters (p=0.005).
 The primary endpoint in CATALYST, which will be analyzed using the mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) statistical analysis method, is the placebo-corrected change in 6MWD from baseline to the end-of-treatment at 24 weeks.  As part of the planning to determine the sample size for CATALYST, we performed an analysis applying the MMRM statistical analysis method for CATALYST to the available end-of-treatment change in 6MWD data from CTD-PAH patients in LARIAT.  The LARIAT end-of-treatment analysis at Week 16 shows placebo-corrected change in 6MWD of 48.5 m (p=0.005) in patients without anemia and 21 m (p=0.037) in initial cohorts at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg.  A clinically meaningful improvement of 28.4 m (p=0.07) was observed across all patients.  The summary of our analysis using the change at the end of the treatment period on all patients and patients without anemia is shown in the table below.
  
Dataset | Treatment | N | Time-Averaged ∆6MWD (m) | Week 16 ∆6MWD (m)
---------------------+-------------------+----------------------+-------------------------+------------------
Change from Baseline | Placebo-corrected | Change from Baseline | Placebo-corrected 
All | Placebo | 7 | 0.6 p=0.96 | - | 9.8 p=0.44 | -
Bardoxolone | 15 | 26.7 p<0.001 | 26.1 p=0.06 | 38.2 p<0.001 | 28.4 p=0.07 
Without Anemia | Placebo | 5 | -10.1 p=0.39 | - | -5.8 p=0.68 | -
Bardoxolone | 14 | 30.2 p<0.001 | 40.3 p=0.009 | 42.7 p<0.001 | 48.5 p=0.005

Patients with anemia at baseline demonstrated larger variability and are excluded in CATALYST.  CATALYST is designed to detect a minimum treatment effect of 12.5 meters versus placebo assuming a standard deviation of 50 meters.  The observed treatment effect in the LARIAT CTD-PAH subgroup analyses, both with and without the anemic patients included, is meaningfully larger than the minimally detectable treatment effect in CATALYST.  Overall, bardoxolone was well tolerated in the LARIAT trial.  Among all PAH patients in Part 1, the most common AEs that were reported with higher incidence in the bardoxolone group compared with the placebo group included dyspnea (12.7% of patients), urinary tract infection (15.5%), decreased appetite (14.1%), and muscle spasm (16.9%).  Among all PAH patients in the placebo-controlled portion of the trial, one SAE of moderate pneumonia was considered by the investigator to be possibly drug-related.  After completing 16 weeks of treatment, all patients in LARIAT were eligible to receive bardoxolone in an open-label extension study.  
 The CATALYST trial has been fully enrolled with 202 patients.  Top-line data from CATALYST are expected to be available in mid-2020, and, if successful, may support an NDA submission for approval of bardoxolone for the treatment of CTD-PAH.  No safety concerns have been reported by the DSMB. 
 Market Opportunity for Bardoxolone in CTD-PAH
 We believe there is a significant opportunity for once-daily, orally administered bardoxolone to address, not only the overall PAH market currently served only by the existing vasodilator therapies but, significantly, CTD-PAH patients who receive limited efficacy and have a more severe form of PAH with high morbidity and mortality.  Based on literature and proprietary research, we believe there are approximately 12,000 CTD-PAH patients in the United States and 50,000 worldwide.  
 RTA 1701 in Autoimmune Diseases
 RTA 1701 is the lead product candidate from our proprietary series of RORγt inhibitors for the potential treatment of a broad range of autoimmune, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.  RTA 1701 is an orally-bioavailable, RORγt-selective allosteric inhibitor that suppresses Th17 differentiation in vitro and demonstrates strong efficacy in rodent disease models of autoimmune disease.  RTA 1701 also potently suppresses the production of IL-17A, a clinically important cytokine, in human immune cells and when dosed orally to non-human primates.  We have conducted a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of RTA 1701 in healthy adult volunteers.  No safety or tolerability concerns were reported, and we observed an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile.  We plan to continue development for RTA 1701 in autoimmune, inflammatory, or fibrotic diseases. We retain all rights to our RORγt inhibitors, which are not subject to any existing commercial collaborations. 
 Collaborations
 KKC Agreement
 In December 2009, we entered into an agreement with KKC, under which we provided KKC the right to develop and commercialize bardoxolone for renal, cardiovascular, diabetes, and certain related metabolic indications in Japan, China (including Hong Kong and Macao), South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia (the KKC Agreement).  These indications include, among others, CKD and PAH.  Total consideration under this agreement could reach $272.0 million in upfront and milestone payments, of which we have received $80.0 million.  Additionally, KKC is required to pay us royalties on net sales of licensed product sold by KKC, its affiliates, and sublicensees in its territory ranging from the low teens to the low 20% range depending on the country of sale and the amount of annual net sales.
 KKC is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct all preclinical and clinical activities necessary for the commercialization of licensed products in each country in the licensed territory.  Under this agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply KKC with clinical supply of licensed product required for KKC’s development in the licensed territory, and we are obligated to negotiate and execute commercial supply agreements with KKC.  Also, KKC has allowed us to conduct clinical activities in PAH and certain rare forms of kidney disease in Japan and has reimbursed us the majority of the costs for CARDINAL in Japan and is paying for the costs of a certain number of patients as the in-country caretaker in FALCON in Japan.
 23

The KKC Agreement will terminate automatically when the royalty term expires in all of KKC’s territory.  A royalty term expires in a country on the later of the expiration of all patents in such country or ten years after the first commercial sale in such country.  Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency or uncured material breach.  Additionally, KKC may terminate the agreement at will upon advance written notice.  In the event of any termination of the agreement by us for KKC’s uncured breach, bankruptcy, or insolvency or by KKC at will, KKC will transfer and assign to us the regulatory filings for bardoxolone and will license to us the relevant trademarks used with the products in their respective territories.
 Amended and Restated License Agreement with AbbVie 
 In September 2010, we entered into a license agreement with AbbVie (the AbbVie License Agreement), under which we provided AbbVie, formerly known as Abbott Pharmaceuticals PR Ltd., the exclusive right to conduct all regulatory activities, including obtaining regulatory approval, and commercialization of bardoxolone or other molecules for renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular indications, including CKD and PAH, in all other countries outside the United States not previously licensed to KKC under the KKC Agreement.  
 In December 2011, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie (the Collaboration Agreement) under which we provided AbbVie the right to jointly research, develop, and commercialize all second- and later-generation Nrf2 activators for all indications other than renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic indications.  This is a multi-molecule, multi-product collaboration across all indications, other than renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic indications that are covered in our bardoxolone license agreement with AbbVie and our agreement with KKC.  
 In October 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with AbbVie (the Reacquisition Agreement), under which we reacquired the development, manufacturing, and commercialization rights concerning our proprietary Nrf2 activator product platform originally licensed to AbbVie under the AbbVie License Agreement and the Collaboration Agreement.  Under the Reacquisition Agreement, the AbbVie License Agreement and the Collaboration Agreement were amended, resulting in AbbVie granting its exclusive sublicenses back to us, such that we reacquired the worldwide rights to bardoxolone, excluding certain Asian countries previously licensed to KKC, and the worldwide rights to omaveloxolone and the second-generation activators.  In exchange for such rights, we agreed to pay AbbVie a total of $330.0 million, of which we paid $100.0 million in December 2019, and the remainder is payable in installments of $150.0 million on June 30, 2020, and $80.0 million on November 30, 2021. In addition, AbbVie will receive an escalating, low single-digit royalty on worldwide net sales, on a product-by-product basis, of omaveloxolone and certain next-generation Nrf2 activators.  AbbVie will not receive royalties on bardoxolone sales.  By reacquiring our rights, we were relieved from our obligations under the AbbVie License Agreement and the Collaboration Agreement.
 After the $330.0 million has been paid to AbbVie, the licenses granted to AbbVie and the sublicenses granted to us with respect to omaveloxolone and certain next-generation Nrf2 activators will be terminated, with all rights reverting to us, and, if (or when) 18 months has elapsed since the execution of the Reacquisition Agreement, the licenses granted to AbbVie and the sublicenses granted to us with respect to bardoxolone, also will be terminated, with all rights reverting to us. 
 Competition 
 The development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products is highly competitive.  Our future commercial success depends on our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage.  We are aware of several advanced drug development programs in the rare forms of CKD for which we are developing bardoxolone and in FA for which we are developing omaveloxolone.
 24

Bardoxolone in CKD Caused by Alport Syndrome
 Currently, there are no approved therapies for CKD caused by Alport syndrome, and patients are commonly treated off-label with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.  If bardoxolone is approved and launched commercially, it will likely be the first treatment on the market in the United States.  We are aware of one therapy, RG-012 (lademirsen), developed by Sanofi S.A., which is in Phase 2 clinical development for patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  Additionally, several inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 protein, such as Jardiance®, developed by Boehringer Ingelheim, and Farxiga®, developed by AstraZeneca, are in development for inflammatory and inherited forms of CKD.
 Bardoxolone in CKD Caused by ADPKD
 Currently, there is one drug approved and multiple therapies in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of ADPKD.  In 2018, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. received approval by the FDA to market JYNARQUE® to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD.  Additional therapies reported to be in clinical development include venglustat, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical development by Sanofi Genzyme, tesevatinib, which is in Phase 2 clinical development by Kadmon Holdings, Inc., and lixivaptan from Palladio Biosciences, which is expected to launch pivotal studies early in 2020.
 Bardoxolone in CKD Caused by IgAN
 There are currently no therapies approved for IgAN, and patients are commonly treated off-label with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or immunosuppressant therapy.  We are aware of multiple drugs in advanced clinical development for IgAN, including OMS-721, nefecon, and sparsentan, which are in Phase 3 clinical development by Omeros Corporation, Calliditas Therapeutics AB, and Retrophin, Inc., respectively.  Additionally, we are aware of multiple Phase 2 clinical development programs including LNP023, IONIS-FB-LRx, cemsdisiran, AVB-S6-500, atacicept, and APL-2 by Novartis AG, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Aravive, Inc, Merck KGaA, and Apellis Pharmaceuticals Inc., respectively.
 Bardoxolone in CKD Caused by FSGS
 There are currently no therapies approved for FSGS, and patients are commonly treated off-label with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or immunosuppressant therapy.  There are multiple drugs in advanced clinical development for FSGS, including sparsentan, which is in Phase 3 clinical development by Retrophin, Inc., and CCX140, CXA-10, DMX-200, voclosporin, PF-06730512, and abatacept, which are reported to be in Phase 2 clinical development by ChemoCentryx, Inc., Complexa, Inc., Dimerix Bioscience Ltd., Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer Inc., and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, respectively.  
 Bardoxolone in CKD Caused by T1D CKD 
 There are currently no therapies approved to treat T1D CKD, and patients are commonly treated off-label with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. There are multiple programs in advanced clinical development, including Jardiance®, which is in Phase 3 development by Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company, GKT831, which is in Phase 2 clinical development by GenKyoTex SA, and Farxiga®, in development by AstraZeneca, which received fast track designation in August, 2019, for delaying the progression of renal failure and preventing cardiovascular and renal death in patients with CKD.  It is likely that Invokana® will also be developed for type 1 diabetic nephropathy.  Invokana® is developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation and Janssen Pharmaceuticals and was recently approved for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy.
 Omaveloxolone in FA 
 There are currently no therapies approved for FA.  If omaveloxolone is approved for the treatment of FA, it has the potential to be the first treatment on the market for this indication, but it currently faces pipeline competition.  Pipeline competition for this orphan disease results in competition for patient recruitment as well as investigators’ time and resources.  The only program in Phase 3 stage of development is Retrotope Inc.’s study of RT001, which launched in January 2020.  The remaining competitor product candidates are in Phase 1 or 2 clinical development 
 25

for FA, including MIN-102, vatiquinone, CTI-1601, and JOT101 from Minoryx Therapeutics, BioElectron Technology Corporation, Chondrial Therapeutics, and Jupiter Orphan Therapeutics, Inc., respectively.  Biohaven’s Troriluzole is in Phase 3 development for the treatment of patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA).  Biohaven intends to explore the development of Troriluzole for other ataxias, including FA pending the outcome of the ongoing clinical studies in SCA.
 Bardoxolone in CTD-PAH
 There are currently no therapies approved specifically for CTD-PAH.  If bardoxolone is approved for the treatment of patients with CTD-PAH for use in conjunction with currently approved therapies for PAH, such as ERAs, prostacyclins, and PDE-5 inhibitors, it will face competition with those current treatments such as macitentan, marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion) as Opsumit®; riociguat, marketed by Bayer AG (Bayer) as Adempas®; oral treprostinil, marketed by United Therapeutics Corporation as Orenitram®; ambrisentan, marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) as Letairis®; selexipag, marketed by Actelion as Uptravi®; and bosentan, marketed by Actelion as Tracleer®.  Patients with PAH frequently use more than one therapy; however, we may face competition for patients’ willingness and resources to add another clinical therapy.
 We may also face competition from potential new therapies in development.  For example, Bayer AG, Bial-Portela & Ca. SA, Biogen, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and Merck & Co Inc are actively developing compounds that are attempting to address a problem outside of vasodilation and are to be used or allow use in combination with existing treatments.  Their products appear to be in early clinical development.  We consider these our most direct competitors.
 Manufacture and Supply
 We rely on multiple third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for planned commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval.  We believe there are reliable sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates.  Our manufacturing strategy enables us to more efficiently direct financial resources to the research, development, and commercialization of product candidates rather than diverting resources to internally develop manufacturing facilities.  As our product candidates advance through development, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers and continue to strategically build redundancy in suppliers to fulfill and secure the ongoing and planned preclinical, clinical, and, if our product candidates are approved for marketing, commercial supply needs for ourselves and our collaborators.
 Manufacturing Preparations for Bardoxolone in Rare CKD
 Our manufacturing and quality teams are in place for the current stage of program development with plans to grow as needed to support commercial supply and distribution of bardoxolone, a small molecule drug product to be administered orally.  We are on track for planned NDA and commercial launch drug supplies, with an identified supply chain to adequately support near-term clinical and commercial demand.  We have completed process validation batches for drug substance and registration batches for drug product.  A three-year, room temperature shelf life is currently established for clinical-image bardoxolone capsules at multiple doses, which is anticipated to reflect commercial product.  In addition, we believe that the synthesis from regulatory starting material to drug substance can be manufactured at scale, resulting in a commercially competitive cost of goods.
 Manufacturing Preparations for Omaveloxolone in Neurological Diseases
 Our manufacturing and quality teams are in place for the current stage of program development with plans to grow as needed to support commercial supply and distribution of omaveloxolone, a small molecule drug product to be administered orally.  We are on track for planned NDA and commercial launch drug supplies, with an identified supply chain to adequately support near-term clinical and commercial demand.  We have completed registration batches for drug substance and drug product.  A three-year, room temperature, shelf life has been established for clinical-image omaveloxolone capsules at the target commercial dose.  In addition, we believe that the synthesis 
 26

from regulatory starting material to drug substance can be manufactured at scale, resulting in a commercially competitive cost of goods. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We are in the process of building the commercial infrastructure in the United States necessary to effectively support the commercialization of all our product candidates if and when regulatory approval of such product candidates in the United States appears imminent.  
 Outside of the United States, where appropriate and depending on the terms of our contractual arrangements, we plan, either alone, or with new collaboration partners, to commercialize our products.  Our strategic collaborator KKC has all rights to commercialization in its territories. We are refining our strategy and market assessments with respect to a potential launch in the EU, and we plan to continue to evaluate market opportunities for our products in other global markets.
 Commercial infrastructure for orphan products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support.  One challenge unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations.  Our management team is experienced in maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercialization purposes in rare diseases.
 Additional capabilities important to the orphan marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts.  To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved. 
 Sales and Marketing Preparations for Bardoxolone in Rare CKD 
 We are in the process of preparing for a potential commercial launch of bardoxolone in Alport syndrome in the United States.  Our ability to launch bardoxolone is dependent on the successful filing and defense of an NDA and approval by the FDA.  We have hired commercial leaders, and we are building the teams, infrastructure, systems, and processes necessary for the launch of bardoxolone in the United States, including sales, marketing, market access, patient support, and distribution.  Additionally, we are expanding quality and compliance functions to support commercialization.
 If we receive approval for bardoxolone in Alport syndrome, we plan to utilize a specialty pharmacy distribution model to support product availability to patients, with a patient-centered hub to support on-label utilization, ease of access, and patient education and compliance.  We have completed preliminary field force sizing and structure for sales and access teams.  The trade naming process is underway. We have launched disease awareness campaigns to educate physicians about Alport syndrome. 
 Sales and Marketing Preparations for Omaveloxolone in FA
 We are also in the process of preparing for a potential commercial launch of omaveloxolone in FA in the United States.  Our ability to launch omaveloxolone is dependent on the successful filing and defense of an NDA and approval by the FDA.  We have hired commercial leadership and are building the teams, infrastructure, systems, and processes necessary for the launch of omaveloxolone in the United States, including in sales, marketing, market access, patient support, and distribution.  Additionally, we are expanding quality and compliance functions to support commercialization.
 27

If we receive approval for omaveloxolone in FA, we plan to utilize a specialty pharmacy distribution model to support product availability to patients, with a patient-centered hub to support on-label utilization, ease of access, and patient education and compliance.  We have completed preliminary field force sizing and structure for sales and access teams.  The trade naming process is underway.  We have launched disease awareness campaigns to educate physicians about FA.
 Medical Affairs
 Our medical affairs activities grew in 2019 and are expected to continue to grow in 2020.  Regarding our CKD program, our medical science liaisons (MSLs) are actively engaged in educating the nephrology community on the hallmarks of Alport syndrome.  A focus of our education efforts is the importance of genetic testing in reducing the meaningful misdiagnosis rate for patients with Alport syndrome. Our KidneyCode™ initiative provides free access to genotyping against 17 CKD-relevant genes. In neurological disease, we are increasing our efforts to educate physicians on the hallmarks of FA and the differentiating symptoms that discriminate patients with FA from patients with similar neurological diseases.
Government Regulation 
 The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.  Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval may subject an applicant and sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the DOJ or other governmental entities.
United States Product Approval Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).  Pharmaceutical products are also subject to regulation by other governmental agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the EPA, and the DOJ.  The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:

• | Preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under good laboratory practice (GLPs);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before any human clinical trial commences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCPs);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The submission to the FDA of an NDA for the applicable small molecule drug product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA acceptance, review, and approval of the NDA (including the product labeling and package insert); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMPs).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate.  Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs.  The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which includes a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy determination.  The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the studies as outlined in the IND prior to that time.  In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed.  The IND must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidates to healthy human volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator.  Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial, and in accordance with protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.  Progress reports detailing the status of clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually.  Sponsors must also report in a timely manner to the FDA SAEs and unexpected AEs, any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected AEs over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or tests that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate.  Further, the protocol for each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB, either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted.  The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined and different studies may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or different patient populations.  These phases generally include the following:
 Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers.  In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for PD and PK properties such as safety (including adverse effects), dosage tolerability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.
 Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve a limited patient population to (1) preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerability and optimal dosage, and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 Phase 3. If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 trials, the clinical trial program may be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further evaluate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage, and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
 Phase 4. Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments.  Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval.
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.
 A pivotal trial is an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial that permits the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for labeling of the drug.  In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.  A 
 29

single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) in conjunction with confirmatory evidence.  The FDA may accept results from Phase 2 trials as pivotal if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
 The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a DSMB or committee.  This group determines whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.  A clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 The clinical trial process can take three to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product.
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition, and quality of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.  The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, currently approximately $2.9 million for fiscal year 2020.  The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies. 
 Review of Application
 Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review.  This is typically 12 months from the date of submission.  The review process is often extended by the FDA as a result of submission of additional information, sometimes at the FDA’s request, during the review.  The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with CGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity.  Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with CGMPs.  The FDA will also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of data supporting safety and efficacy.  During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product.  If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required.  A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval.  The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit, and interpretation of clinical trial data.  The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or the FDA requires additional testing or information.  The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.  The FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter detailing the deficiencies and information required for reconsideration of the application.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information.  Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration.  Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion.  Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial.  Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 30

The Orphan Drug Act
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.  Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.  After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.  The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication.  During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity.  Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.  Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits (Credits) for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity in an indication, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA in what is known as a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children.  The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, a sponsor would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA and conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA.  If there is no written agreement, studies would be conducted in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and reports submitted of those studies.  A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health.  The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request, agreement, or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration.  Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver.  The required assessment must include the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.  The FDA, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, may defer pediatric trial requirements for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations.  A deferral may be granted by the FDA if it believes that additional safety or effectiveness data in the adult population need to be collected before the pediatric studies begin.  The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.  Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted; however, beginning in 2020, PREA will apply to NDAs for orphan-designated drugs if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 The FDA is required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.  Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA 
 31

designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate.  The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs.  For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition.  The key benefits of fast track designation are rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval or approval on the basis of a surrogate endpoint, if relevant criteria are met.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.  Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
 Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at eight months after the NDA submission.  Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition.  If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of twelve months after NDA submission.  Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Even after approval, drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuous regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.  After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval.  There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA.  For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with CGMP requirements.  Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented.  FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from CGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.  Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain CGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.  Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may also result in revisions to the 
 32

approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program.  Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary product recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fines, untitled and warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market.  Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling.  The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) and Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA)
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors at the state level.  Under the PDMA and state law, states require the registration of manufacturers and distributors who provide pharmaceuticals in that state.  It also requires state licensing of manufacturers and distributors that ship pharmaceuticals into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state.  The PDMA and state laws impose requirements and limitations on drug sampling to ensure accountability in the distribution of samples.  The PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of these and other provisions.
 The DSCSA, signed into law on November 27, 2013, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, identification, verification, and other elements.  Among the requirements of this federal legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier (i.e., serialization) in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, and keep certain records regarding the drug product.  Further, under the DSCSA, manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.  These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period, and some requirements are already in effect.  The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations.  The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers.  These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by the FDA pursuant to the DSCSA.  Until the FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standards for wholesalers, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect, although the DSCSA expressly preempts those state statutes and regulations that require third-party logistics providers to maintain wholesale drug distributor licenses.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry.  These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.
 33

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs.  The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value.  The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to certain arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for a statutory exception or safe harbor protection.  Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.  Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.  Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.  Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.  The intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PPACA) to a lower intent standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or the specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.  In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below).  Further, civil monetary penalties statutes impose penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government.  As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government.  Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product.  Other pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services.  Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.  HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on certain types of entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information.  Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity.  HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  In addition, 
 34

state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.  This information is made publicly available on a searchable website.  Effective January 2022, information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives will also need to be reported.
 Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.  Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical trials.  Other states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states.  Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals.  Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases.  In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.  To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
 In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any approved products will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.  Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations.  Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs.
 Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.  Sales of our products will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors.  These third-party payors are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.  In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates.  The market for our products and product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement.  The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies.  Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.
 Because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unpredictable process.  We may be 
 35

required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.  This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenue and operating results.  We cannot be certain that our products and our product candidates will be considered cost-effective.  Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payor-by-payor basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payor does not guarantee that we will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payor.  If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product candidates from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them.  This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the EU and China, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control.  In some non- United States jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.  The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.  For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.  A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of a company placing the medicinal product on the market.  We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products.  In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could adversely affect our profitability.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to commercialize our products.  In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
 Furthermore, political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change.  Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform healthcare coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts.  We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals, limitations on rebate payments by drug manufacturers, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system.  Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.  For example, in March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law.  Among other cost containment measures, the PPACA established: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations.  The PPACA also expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, created a new Medicare Part D discount program, expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Services Pharmaceutical pricing program, and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.  In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, or which could otherwise affect our commercial operations and ability to be profitable.  If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business.  Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts.  Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible.  More recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax 
 36

Act) was signed into law, which eliminated certain requirements of the PPACA, including the individual mandate, and the current administration has further suggested that it may seek repeal of all or portions of the PPACA.  There is uncertainty with respect to the impact these changes, if any, may have, and any changes likely will take time to unfold.
 In addition, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted and created measures for spending reductions by Congress.  A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs.  These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013.  These reductions have been extended through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken.  Also, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of health care providers.
 Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the effect of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor, or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures.  Such policy actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.  For example, the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, contains a number of provisions related to the development of drug and biological products, including provisions intended to encourage the modernization of clinical trial design and support broader use of tools like biomarkers and methods to collect patient experience data.  While the 21st Century Cures Act is intended to make drug and biological product development less time-consuming and less costly, it does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality or quantity of evidence necessary to support approval.  In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2017 reauthorized and amended several drug provisions that were scheduled to sunset, such as the prescription drug user fee provisions, and made other changes to the FFDCA, including provisions related to development of pediatric drugs and access to generic drugs.  In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.  It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies, or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Foreign Regulation
 We are planning on seeking approval for our product candidates in Europe, Japan, and other countries.  To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy that govern, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products.  Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions.  Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of other countries in which we may seek approval, the approval process varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve different amounts of product testing and additional administrative review periods.  For example, in Europe, a sponsor must submit a clinical trial application (CTA), much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials.  A CTA must be submitted to each national health authority and an independent ethics committee.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as the countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.  The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from or be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval.  Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively affect the regulatory approval process in other countries.
 37

Our clinical trial programs and research collaborations may implicate international data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU.  The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018 and governs the collections and use of personal data in the EU.  The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several obligations and restrictions concerning the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, data breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data, and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations.  
 United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process.  The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an initial IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of the NDA and the approval of that product candidate application.  Patent term restoration cannot, however, extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date.  In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for any patent term extension or restoration.  In the future, we expect to apply for restoration of patent term for patents relating to each of our product candidates to add patent life beyond the current expiration date of such patents, depending on the length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA.  For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a five-year period of exclusivity to any approved NDA for a product containing a NCE, never previously approved by FDA either alone or in combination with another active moiety.  No application or an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) that references the NDA for the new chemical entity (NCE) may be submitted during the five-year exclusivity period, except that such applications may be submitted after four years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of the patents listed with the FDA for the innovator NDA.
 Foreign Country Data Exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for additional market exclusivity.  For example, in the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, an NCE generally receives eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity.  If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application.  During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates including patents claiming compositions of matter, therapeutic uses, distinct forms of specific compounds, formulations, manufacturing methods, and uses in specific indications and patient populations.  We are actively engaged in research to further develop and maintain our competitive position and may rely in part on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuous technological innovation to support and enhance our competitive position.
 We seek to protect and strengthen our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technologies, inventions, and any improvements that we consider important to the development and implementation of our business and strategy.  Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and technologies will depend, in part, on our success in obtaining and enforcing valid patent claims.  Additionally, we may benefit from a variety of regulatory frameworks in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, and other territories that provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for 
 38

qualifying drug products.  See “Business—Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”
 We cannot ensure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that may be filed by us in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our existing or subsequently granted patents will be useful in protecting our drug candidates, technological innovations, or processes.  Additionally, any existing or subsequently granted patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or infringed.  We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property rights or proprietary position will be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide or protect competitive advantages.  Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar products, or may be able to duplicate our technologies, business model, or strategy, without infringing our patents or otherwise using our intellectual property.
 Our patent estate (patents and patent applications owned by or exclusively licensed to Reata), on a worldwide basis, encompasses more than 900 granted patents and more than 260 pending patent applications, including more than 550 granted patents and more than 160 pending patent applications related to bardoxolone, omaveloxolone, RTA 901, and RTA 1701.  More than 200 granted patents and more than 50 pending applications claim additional structural classes of Nrf2 activators, providing further protection for the franchise and a potential source of additional development candidates.  Two issued United States patents, more than ten issued foreign patents, two pending United States patent applications, and a number of pending United States and foreign patent applications contain composition of matter claims to RTA 901 and related compounds.  RTA 1701 is covered by more than 40 granted United States and foreign patents and a number of pending applications.
 Our later-expiring granted patents with claims to compositions of matter for bardoxolone, including patents claiming the commercial form, have an expiration date of 2029 in the United States and 2028 elsewhere.  The patent that covers specific formulations of bardoxolone, including the commercial formulation, has an expiration date of 2030.  Other granted patents and pending patent applications relating to specific uses of bardoxolone, including the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH), PAH, and CKD, have expiration dates ranging from 2029 to 2034.  Fundamental composition of matter patents and applications claiming omaveloxolone have an expiration date in 2033.  These patents and applications also contain claims to therapeutic uses of omaveloxolone.  The fundamental United States composition of matter patent claiming RTA 901, and its foreign equivalents, have an expiration date in 2033.  Patents and pending applications covering RTA 1701, including composition of matter claims and method of use claims, have expiration dates ranging from 2031 to 2037.
 The protection afforded by any particular patent depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, scope of coverage encompassed by the granted claims, availability of extensions of patent term, availability of legal remedies in the particular territory in which the patent is granted, and success of any challenges to the patent, if asserted.  Changes in either patent laws or in the interpretation of patent laws in the United States and other countries could diminish our ability to protect our inventions and to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the enforceability of any granted patent claims or of any claims that may be granted from our patent applications.
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.  Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and core technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted.  We have in the past been involved in various administrative proceedings with respect to our patents and patent applications and may, as a result of our extensive portfolio, be involved in such proceedings in the future.  Additionally, in the future, we may claim that a third party infringes our intellectual property or a third party may claim that we infringe its intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable.  In any of the administrative proceedings or in litigation, we may incur significant expenses, damages, attorneys’ fees, costs of proceedings, and experts’ fees, and management and employees may be required to spend significant time in connection with these actions.
 39

Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that any patent related to our product candidates may expire before any of our product candidates can be commercialized or may remain in force for only a short period of time following commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage afforded by any such patent.
 The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below.
 Bardoxolone Patent Portfolio
 Our bardoxolone patent portfolio includes six families of granted United States patents, some with related applications pending, and two additional families of pending United States patent applications.  Granted and pending claims offer various forms of protection for bardoxolone including claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, specific forms (such as crystalline or non-crystalline forms), specific formulations, and methods for treating a variety of diseases, including PAH and CKD, using bardoxolone or its analogs.  These United States patents and applications, and their foreign equivalents, are described in more detail below.
 There are two families of composition of matter patents containing claims that cover bardoxolone.  The original patent family containing claims to bardoxolone and related compounds was filed in 1999 and exclusively licensed to Reata in 2004 (see “Business—Intellectual Property—Licenses”).  Exclusive of any patent term extension, one granted United States patent from this family containing claims covering bardoxolone has an expiration date in 2022.  Corresponding patents granted in Canada, Europe (validated in multiple European Patent Convention (EPC) member states), and Japan expired in 2019.  Exclusive of any patent term extension, the granted United States patents containing claims covering specific forms of bardoxolone, including the commercial form, are due to expire in 2028 or 2029.  Two corresponding regional patents have been granted in Europe and each is validated in multiple EPC member states.  Additional corresponding patents have been granted in Japan, China, Canada, and several other countries, and related applications provide broad international protection in additional territories worldwide.  Exclusive of any patent term extension, these granted foreign patents and pending patent applications, if granted, are due to expire in 2028.
 In some cases, granted United States patents claiming bardoxolone have a longer statutory term than the corresponding foreign patents.  This results from the USPTO’s practice of granting patent term adjustments for examination delays originating at the USPTO.  Such adjustments are generally not available under foreign patent laws.  If bardoxolone is approved for marketing in the United States, under the Hatch-Waxman Act we may be eligible for up to five years patent term extension for a granted United States patent containing claims covering bardoxolone.  Similar term extensions may be available in Europe, Japan, Australia, and certain other foreign jurisdictions.  The amount of any such term extension, and the identity of the patent to which it would apply, are dependent upon several factors including the duration of the development program and the date of marketing approval.  See “Business—Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”

Omaveloxolone Patent Portfolio
 Omaveloxolone is protected by three families of patents.  The first, filed in April 2009, contains composition of matter claims that encompass omaveloxolone and many related compounds.  This family includes five issued United States patents and a number of granted patents in foreign jurisdictions including China, Mexico, and Japan.  Additional United States and foreign applications from this family are pending.  The second family, filed in April 2013, is specifically focused on omaveloxolone and includes composition of matter claims and method of use claims.  The initial United States patent from this family was issued on March 31, 2015.  The issued claims include composition of matter claims to omaveloxolone without regard to morphic form, claims to several distinct morphic forms of omaveloxolone, including the form used in oral dosing formulations, and claims to various methods of therapeutic use.  A first continuation application has also issued, and a second continuation application is pending.  Foreign equivalents of the original United States application have been filed in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, and more than 20 other territories.  The European application has granted and has been validated in multiple EPC member states.  In addition, a divisional application has been filed in Europe.  The Japanese and Chinese applications have also granted.  A third patent family, filed by AbbVie in April 2014 and licensed to us under the Reacquisition Agreement, claims additional morphic forms of omaveloxolone.
 The most relevant granted United States patents with claims covering omaveloxolone are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates.  As discussed above for bardoxolone, if omaveloxolone is approved for marketing in the United States, we may be eligible for term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a granted United States patent containing claims covering omaveloxolone.  Similar term extensions may be available in Europe, Japan, and certain other foreign jurisdictions.  The amount of any such term extension, and the identity of the patent to which it would apply, are dependent upon several factors including the duration of the development program and the date of marketing approval.

Trade Secrets and Know-How
 Certain aspects of our activities, such as our research and manufacturing efforts, rely in part on proprietary know-how or trade secrets.  Because we may employ third-party contractors to conduct certain aspects of those activities and because we collaborate with various organizations and academic institutions on the advancement of our technology platform, we must at times share trade secrets with them.  We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements, or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees, and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information.  These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets.  Despite these contractual provisions, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements.  Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.  We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 Licenses
 2004 Dartmouth and MD Anderson License
 In 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System in which we obtained from the Trustees of Dartmouth College (Dartmouth) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson), an exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license to compounds, including bardoxolone, and claims in certain patents and patent applications, along with associated know-how, to manufacture, have manufactured, use and sell defined licensed products for use within the field of human therapeutic and diagnostic uses, research reagents, and veterinary uses.  Dartmouth and MD Anderson retain certain limited rights related to academic research and educational use of these compounds, and the United States government retains certain limited rights.
 Under the terms of this license, we paid an initial licensing fee and sunk-in patent costs and are required to pay annual license maintenance fees.  In addition, the license requires us to pay certain development milestone payments depending on the licensed indication, a portion of sublicensing revenue received by us from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at percentages between mid-teen digits and low-single digits, and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees subject to specified annual minimums.  To date, we have made $26.7 million in development and sublicense payments under the license.
 42

We have a continuing obligation to use best efforts to commercialize the licensed technology.  The license is effective until the last expiration of a claim in a licensed patent that covers the licensed product or 20 years if no licensed patent covers the licensed product.  The license can be terminated by the licensors for our material breach subject to a specified notice and cure period based on the nature of the breach, if we become insolvent or enter bankruptcy or receivership proceedings, if we fail to provide satisfactory evidence that we are exercising best efforts to commercialize a licensed invention, or if two payments are late or unpaid within a twelve-month period.  Upon any termination of the license, we grant licensors a non-exclusive, sublicenseable license to any improvements that we make to the licensed technology, including those that we license from third parties, subject to a mutually agreed royalty.
 2012 Amendment to the 2004 Dartmouth and MD Anderson License
 In July 2012, the parties executed an amendment to the 2004 license.  This amendment provides, among other terms, that we will pay to the licensors a low single-digit royalty on net sales of certain Nrf2 activator compounds under the Collaboration Agreement, including omaveloxolone, that are claimed in certain patents and patent applications that are wholly owned by or assigned to us as identified in the Collaboration Agreement.
 2009 Dartmouth License
 In 2009, we entered into an agreement with Dartmouth, pursuant to which Dartmouth granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable license to Dartmouth’s rights in patents and patent applications jointly owned by us and Dartmouth claiming the use of bardoxolone and related compounds in the treatment of renal, cardiovascular, and certain metabolic diseases, along with associated know-how, to make, have made, use and sell defined licensed products in the licensed field.  Dartmouth retains certain limited rights related to academic research and educational use of these compounds.
 Under the terms of this license, we paid to Dartmouth an initial licensing fee and we are required to pay annual maintenance fees and payments associated with the achievement of certain development and aggregate sales milestones.  In addition, Dartmouth is entitled to receive from us a portion of our sublicensing revenue from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at a percentage in the low single digits, and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees.  To date, we have made $10.9 million in development and sublicense payments under the license.
 We are obligated to exert commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize and effectively manufacture and market licensed products, including, targeting certain development milestones specified in the agreement.
 The license is effective until the last valid claim of the licensed patents in the territory expires.  Each party has the right to terminate the license for the other party’s material breach, subject to a specified notice and cure period.  The license terminates automatically in the event that we become insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or file for bankruptcy.
 2014 University of Kansas Licenses
 In September 2014, we entered into two exclusive, worldwide license agreements with KU Center for Technology Commercialization, Inc., the manager of intellectual property owned by University of Kansas and the University of Kansas Medical Center (the University of Kansas), to compounds claimed in certain patents and patent applications either owned exclusively by the University of Kansas or owned jointly by the University of Kansas and the National Institutes of Health (the NIH) that act as small molecule modulators of heat shock protein activity and responses in all human and veterinary therapeutic and diagnostic uses.
 Under the terms of these licenses, we paid the University of Kansas initial licensing fees and reimbursed University of Kansas for past patent expenses incurred.  Under each agreement, we are required to pay annual license maintenance fees, are obligated to spend a specified threshold for sponsored research to be performed by the University of Kansas, and are obligated to pay University of Kansas development and regulatory milestone 
 43

payments for each of the first two products and sales milestone payments only on the first product developed.  Under each agreement the University of Kansas is entitled to receive from us a portion of any sublicensing revenue we receive from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at a percentage ranging from the low single digits to the low thirties depending on the stage of development at the time the sublicense is granted.  Under each agreement, the University of Kansas is entitled to receive royalties on net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees at a percentage ranging in the low single digits depending on the type of licensed product, subject to minimum annual royalties.  To date, we have made $0.7 million in development and sublicense payments under these licenses.  Under each license agreement we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, and market at least one licensed compound.  Additionally, under each license agreement, the University of Kansas retains limited rights related to research and educational use of these compounds, and the United States government also retains certain limited rights related to these compounds arising from federal funding of the research that led to their discovery.  Under one agreement, the NIH retains limited rights related to research and educational use of compounds claimed in patents that name NIH as an assignee.
 Each license agreement is effective on a per-country basis until the later of: (i) the last expiration of a claim in a licensed patent that covers the licensed product in such country; (ii) ten years from first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country; or (iii) the expiration of any period of regulatory exclusivity for a licensed product that bars the entry of generic competitors in such country.
 Each license agreement can be terminated by the University of Kansas if we fail to make required payments or reports, fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize a licensed product, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, enter into receivership or a composition with creditors, or fail to perform certain other obligations including the achievement of certain developmental milestones within specified time limits, and we fail to cure any such breach within 30 days of receiving a notice of default from the licensors.
 Third-Party Filings
 A number of United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products.  Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that, if granted, could pose an infringement risk with respect to our use of our product candidates or proprietary technologies.
 If a third party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including but not limited to litigation expenses, substantial damages, attorney fees, injunction, royalty payments, cross-licensing of our patents, redesign of our products or processes, and related fees and costs.
 We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our products, product candidates, and proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights.  If one of these patents were to be found to cover our products, product candidates, proprietary technologies, or their uses, we could be required to pay damages and could be restricted from commercializing our products, product candidates, or using our proprietary technologies unless we obtain a license to the patent.  A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.  In addition, during litigation, the patent holder might obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable right, which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, technologies, or methods.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, we had 220 full-time employees, 59 of whom held Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 145 of whom were engaged in research and development, and 75 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources, legal functions, or administrative support.  None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and none of our employees has entered into a collective agreement with us.  We consider our employee relations to be good.
 44

Facilities
 Our principal executive offices are located in Plano, Texas, where we lease approximately 122,000 square feet of office space.  We also lease approximately 34,890 square feet of additional office and laboratory space in Irving, Texas.  Our leases expire in April 2022 with four successive three-month-period renewal options and October 2022 with an option to renew up to six months, respectively.  On October 15, 2019, we entered into a lease agreement with TC Legacy Land Venture, LLC (the 2019 Lease Agreement), to lease a single-tenant and build-to-suit building of approximately 327,400 square feet of office and laboratory space located in Plano, Texas with an initial lease term of 16 years with an option to renew up to ten years.  We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space would be available if needed.
