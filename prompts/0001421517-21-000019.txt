Item 1 — Business
Overview
Energy Recovery, Inc. (the “Company”, “Energy Recovery”, “we”, “our” and “us”) creates technologies that solve complex challenges for industrial fluid-flow markets worldwide. Building on our pressure exchanger technology platform, we design and manufacture solutions that improve operational efficiency by reducing waste, energy consumption and costs across a range of industrial processes. What began as a game-changing invention for desalination has grown into a global business advancing the environmental sustainability of customers’ operations in multiple industries.

We were incorporated in Virginia in 1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our headquarters and principal research and development (“R&D”), and manufacturing facility is located in San Leandro, California.
Engineering and R&D have been, and remain, an essential part of our history, culture and corporate strategy. Since our formation, we have developed leading technology and engineering expertise through the continual evolution of our pressure exchanger technology, which can improve productivity by reducing waste and energy consumption in high-pressure industrial fluid-flow systems. This versatile technology powers several of our products, including our flagship PX® Pressure Exchanger® (“PX”) energy recovery device (“ERD”), which we believe is the industry standard for energy recovery in the seawater reverse osmosis desalination (“SWRO”) industry. Today, we continue to push the boundaries of our pressure exchanger technology to handle different operating environments and industrial applications. 
 Our pressure exchanger technology efficiently transfers energy between high-pressure and low-pressure liquid or gas through continuously rotating ducts. Our PX can operate in both low-pressure and high-pressure environments, between 1,000 pounds per square inch (“psi”), or 70 bar, and up to approximately 10,000 psi, or 700 bar. Our pressure exchanger technology can also handle a variety of relatively clean to dirty liquids, and we are actively developing capabilities to handle gases. 

In January 2020, we opened our Katy, Texas facility for manufacturing, testing and training. In July 2020, we commissioned our manufacturing and warehousing space located in Tracy, California, which supplements the existing manufacturing, warehousing and distribution of our ERDs. We are a global team with sales and on-site technical support available worldwide, and we maintain international direct sales offices and technical support centers to service Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Environmental, Social & Governance Program
In September 2020, we released our first Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) report, detailing our multi-pronged approach to enhancing sustainability, managing and mitigating ESG related risks, and working to continually improve our company in each of the three ESG areas. While our business and products have always centered on helping our customers achieve more efficient, sustainable operations, our enhanced focus today on ESG, and related stakeholder engagement, positions us to improve our sustainability while also taking a more strategic and defined role in the global effort to create a more sustainable future. With our growing business and expanding global footprint, we believe it is time to formalize our commitment to increasing the resiliency and sustainability of our business.
In addition to focusing on how our innovative products can create a more sustainable future, we see an opportunity to build a better company for our shareholders, customers and employees, and the world. Nearly 90% of our product revenue in fiscal year 2019, the reporting year of our first ESG report, came from renewable and energy efficiency-related products. On average, our products had lowered energy expenses for our desalination customers by $2 billion per year and helped these customers avoid 21 terawatt hours annually, an amount associated with preventing approximately 12.4 million metric tons of carbon emissions – equivalent to removing more than 2.5 million passenger vehicles from the road annually. In addition, we have historically focused on recycling raw materials in our manufacturing processes. In fiscal year 2019, 96% of our PXs shipped to our customers contained components made from recycled materials.
We pride ourselves on creating products and solutions that address climate change, sustainable industrialization, energy efficiency, and water scarcity. Ultimately, we believe that the integration of ESG principles into our corporate and risk management strategies can strengthen our existing business as well as our efforts to develop new applications of pressure exchanger technology for high-pressure and low-pressure fluid-flow environments.
Our ESG report, in its entirety, can be found on our website at https://ir.energyrecovery.com/websites/energyrecover/English/6500/esg-at-energy-recovery.html.

COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”), a pandemic which has resulted in authorities across the globe implementing numerous measures to contain the virus. In response to measures taken by federal, state and local governments, we have instituted the government minimum masking standards as well as provided enhanced safety measures above and beyond the government minimum, including shift configurations that ensure social distancing between workers, personal safety equipment for each worker, such as gloves, cleanings between shifts, weekly testing of employees and vendors working on site, and limited office activities to essential personnel. In addition, we implemented, where feasible, a work-at-home policy, to allow for continued operation of all support functions. These enhanced safety measures allow us to help contain the spread of COVID-19 and to ensure the health and safety of our employees. Despite a majority of our production staff working on-site since June 2020, we have had no known cases of communal spread of COVID-19 at our facilities.
We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our long-term financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows due to uncertainties. Based on current projections, which are subject to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures and the effect of these on the industries in which we compete, we believe our cash on hand and marketable securities, as well as our ongoing cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to cover our capital requirements for the next 12 months from the issuance of this annual report.
For a discussion of the key trends and uncertainties that have affected our revenues, income and liquidity, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Markets
We are a market leader in the engineering, design, manufacturing, and supply of ERDs and related equipment, and services to the global SWRO desalination market. Leveraging our proven pressure exchanger technology, we are also focused on developing and delivering new solutions for markets outside of seawater desalination, including industrial wastewater, natural gas processing and hydraulic fracturing. We believe our pressure exchanger technology can address inefficiencies and waste within industrial systems and processes that involve high-pressure and low-pressure fluid flows.
Our company was founded to solve energy waste problems in the water desalination industry, which remains our primary source of revenue and profitability. The world’s need for clean water is intensifying, driven by population growth, industrialization, rapid urbanization, and climate change. According to the United Nations’ estimates, the world will only have 60% of the potable water it needs by 2030, and global demand will surge 30% by 2050, further outstripping supply. Apart from seasonal variations, the supply of fresh water generally remains fixed and is decreasing in some geographic areas. These trends make desalinating or filtering seawater, brackish water and the treatment and re-use of industrial wastewater, increasingly vital to satisfy global water demand.
We offer a suite of products for the SWRO desalination and industrial wastewater treatment industries, including ERDs and high-pressure feed pumps and high-pressure recirculation pumps. In addition, we sell a solution to reduce energy consumption in natural gas processing and are developing a new solution to reduce waste, redundancy and indirectly lower emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing.
Seawater Desalination
Reverse osmosis (“RO”) is the preferred technology in most desalination applications, and we deliver efficient, scalable solutions for recovering otherwise wasted energy in the process, thereby allowing our customers to reduce their capital expenditures, as well as lowering operating costs and reducing carbon emissions associated with the production of clean water. We also offer high-pressure multi- and single-stage centrifugal pumps designed to complement our ERDs for a wide range of RO plant capacities.

Solutions
Our ERDs are categorized into two technology groups: positive displacement isobaric ERDs, such as our flagship PX, which is generally used in SWRO, and centrifugal-type ERDs, such as our hydraulic turbochargers (“Turbochargers”), which are used primarily in brackish water reverse osmosis (“BWRO”) desalination.
Prior to the introduction of ERDs, the SWRO process was often cost prohibitive when compared to more traditional water treatment processes due to the high energy needs required by the process. Generally speaking, energy intensive pumps are used to pressurize feed waters with varying concentrations of salts, minerals and contaminants, which is then forced through a semi-permeable membrane to achieve the desired water quantity and quality. The SWRO process results in fresh water, suitable for potable, agricultural and industrial use and a concentrated and pressurized concentrate or brine stream. Prior to the adoption of ERDs, the concentrated residual pressure energy was dissipated through a throttle valve before the fluid was returned to the ocean. The pressurization of the feed water and subsequent dissipation of the pressure energy in the discharge water was inefficient and resulted in tremendous amounts of wasted pressure energy that made SWRO substantially more expensive than alternative water production options.
When introduced, ERDs fundamentally altered this paradigm by capturing and reusing this wasted pressure energy. The Pelton wheel was one of the first ERDs, followed by the development of hydraulic turbochargers, both of which provide suboptimal efficiencies in the reuse of wasted pressure energy. In the late 1990s, our PX was introduced, delivering efficiencies up to 98%. Rather than dissipating or “wasting” the pressure energy from the discharge brine, our PX, which is the most widely used energy recovery solution, can transfer the pressure energy from the discharge water directly to a portion of the low-pressure filtered feed water, thereby reducing the amount of flow required by the main high-pressure processes’ pumps. This results in a much more efficient process as the size of the high-pressure pumps and the corresponding energy usage can be reduced by up to 60%. As a result, our PXs have helped make SWRO desalination an economically viable and more sustainable option in the production of potable water.
The BWRO process is essentially the same as the SWRO process. Brackish water typically has lower salt, mineral and contaminant content than seawater, therefore, fewer solids need to be removed and less energy is expended on pressurizing the feed water. The amount of salts in the feed water will ultimately determine the system design and operating conditions which, in turn, will drive decisions related to the specification or type of ERD to be employed, if any. Due to the lower cost and available pressure energy involved, our Turbochargers generally have characteristics more applicable to the BWRO process. The BWRO process is typically focused on maximizing membrane recovery and thus reducing the amount of brine generated throughout the process. In doing so, multiple membrane stages and “interstage boost” designs are being widely used which can incorporate our Turbocharger ERDs.
PX, high efficiency isobaric ERDs. Our patented PX family of products, which includes the 4S series, 65 series and PX Q300, leverages our pressure exchanger technology. In this application, the pressure exchanger used in the PX products is made of a ceramic rotor supported by a highly efficient hydrodynamic and hydrostatic bearing system. All products in this family are designed for use in the SWRO industry, or in higher salinity BWRO applications, and enable desalination plant operators to recover otherwise wasted hydraulic pressure energy from a high-pressure fluid flow and transfer the energy to a low-pressure fluid flow, reducing energy costs and carbon emissions associated with the SWRO and BWRO processes.
Turbochargers, high efficiency centrifugal ERD. Our Turbochargers consist of a single-stage turbine runner connected to a single-stage pump impeller via a common shaft. All hydraulics are housed within the casing, with no seals required. The turbine runner absorbs the hydraulic energy of the concentrate stream and converts it into mechanical energy. This energy is then transferred to the pump impeller. The impeller converts the mechanical energy back to hydraulic energy, providing an additional pressure boost to the feed stream of the BWRO or SWRO desalination systems. Our Turbochargers are used for both low-pressure BWRO and high-pressure SWRO systems, as well as various other water treatment applications. Our AT and LPT Turbocharger product lines provide high efficiency with state-of-the-art engineering utilizing a compact configuration. We believe our Turbochargers deliver substantial savings and ease of integration into desalination systems. With custom-designed hydraulics that allow for optimum performance over a wide range of operating conditions, our Turbocharger technology offers solutions to capital cost constrained single-stage SWRO applications, as well as inter-stage boost desalination applications typically found in BWRO systems.
Pumps. High efficiency pumps, high-pressure feed and high-pressure circulation pumps. In addition to ERDs, SWRO desalination requires specialized high-pressure membrane feed and, in PX applications, high-pressure circulation pumps. These devices, in combination with ERDs, must efficiently pressurize and circulate feed water to the membranes to purify water. Plant operators require specialized pumps with performance matched to the requirements of the membranes and ERDs. To minimize plant costs, these pumps must provide high energy efficiency and reliability with low maintenance requirements.

Table of Contents

We manufacture and/or supply specialized high-pressure feed and circulation pumps for only a portion of the markets served by our ERD solutions. Our high-pressure feed pumps are designed to pressurize the membrane feed flow and overcome the osmotic pressure requirements of the feed water resulting in the production of permeate water. Our high-pressure circulation pumps are designed to “circulate” and control the high pressure flow through our PX and to compensate for small pressure losses across the membranes, PX and associated process piping.
Markets
SWRO and BWRO have been our primary markets for revenue generation. The water market ranges from small desalination plants, such as those used in cruise ships and resorts, to megaproject scale desalination plants, defined as those which produce over 50,000 cubic meters of water per day (“m3/day”). Because of the geographical location of many significant water desalination projects, geopolitical and economic events can influence the timing of expected projects. We anticipate that markets traditionally not associated with desalination, including the United States of America (“U.S.”), will inevitably develop and provide further revenue growth opportunities.
Greenfield. The greenfield market represents newly constructed RO desalination projects. These facilities vary in size, scope and geography. Large scale greenfield projects are typically public in nature and involve a formal tendering process. Smaller greenfield projects may be private in nature, but typically still involve a formal tendering process. We work directly with the project bidders, generally large engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) firms, end-users and industry consultants, to specify our products prior to the project being awarded, where possible. Once the project is awarded to an EPC firm, our normal sales process ensues. The greenfield market has been the key market for our water business. This market is highly competitive, and the tendering process pays close attention to the cost to desalinate water (i.e., dollars per cubic meter of water produced). Our PX’s industry-leading efficiency for ERDs in the desalination industry has allowed us to remain a market leader in the global ERD market.
Retrofit (or Brownfield). The retrofit market represents existing water facilities that are currently in operation utilizing legacy ERD technologies, alternative technologies or no ERDs at all. These facilities and their owners not only face higher energy consumption and reduced plant availability due to these legacy technologies, but also encounter capital expenditure and “know-how” issues that may prevent them from retrofitting plants. Typical retrofits include improvements to existing operations, equipment upgrades and potential expansions of existing capacity. We leverage our best-in-class solutions and “know how” to unseat legacy technology in Brownfield plants by implementing water production efficiency measures to reduce overall power consumption, repair and maintenance costs and avoid costly capital upgrades, as well as increase throughput and/or plant uptime. These retrofit opportunities may or may not have a formal tendering process. We typically approach the plant operators, owners and/or end-users of these facilities to present our leading life-cycle cost value-proposition.
Technology Conversion
The thermal desalination process was the dominant seawater desalination technology employed throughout the 1990’s. In this process, thermal energy is used to evaporate water from heated seawater and subsequently condense the vapor to produce pure water. Starting in the early 1990’s, due to many factors including the introduction and greater usage of ERDs, the process of choice for the desalination industry shifted from thermal to membrane based RO desalination. 
Over the past decade RO desalination technology became the predominant technology, supplanting thermal desalination technology as today’s desalination technology of choice. From 1980 through 2019, over 22 million m3/day of potable or desalinated water capacity was installed with much of the older capacity utilizing thermal technology. As water desalination plants that use the thermal desalination technology age, the industry expects the majority of these plant owners to replace their existing thermal technology with RO technology. These conversions are driving new demand for RO process equipment, which creates demand for our products.
Service & Aftermarket
Service & aftermarket is comprised of existing water facilities that have our solutions installed and in operation. We provide spare parts and repair services, field services and various commissioning activities to our global customer base. We leverage our industry expertise in supporting our existing installed base to ensure that our solutions are being operated effectively and efficiently. Readily available aftermarket products and services are required by our industry partners and customers in order to maximize plant availability and overall profitability of their operations.

Customers 
We separate our sales into three distinct channels due to financial and other commercial and technical aspects of the projects. We identify these sales channels as megaproject (“MPD”), original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) and aftermarket (“AM”). 
Megaproject. MPD customers are major firms that develop, design, build, own and/or operate large-scale desalination plants. A significant portion of our revenue has historically come from these customers. Our MPD customers have the required desalination expertise to engineer, undertake procurement for, construct, and sometimes own and operate, large-scale desalination plants or megaprojects. Due to the project structures and capacities of these megaprojects, ongoing operating costs and life cycle costs, rather than the initial capital expenditures is the key factor in the MPD customers’ selection of an ERD solution. As such, MPD customers most often select our PX, which we believe offers market-leading value with the highest technological and economic benefit. We work with these MPD customers to specify and optimize our PX solutions for their plant designs. The average time between project tender and shipment ranges from 16 to 36 months, or more. Each megaproject represents revenue opportunities ranging from approximately $1 million to $18 million. We estimate that the total capital investments by MPD customers in these large-scale infrastructure projects may range between $50 million to over $1 billion.
Original Equipment Manufacturer. OEM customers are companies that supply equipment, packaged systems, and various operating and maintenance solutions for small to medium-sized desalination plants, utilized by commercial and industrial entities, as well as national, state and local municipalities worldwide. We sell to our OEM customers a broad set of our products, including our PX, Turbochargers, high-pressure pumps and circulation “booster” pumps, and associated services. OEM projects comprise of desalination plants processing up to 50,000 m3/day, such as desalination plants located in local municipalities, hotels and resorts, power plants, cruise ships, and farm operations, among others. In addition, these OEM customers purchase our solutions for mobile, decentralized “quick water” or emergency water solutions. Unlike megaprojects, OEM projects are smaller in scope and, as such, the initial capital expenditure, rather than future ongoing operating costs, is often more of a factor in selection of an ERD solution. Accordingly, we sell not only our PX, but also our Turbochargers, which offer a lower cost alternative to our PX. The typical OEM project timeline from project tender to shipment ranges from one to 12 months. Each OEM project typically represents revenue opportunities up to $1 million. We estimate that the total capital investments by OEM customers in these projects are typically up to $50 million.
Aftermarket. AM customers are desalination plant owners and/or operators who can utilize our technology to upgrade or keep their plant running. Our existing and expanding installed base of ERDs and pump products in water plants has created a growing AM customer base comprised of plant operators and service providers. These AM customers purchase spare parts, replacement parts, and service contracts, as well as utilize our field service expertise to perform maintenance and repairs.
Competition 
The market for ERDs, Turbochargers, high-pressure pumps, and circulation “booster” pumps, is competitive. As the demand for fresh water increases and the market expands, we expect competition to persist and intensify.
We have three main competitors for our ERDs: Flowserve Corporation (“Flowserve”); Fluid Equipment Development Company (“FEDCO”); and Danfoss Group (“Danfoss”). We believe our solutions offer a competitive advantage compared to our competitors’ solutions because our ERDs provide the lowest life-cycle cost and are, therefore, the most cost-effective ERD solutions for the RO desalination application.
In the market for large megaprojects, our PX competes primarily with Flowserve’s DWEER product. We believe our PX has a competitive advantage, as compared to the DWEER product, because our devices are made with highly durable and corrosion-resistant aluminum oxide (“alumina”) ceramic parts that are designed for a life of more than 25 years, are warrantied for high efficiencies, and cause minimal unplanned downtime, resulting in lower lifecycle costs. Additionally, our PX offers optimum scalability with a quick startup, as well as no scheduled maintenance.
In the market for small- to medium-sized desalination plants, our ERD solutions compete with FEDCO’s turbochargers and Danfoss’ iSave ERD. We believe that our PX has a distinct competitive advantage over these solutions because our devices provide up to 98% efficiency, have lower lifecycle maintenance costs, and are made of highly durable and corrosion-resistant alumina ceramic parts. We also believe that our Turbochargers compete favorably with FEDCO’s turbochargers based on efficiency, price, and because our Turbochargers have design advantages that enhance efficiency, operational flexibility and serviceability.

Table of Contents

In the applicable market and flow ranges that we serve for high-pressure pumps and circulation pumps, our solutions compete with pumps manufactured by FEDCO, Flowserve, KSB Aktiengesellschaft, Torishima Pump Mfg. Co., Ltd., Sulzer Pumps, Ltd., and other companies. We believe that our pump solutions are competitive with these solutions because our pumps are developed specifically for RO desalination, are highly efficient, feature product-lubricated bearings, and are often purchased with our ERDs in small to medium-sized plants.
Sales and Marketing
Our strategically located direct sales force offers our products through capital sale to our customers around the world. We have sales offices in the U.S.; Madrid, Spain; Shanghai, Peoples Republic of China; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and we maintain a sales and service footprint in strategic territories, allowing rapid response to our customers’ needs. Our team is composed of individuals with many years of desalination and water industry expertise. Aligning to the geographic breadth of our current and potential future customers, our product marketing approach includes a strategic presence at water industry events across various regions. In addition, we leverage our industry and market intelligence to develop new solutions and services that can be adopted by our growing customer base.
A significant portion of our revenue is from outside of the U.S. Additional segment and geographical information regarding our product revenue is included in Note 2, “Revenue,” Note 12, “Segment Reporting,” and Note 13, “Concentrations,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
There is no specific seasonality to highlight that occurs throughout a calendar year. We often experience substantial fluctuations in product revenue from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year because a single order for our ERDs by MPD customers for a particular plant is based upon each customer’s project planning, which varies from year to year.
Emerging Technologies
Over the past few years, our oil & gas R&D efforts have largely focused on the development of applications of our technology for the oil & gas market, which includes hydraulic fracturing and natural gas processing, as well as expanding the technical aperture of the pressure exchanger technology to unlock future commercial opportunities. We have since identified multiple markets that would be enhanced by applying our pressure exchanger technology and have begun disciplined R&D efforts in these areas. All of these R&D efforts are geared towards unlocking future commercial opportunities.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Oilfield service operators, our targeted customers, have long sought ways to ruggedize or extend the life of pumps, thereby reducing costs in both the hydraulic fracturing and drilling processes. We believe the most efficient method of extending the life of these pumps is to isolate the high-pressure pumps from the abrasive fluids completely, thereby enabling these operators to realize immediate and long-term savings in the form of reduced downtime, repairs and maintenance costs and capital equipment redundancy.
Our in-development VorTeq technology, a pressure exchanger-based solution for hydraulic fracturing, seeks to reduce equipment failure common during well completion operations by re-routing the abrasive proppants that can cause pump failure away from fracturing pumps, and ultimately enabling a more efficient pumping model. The pressure exchanger technology at the heart of the VorTeq works as a pump. Fracturing fluid is pressurized in the VorTeq before being sent downhole. This process ensures that high-pressure fracturing pumps handle water, not abrasive proppants, protecting the fracturing pumps from erosion and reducing operational downtime. Our goal for the VorTeq is to allow site operators to reduce repair and maintenance costs, reduce capital costs by extending the fracturing pump’s life expectancy, and eliminate redundant capital equipment. By minimizing the fracturing pump redundancy and increasing equipment lifespan, the VorTeq could lower costs and reduce the resources required for oil & gas well completion operations. This in turn would indirectly lower emissions associated with manufacturing and transporting spare parts. Increasing equipment lifespan can also help reduce safety risks exposure related to equipment failures on site. We continue to work with our partner and other potential customers to commercialize the VorTeq. In early fiscal year 2021, we began testing the VorTeq in the field at live wells, an important step towards commercialization.

Natural Gas Processing
Natural gas is typically processed by removing acid gases, such as carbon dioxide (“CO2”) and hydrogen sulfide before it is ready for distribution and use. A common acid gas removal process uses an amine solvent to absorb acid gases in a high-pressure contactor column. Having absorbed the CO2 and hydrogen sulfide, the pressurized (rich) amine is then depressurized and processed into regenerated (lean) amine for reuse. Our technology has enabled gas processing plant owners and operators, our targeted customers, to achieve immediate and long-term energy savings with little or no operational disruption. Our IsoBoost™ product, an ERD solution based on our Turbocharger technology, can recover the energy wasted during the depressurization of the amine. This recovery of amine pressure energy allows the use of fewer high-pressure pumps which reduces energy consumption and thereby the carbon footprint of the plant, capital expenditures, and energy and maintenance costs. In addition, reduced downtime and maintenance can positively impact plant availability. Within the gas processing, the IsoBoost technology enables the recovery of pressure energy in the fluid flows either through the exchange of pressure within the application or by converting it to electricity. 
Our first major purchase order for multiple units of our IsoBoost for integration into a major gas processing plant occurred in 2016. This plant, located in Saudi Arabia, was recently commissioned in the Spring of 2020. After receiving positive results from the implementation of our IsoBoost into this plant, we have begun to focus our efforts on selling our IsoBoost to customers we have identified in the North American market.
Several companies manufacture hydraulic turbochargers, which could eventually develop into competitive technology to our IsoBoost. However, none of the companies that currently manufacture turbochargers have significant experience within gas processing. In order to utilize a turbocharger in gas processing, expertise is required to validate the system level design and integration within a gas processing application.
Industrial Wastewater
An adjacent water market we serve is the industrial wastewater treatment market. In this market, ultra high-pressure reverse osmosis (“UHPRO”) is often utilized with other technologies to recover clean water from an industrial wastewater stream and concentrate pollutants to a level where they can be economically utilized or safely disposed, rather than reintroduced into waterways. Many industrial wastewater treatment plants can concentrate the dissolved pollutants to an extent that they produce zero liquid discharge (“ZLD”). These treatment facilities are often associated with the mining, textile, pulp and paper, power generation, and chemical manufacturing industries.
As fresh water sources continue to decline and population and industrial growth intensify the need for clean water, ZLD and minimal liquid discharge (“MLD”) is of growing importance for the global water industry, which is increasingly prioritizing the reuse and recycling of existing water sources and the reduction of pollution levels. China and India are two countries that have mandated ZLD and MLD requirements for industry in the future, and we expect this trend to expand and grow throughout the world in response to the growing gap between water availability and water demand.
In 2020, we introduced the Ultra PX™ ERD, which we believe addresses key challenges, such as energy intensity and environmental impacts, associated with treating industrial wastewater in UHPRO applications. Designed with the pressure exchanger technology that powers our PX ERD for SWRO, the Ultra PX functions similarly to our PX ERD but can withstand higher pressures of up to 1,740 psi, or 120 bar. The Ultra PX recovers up to 60 percent of wasted energy when applied to UHPRO systems, reducing energy use and operating costs. 
As in seawater desalination, thermal technologies have been the technology of choice for ZLD and MLD systems in the industrial wastewater space. Similar to desalination, thermal technologies are also an energy intensive and cost-intensive method for cleaning water; in traditional ZLD and MLD configurations, up to fifty percent of costs typically come from cost and energy-intensive thermal treatments. A growing trend in these markets is to add a RO section in the filter process, which further increases overall water recovery before sending the resulting brine to the final stage consisting of an energy-intensive evaporation process. UHPRO can be applied to ZLD and MLD systems to reduce the size of the thermal portion of the treatment process while achieving the same water treatment objectives. While adoption of UHPRO in industrial wastewater treatment is in its early stage, we believe our Ultra PX can help make UHPRO the preferred treatment option to achieve ZLD and MLD requirements by enhancing UHPRO’s affordability and efficiency compared to thermal treatment options, similar to the impact of our PX in the seawater desalination market. 
We signed our first commercial purchase order for the Ultra PX in 2020 to support the industrial wastewater treatment operations of a chemical manufacturer in central India. These Ultra PXs were shipped in late 2020. We expect this project to be commissioned by the second quarter of 2021.

Manufacturing
Our products, including our PX, Turbochargers, high-pressure pumps, and circulation “booster” pumps, are designed, produced, assembled and tested in our facilities located in California and Texas. Our California facilities include advanced ceramics manufacturing and testing laboratories, multiple hydraulic performance testing loops, computer numerical control (“CNC”) machines, assembly stations and warehouse. 
Alumina ceramic components for our PX are manufactured in-house from high-grade alumina to the final product. Components for our other products also undergo final precision finishing to protect the proprietary nature of our manufacturing methods and product designs and to maintain premium quality standards. The availability of multiple test loops allows us to test every water product we manufacture to its full operating conditions.
We obtain raw, processed and certain pre-machined materials from various suppliers to support our manufacturing operations. A limited number of these suppliers are near sole source to maintain material consistency and support new product development. A qualified redundant material source exists in most cases, or whenever feasible.
Through our vertically integrated ceramics precision manufacturing process, we ensure that all components meet our high standards for quality, durability, and reliability.
Our Texas facility is focused on the manufacturing and testing of tungsten carbide. We source our tungsten carbide cartridges from global manufacturers and finalize machining, assembly and testing at Texas facility. This facility can also be used to augment alumina ceramics manufacturing as, and if, needed.
Our production facilities operate under the principles of Lean Manufacturing, and we continuously seek ways to improve product and process performance. Our quality management system is certified to ISO9001:2015 standards, and we are in the process of qualifying our safety management system to the ISO45001 standard. In addition, we are pursuing the path to ISO14001 certification for our environmental management system. 
Research, Development and Technology
Our unique pressure exchanger technology provides benefits when applied to industrial fluid-flow systems with pressure differentials and functions as a technology platform upon which different product applications can be built. R&D of our pressure exchanger technology is a key driver of our future evolution. When developing products, we seek three distinct process criteria: (1) high rates of liquid or gas flow; (2) large pressure differentials; and (3) high degrees of capital and energy intensity, specifically in the form of pumping and/or compression assets. Using these criteria, our product development strategy is to identify liquid and gas applications where equipment is being destroyed or adversely affected and/or where pressure energy is being wasted. We maintain a product development road map, which guides R&D resource allocation across all business units. Our R&D team guides products through defined development stages with structured toll-gate reviews throughout the process.
We have invested in R&D to support our product development strategy and have significantly grown our R&D organization. We maintain advanced testing capabilities to test our PX, Turbocharger, and pump solutions at our various company sites.
Our engineers specialize in a range of technical fields critical to supporting our current product lines and advancing our incubation initiatives, including core engineering competencies of fluid mechanics and aerodynamics, solid mechanics with expertise in computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis, bearings design (roller-element, hydrostatic, and hydrodynamic), multi-phase flow, dynamics and controls, acoustics and vibrations, tribology, material science and coatings, pumps and turbines, turbo-machinery, and rotating equipment.
We have invested in advanced numerical modeling and analytical tools that allow for 3-dimensional (“3D”), multi-phase, multi-physics, and multi-scale, computational fluid dynamics and fluid structure interactions. Leading-edge modeling and analytical techniques coupled with extensive experimental capabilities allow us to further refine our existing water and oil & gas technologies, as well as developing new derivatives of our pressure exchanger technology for complex systems and applications.

Our R&D investments are focused on: (1) advances to our existing pressure exchanger solutions to better service our water end markets; (2) applications of pressure exchanger technology within and outside of the water markets; and (3) fundamental research into new applications of our pressure exchanger technology in existing and new verticals, including gas processing applications. All projects are managed through a disciplined new product development process and project managed to ensure we remain within scope, budget, and commercial timing as we proceed.
Information Technology
We rely on our information technology (“IT”) and data systems in connection with many of our business activities. As the role of technology in our business expands, so too does the importance of cybersecurity. We take protecting our brand, systems, data, intellectual property, and customer and employee information, seriously. We actively monitor and manage our IT for security risks (e.g., cybersecurity risks), and look to mitigate these risks through enterprise-wide programs, annual employee training and vulnerability assessments. We have made, and continue to make, investments in a skilled IT workforce and leadership, and critical technologies.
Our enterprise-wide programs include endpoint security and encryption, network intrusion prevention and detection, a system for managing and installing patches for third-party applications, and security information and event management (“SIEM”) systems that monitor our infrastructure and alert our security operations center of potential cybersecurity issues. We strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at our facilities. Local network access is restricted by domain authentication, using stringent access control lists and virtual local area networks (“VLAN”). Multi-factor authentication is used to build an additional layer of security for remote-work access to critical applications. Our information security department regularly performs penetration testing and we engage a third-party penetration testing company to conduct penetration tests to identify and remediate any issues.
Under our enterprise-wide approach to risk management, cybersecurity is “high-level” risk that is reported to, and overseen by, our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists of three non-employee independent directors, of which one of these directors has information systems experience. In addition to the enterprise-wide initiatives, we purchase cybersecurity insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cybersecurity-related incidents. We continually strengthen and enhance our programs and controls around people, process and technology, and apply risk-based strategies to enhance prevention, detection, and response efforts.
Intellectual Property
We seek patent protection for new technologies, inventions, and improvements that are likely to be incorporated into our solutions. We rely on patents, trade secret laws, and contractual safeguards to protect the proprietary tooling, processing techniques, and other know-how used in the production of our solutions. We have a robust intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio consisting of U.S. and international issued patents as well as pending patent applications.
We have registered the following trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark office: “ERI,” “PX,” “PX Pressure Exchanger,” “Pressure Exchanger,” “Ultra PX,” “PX PowerTrain,” the Energy Recovery logo, “Making Desalination Affordable,” and “IsoBoost.” Applications are pending for “VorTeq.” We have also applied for and received registrations in international trademark offices.
Human Capital Resources
Our employees are the key to our success; our unparalleled PX ingenuity, our sales growth, and our ability to meet production growth. This is all enabled by our employees who challenge the status quo, actively partner to resolve challenges, and continuously improve. As of December 31, 2020, we had 216 employees. We also engage a relatively small number of independent contractors, primarily as sales and service agents worldwide. We experienced limited manufacturing disruptions at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but have otherwise been largely unaffected. Our employees are not unionized. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Our Code of Business Conduct ensures that our core values of integrity, ingenuity, teamwork, safety and continuous improvement are applied throughout our operations. Our Code of Business Conduct serves as a critical tool to help all of us recognize and report unethical conduct, while preserving and nurturing our culture.

We are committed to maintaining a diverse workforce and working toward a more inclusive work environment. Employees are treated with dignity and respect in an environment free from harassment and discrimination. We know that diversity is truly a competitive advantage that helps drive innovation, and we strive to continuously improve a best-in-class work environment that respects individual’s ideas and contributions. We benefit from the innovation that results when people with differing experiences, perspectives and cultures work together. Our Code of Business Conduct is reflected in our employee manual and training programs, including our policies against harassment and bullying, and the elimination of bias in the workplace, which we provide to all of our employees.
Our ability to create an engaged employee experience, throughout the process of attracting, onboarding, developing, and retaining employees, is our focus. We are committed to supporting employees’ development as well as providing competitive benefits and a safe workplace. 
Our employee engagement efforts include newsletters and all-employee town hall meetings, through which we aim to keep our employees well-informed and to increase transparency and open communication. In addition, we provide periodic employee training and development through which we strive to educate and enhance our employee’s financial, mental, and physical wellness. In addition to managing the pandemic and all the ways it has impacted our employees’ lives, we took the virtual meeting opportunity to connect and engage our company leaders and technical project influencers, from across the globe, by facilitating numerous leadership development sessions. These sessions empower our company leaders to improve their communication and recognize diversity of thought as a true benefit to teamwork.
Our compensation and benefit programs are designed to recognize our employees’ contributions to value ingenuity and business results, including variable pay, which rewards each employee for company and individual performance. In addition, employees are included in share-based equity award grants, health and welfare benefits, time-off, development programs and training, and opportunities to give back to our communities through donations of time and money. 
Employee safety remains our top priority, and to accomplish this goal, we developed, administered, and maintain company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each employee, as well as compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards. During fiscal year 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees, and subcontractors and customers who work at, or visit, our facilities. These protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities. We have also implemented weekly COVID-19 testing which provide an added layer of trust and comfort for our employees.
