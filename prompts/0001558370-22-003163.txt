ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
The Company
Ares Industrial Real Estate Income Trust Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed on August 12, 2014. As used herein, the terms “Ares Industrial Real Estate Income Trust,” “AIREIT,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Ares Industrial Real Estate Income Trust Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where otherwise indicated.
We were formed to make equity and debt investments in income-producing real estate assets consisting primarily of high-quality distribution warehouses and other industrial properties that are leased to creditworthy corporate customers throughout the U.S. Although we will continue to focus our investment activities primarily on distribution warehouses and other industrial properties, our charter and bylaws do not preclude us from investing in other types of commercial property, real estate debt, or real estate related equity securities.
We have operated and elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017, and we intend to continue to operate in accordance with the requirements for qualification as a REIT. We utilize an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (“UPREIT”) organizational structure to hold all or substantially all of our assets through our operating partnership, AIREIT Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and a limited partner.
We intend to conduct a continuous offering that will not have a predetermined duration, subject to continued compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable state laws. In order to execute this strategy in compliance with federal securities laws, we intend to file new registration statements to replace existing registration statements, such that there will not be any lag from one offering to the next. On August 4, 2021, the SEC declared our registration statement on Form S-11 with respect to our third public offering of up to $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock effective, and the third public offering commenced the same day. Our second public offering of up to $2.0 billion of shares of common stock was terminated immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration statement for the third public offering. Under the third public offering, we are offering up to $3.75 billion of shares of our common stock in the primary offering and up to $1.25 billion of shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, in any combination of Class T shares, Class D shares and Class I shares. We may reallocate amounts between the primary offering and distribution reinvestment plan.
Pursuant to our public offering, we offered and continue to offer shares of our common stock at the “transaction price,” plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The “transaction price” generally is equal to the net asset value (“NAV”) per share of our common stock most recently disclosed. Our NAV per share is calculated as of the last calendar day of each month for each of our outstanding classes of common stock, and is available generally within 15 calendar days after the end of the applicable month. Shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan are offered at the transaction price, as indicated above, in effect on the distribution date. We may update a previously disclosed transaction price in cases where we believe there has been a material change (positive or negative) to our NAV per share relative to the most recently disclosed monthly NAV per share. See Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Estimated Net Asset Value Per Share” for further detail.
Additionally, we have a program to raise capital through private placement offerings by selling beneficial interests in specific Delaware statutory trusts holding real properties (the “DST Program”). These private placement offerings are exempt from registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. We anticipate that these interests may serve as replacement properties for investors seeking to complete like-kind exchange transactions under Section 1031 of the Code. We expect that the DST Program will give us the opportunity to expand and diversify our capital raise strategies by offering what we believe to be an attractive and unique investment product for investors that may be seeking replacement properties to complete like-kind exchange transactions. We also make loans (“DST Program Loans”) to finance no more than 50% of the purchase price of the DST Interests to certain purchasers of the interests in the Delaware statutory trusts payable upon their acquisition of such interests. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold $492.2 million of gross interests related to the DST Program, $68.8 million of which were financed by DST Program Loans. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had raised gross proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion from the sale of 259.8 million shares of our common stock, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for information concerning our public offerings.

As of December 31, 2021, we directly owned and managed a real estate portfolio that included 193 industrial buildings totaling 37.6 million square feet located in 28 markets throughout the U.S., with 348 customers, and was 96.6% occupied (97.6% leased) with a weighted-average remaining lease term (based on square feet) of approximately 4.4 years. The occupied rate reflects the square footage with a paying customer in place. The leased rate includes the occupied square footage and additional square footage with leases in place that have not yet commenced. As of December 31, 2021, our real estate portfolio included:

● | 183 industrial buildings totaling approximately 36.1 million square feet comprised our operating portfolio, which includes stabilized properties, and was 98.3% occupied (98.3% leased) with a weighted-average remaining lease term (based on square feet) of approximately 4.4 years; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 10 industrial buildings totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet comprised our value-add portfolio, which includes buildings acquired with the intention to reposition or redevelop, or buildings recently completed which have not yet reached stabilization. We generally consider a building to be stabilized on the earlier to occur of the first anniversary of a building’s shell completion or a building achieving 90% occupancy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On July 15, 2020, we acquired minority ownership interests in two joint venture partnerships, which include Build-to-Core Industrial Partnership I LP (the “BTC I Partnership”) and Build-To-Core Industrial Partnership II LP (the “BTC II Partnership” and, together with the BTC I Partnership, the “BTC Partnership”), with third party investors, for $301.0 million in cash paid at closing, exclusive of due diligence expenses and other closing costs. As of the date of acquisition, the joint venture partnerships’ aggregate real estate portfolios consisted of 64 acquired or completed buildings and 18 buildings under construction or in the pre-construction phase.
On June 15, 2021, we, along with our joint venture partners, entered into a transaction (the “BTC I Partnership Transaction”) to split the portfolio of the BTC I Partnership (the “BTC I Portfolio”), which, prior to the transaction, consisted of 44 buildings totaling approximately 12.1 million square feet. As a result of the BTC I Partnership Transaction (described further in “Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements”), we own a 100% interest in 22 buildings that were previously part of the BTC I Portfolio, totaling approximately 5.4 million square feet with a total cost of $876.7 million, which includes the cost of our minority joint venture interest in the BTC I Partnership and our incremental additional investment of approximately $580 million, exclusive of transaction costs, to effect the split of the BTC I Portfolio. 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned and managed 29 buildings totaling approximately 6.9 million square feet and six buildings either under construction or in the pre-construction phase totaling approximately 1.8 million square feet (the “BTC II Portfolio”), through our 12.0% minority ownership interest in the BTC II Partnership (as described in “Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements”). Unless otherwise noted, these buildings are excluded from the presentation of our portfolio data herein. See “Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for information regarding transactions effected subsequent to December 31, 2021 with respect to the BTC II Partnership.
See Item 2, “Properties,” for further details on our real estate portfolio. See “Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for detail regarding our acquisition activity for the year ended December 31, 2021.
We rely on the Advisor, a related party, to manage our day-to-day operating and acquisition activities and to implement our investment strategy pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement (2022), dated February 11, 2022 (the “Advisory Agreement”), by and among us, the Operating Partnership, and the Advisor. The current term of the Advisory Agreement ends May 1, 2022, subject to renewal by our board of directors for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods. The Advisor performs its duties and responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement as a fiduciary of us and our stockholders. The Advisor may, but is not required to, establish working capital reserves from proceeds from our public offerings, from cash flow generated by operating assets or from proceeds from the sale of assets. Working capital reserves are typically utilized to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and major capital expenditures. Our lenders also may require working capital reserves.
Investment Objectives
Our primary investment objectives include the following:

● | preserving and protecting our stockholders’ capital contributions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

● | providing current income to our stockholders in the form of regular distributions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | realizing capital appreciation in our NAV from active investment management and asset management.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no assurance that we will attain our investment objectives. Our charter places numerous limitations on us with respect to the manner in which we may invest our funds. In most cases these limitations cannot be changed unless our charter is amended, which may require the approval of our stockholders.
Investment Strategy
We have and will continue to focus our investment activities on and use the proceeds raised in the offerings principally for building a national industrial warehouse operating company. Our investment activities include the acquisition, development and/or financing of income-producing real estate assets consisting primarily of high-quality distribution warehouses and other industrial properties that are leased to creditworthy corporate customers. Creditworthiness does not necessarily mean investment grade and the majority of our customers do not have a public credit rating. Furthermore, it is anticipated that much of our portfolio will be leased to non-investment grade customers going forward. We evaluate creditworthiness and financial strength of prospective customers based on financial, operating and business plan information that is provided to us by such prospective customers, as well as other market and economic information that is generally publicly available.
The number and type of properties we may acquire or develop will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time we make our investments. Although we intend to continue to focus our investment activities primarily on distribution warehouses and other industrial properties, our charter and bylaws do not preclude us from investing in other types of commercial property or real estate-related debt. However, we will not invest more than 25% of net proceeds we receive from the sale of shares of our common stock in the offerings in other types of commercial property or real estate-related debt. As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio was comprised entirely of industrial properties. See Item 2, “Properties,” for further detail.
Our investment in any distribution warehouse, other industrial property, or other property type will be based upon the best interests of our company and our stockholders as determined by the Advisor and our board of directors. Real estate assets in which we may invest may be acquired or developed either directly by us or through joint venture partnerships or other co-ownership arrangements with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties, and may include: equity investments in commercial properties; mortgage, mezzanine, construction, bridge, and other loans related to real estate; and investments in other real estate-related entities, including REITs, private real estate funds, real estate management companies, real estate development companies, and debt funds, both foreign and domestic. Subject to the 25% limitation described above, we may invest in any of these asset classes, including those that may present greater risk than industrial properties. The BTC II Partnership invests in an industrial real estate portfolio comprised of approximately (i) 30.0% development investments, and (ii) 70.0% core and value-add investments (based on purchase price), as of December 31, 2021.
Business Strategy
We seek to provide income in the form of regular distributions to our stockholders by generating sustained internal growth in rental income. The keys to long-term rental income growth are maintaining a stabilized occupancy rate (generally above 90%) through active leasing efforts, negotiating contractual rent increases on existing leases and renewals on expiring leases, cultivating strong customer relationships, and controlling operating expenses. 
Financing Objectives
We use secured and unsecured debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of assets, to pay distributions, and for other corporate purposes. While a large percentage of our debt financings may typically be comprised of long-term, fixed-rate loans, our use of leverage generally increases the risk of default on loan payments and the resulting foreclosure on a particular asset or group of assets. Upon a default, our lenders may also have recourse to assets other than those specifically securing the repayment of the indebtedness. Our ability to enhance our investment returns and to increase our diversification by acquiring assets using additional funds provided through borrowings could be adversely impacted if the credit markets are closed or limited and banks and other lending institutions impose severe restrictions on the amount of funds available for the types of loans we seek. We have sourced, and may continue to source, institutional or other capital through joint venture partnerships or other co-partnerships to help diversify risk associated with development and value-add opportunities. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Debt Financing” for further detail.

Competition
The market for the acquisition of industrial real estate is highly competitive. We compete for real property investments with other REITs and institutional investors, such as pension funds and their advisors, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts, private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including certain other entities sponsored or advised by affiliates of the Sponsor, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk, including risks relating to the creditworthiness of potential customers, the breadth of the markets in which to invest, or the level of leverage they are willing to take on. They also may possess significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital or greater operating efficiencies associated with a larger platform.
The market for the leasing of industrial real estate is also very competitive. We experience competition for customers from other existing assets in proximity to our buildings, as well as from proposed new developments. As a result, we may have to provide free rental periods, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
Significant Customers
We are dependent upon the ability of current customers to pay their contractual rent amounts as the rents become due. As of December 31, 2021, there was one customer that individually represented more than 5.0% of total annualized base rent, and our 10 largest customers represented approximately 25.2% of total annualized base rent of our portfolio. We are not aware of any current customers whose inability alone to pay their contractual rental amounts would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. See Item 2, “Properties,” for further detail about customer diversification.
Conflicts of Interest
We are subject to various potential conflicts of interest that could arise out of our relationship with the Advisor and other affiliates and related parties, including: conflicts related to the compensation arrangements among the Advisor, certain affiliates and related parties, and us; conflicts with respect to the allocation of the Advisor’s and its key personnel’s time; conflicts related to our potential acquisition of assets from affiliates of the Advisor; and conflicts with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities. Further, entities currently sponsored by or that in the future may be advised by affiliates of the Sponsor, and those in which Sponsor-affiliated entities own interests, may compete with us or may be given priority over us with respect to the acquisition of certain types of investments. As a result of our potential competition with these entities, certain investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to us may not in fact be available. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Advisor and Its Affiliates,” for additional detail. The independent directors have an obligation to function on our behalf in all situations in which a conflict of interest may arise and have a fiduciary obligation to act on behalf of our stockholders.
Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Laws
Properties that we acquire, and the properties underlying our investments, are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations. Under these laws, ordinances, and regulations, a current or previous owner of real estate (including, in certain circumstances, a secured lender that succeeds to ownership or control of a property) may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at, on, under, or in its property. These laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or control party knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation, remediation, or removal of these substances may be substantial and could exceed the value of the property. An owner or control party of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to materials containing asbestos. These laws allow third parties to seek recovery from owners of properties for personal injuries associated with materials containing asbestos. Our operating costs and the values of these assets may be adversely affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations, as well as the cost of complying with future legislation, and our income and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be affected adversely by the existence of an environmental liability with respect to our properties. We will endeavor to ensure our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances, and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products.
