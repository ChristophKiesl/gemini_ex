ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
The following discussion of our business contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in Part II, Item 7 below. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks as set forth in Part I, Item 1A below. The following information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and the Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Overview
Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations (collectively, “Terminix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is a leading provider of residential and commercial termite and pest management services, specializing in protection against termite damage, rodents, insects and other pests, including cockroaches, spiders, wood-destroying ants, ticks, fleas, mosquitos and bed bugs. Our services include termite remediation, annual termite inspection and prevention treatments that may include termite damage repair guarantees, periodic pest management services, insulation services, crawlspace encapsulation, wildlife exclusion and disinfection services. Our portfolio of well-recognized brands includes Terminix, Assured Environments, Copesan Services, Inc. (“Copesan”), Gregory Pest Solutions (“Gregory”), McCloud Services (“McCloud”) and Nomor AB (“Nomor”). We have one reportable segment, our pest management and termite business. Our vision is to be the global leader in professional pest management by consistently delivering superior solutions that build unrivaled trust and value with our stakeholders. 
Organized in Delaware in 2007, Terminix is the successor to various entities dating back to 1927. Terminix operates through an extensive service network of approximately 380 company-owned branches in the United States (“U.S.”), Europe, Canada, Mexico and Central America, over 100 franchise and licensed locations in the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, and joint ventures in India and China. Terminix serves both residential and commercial customers, principally in the U.S. We made a daily average of over 50,000 visits to residential and commercial customer locations during 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Terminix recorded revenue of $2,045 million, net income of $125 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $387 million. For a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In 2021, approximately 93 percent of our revenue was generated by sales in the U.S. and approximately 90 percent of the book value of our assets is located in the U.S. 
Revenue from services in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:


 | 2021 | | 2020
Residential Pest Management | 36 | % | | 36 | %
Commercial Pest Management | 27 | % | | 27 | %
Termite and Home Services | 32 | % | | 32 | %
Sales of Products and Other | 5 | % | | 5 | %

Over 80 percent of Terminix revenue comes from customers who enter into contracts with the option to renew periodically (e.g. annually, monthly or quarterly). Typically, termite services require an initial inspection and the installation of a protective bait station or, in certain situations, a liquid barrier surrounding the home. Termite contracts can be either service contracts or protection plans. The protection plan contracts provide a guarantee for the repair of new damage resulting from termite infestation. After the initial term, typically one year, a customer has the option to renew the contract at a significantly reduced cost that extends the guarantee. Consequently, revenue generated from a renewal customer is less than revenue generated from a first-year termite customer. “Sales of Products and Other” includes product sales and franchise fees. Franchise fees represent less than one percent of our revenue.

Sale of ServiceMaster Brands
On October 1, 2020, we completed the sale of the assets and liabilities of the ServiceMaster Brands businesses, which was comprised of the Amerispec, Furniture Medic, Merry Maids, ServiceMaster Clean and ServiceMaster Restore brands, certain assets and liabilities of ServiceMaster Acceptance Corporation, our financing subsidiary that was historically reported as part of European Pest Control and Other, and the ServiceMaster trade name (the “ServiceMaster Brands Divestiture Group”) for $1,541 million to RW Purchaser LLC, an affiliate of investment funds managed by Roark Capital Management LLC (“Roark”) after working capital adjustments, resulting in a gain of $494 million, net of income taxes. We also entered into a transition services agreement and sublease agreement with Roark. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these agreements. 
The historical results of the ServiceMaster Brands Divestiture Group, including the results of operations, cash flows and related assets and liabilities, are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein.
COVID-19
Since March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic (“COVID-19” or “pandemic”), we have experienced increased demand in our residential pest management and termite and home services service lines as customers are spending more time at home. We have also experienced disruptions in our business, primarily in the commercial pest management service line, driven by both temporary and permanent business closures and service postponements, and in our product sales and other service line. We continue to focus on initiatives to ensure the safety and productivity of our teammates, including providing personal protective equipment and designing safety policies and measures for our field teammates, and relying on technology to facilitate remote working, with most back-office and all call center teammates working remotely and field support teammates working remotely where possible. 
Proposed Acquisition by Rentokil 
On December 13, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Rentokil Initial plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (“Rentokil”), Rentokil Initial US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Rentokil (“Bidco”), Leto Holdings I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco (“Merger Sub I”), and Leto Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco (“Merger Sub II”), pursuant to which, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, (1) Merger Sub I will merge with and into the Company (the “First Merger”), with the Company surviving the First Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco, and (2) immediately following the effective time of the First Merger (the “Effective Time”), the Company, as the surviving corporation in the First Merger, will merge with and into Merger Sub II (the “Second Merger” and, together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”), with Merger Sub II surviving the Second Merger as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Bidco and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Rentokil.

Under the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive either:

a number of American depositary shares of Rentokil (each representing a beneficial interest in five ordinary shares of Rentokil) equal to (A) 1.0619 (the “Exchange Ratio”) plus (B) the quotient of $11.00 (the “Per Share Cash Amount”) and the volume weighted average price (measured in U.S. dollars) of Rentokil American depositary shares (measured using the volume weighted average price of Rentokil ordinary shares as a proxy) for the trading day that is two trading days prior to the Effective Time (or such other date as may be mutually agreed to by Rentokil and the Company) (such price, the “Rentokil ADS Price,” and such number of Rentokil American depositary shares, the “Stock Consideration”); or

an amount in cash, without interest, and in USD equal to the sum of (A) the Per Share Cash Amount plus (B) the product of the Exchange Ratio and the Rentokil ADS Price (the “Cash Consideration,” and together with the “Stock Consideration,” the “Merger Consideration”),

in each case at the election of the holder of such share of our common stock, subject to certain allocation and proration provisions of the Merger Agreement. Immediately following such conversion, our shares of common stock will be automatically cancelled and cease to exist. The aggregate Cash Consideration and the aggregate Stock Consideration that will be issued in the Mergers will not vary as a result of individual election preferences.

The respective obligations of the Company and Rentokil to consummate the Mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders, approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and other related matters by Rentokil’s shareholders, and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

 

Our Opportunity 
We believe our business is strategically positioned to benefit from a number of favorable demographic and secular trends, including growth in population, household formation, new and existing home sales increasing regulation of commercial pest management services and increasing pest populations driven by the increasing temperatures of climate change. In addition, we believe there is increasing demand for outsourced services, fueled by a trend toward “do-it-for-me” as a result of an aging population and shifts in household structure and behaviors, such as dual-income families and consumers with “on-the-go” lifestyles. 
U.S. Termite and Pest Management Industry
The outsourced segment for residential and commercial termite and pest management services in the U.S. was approximately $10 billion in 2021. We estimate that there are approximately 19,000 U.S. termite and pest management companies, nearly all of which have fewer than 100 teammates.
Termites are responsible for an estimated $5 billion in home damage in the U.S. annually. The termite control industry provides treatment and inspection services to residential and commercial property owners for the remediation and prevention of termite infestations. We believe homeowners value quality and reliability over price in choosing professional termite control services, as the cost of most professional treatments is well below the potential cost of inaction or ineffective treatment. As a result, we believe the demand for termite remediation services is relatively insulated from changes in consumer spending. In addition to remediation services, the termite control industry offers periodic termite inspections and preventative treatments to residential and commercial property owners in areas with high termite activity, typically through renewable contracts. These contracts may carry guarantees that protect the property owner against the cost of structural damage caused by a termite infestation. Termites can cause significant damage to a structure before becoming visible to the untrained eye, highlighting the value proposition of professional preventative termite services. As a result, the termite control industry experiences high renewal rates on these preventative inspection and treatment contracts and revenues from such contracts are generally stable and recurring.
Pest infestations may damage a home or business while also carrying the risk of the spread of diseases. Moreover, for many commercial facilities, pest management is essential to regular operations and regulatory compliance (e.g., food processing, hotels, restaurants and healthcare facilities). As a result of these dynamics, the pest management industry experiences high rates of renewal for its pest inspection and treatment contracts. Pest management services are often delivered on a contracted basis through regularly scheduled service visits, which include an inspection of premises and application of pest management materials. 
Both termite and pest activity are affected by weather. Termite activity increases during the spring and summer months, the intensity of which varies based on weather and is changing due to the effects of climate change. Similarly, pest activity tends to accelerate in the spring months when warmer temperatures arrive in many U.S. regions. However, the high proportion of termite and pest management services which are contracted and recurring, as well as the high renewal rates for those services, limit the effect of weather anomalies on the termite and pest management industry in any given year.
European Pest Management Industry
The European pest management market was approximately $4.9 billion in 2021. Our European operations currently represent four percent of our revenue. 
Our Competitive Strengths
#1 Recognized brand in U.S. termite and pest management services. We are a leading provider of essential residential and commercial services. The pest management industry is large, growing and highly fragmented, and we believe we have significant advantages over smaller local and regional competitors. We have spent decades developing a reputation built on reliability and superior quality and service. As a result, we enjoy industry leading brand awareness and a reputation for high-quality customer service, both of which serve as key drivers of our customer acquisition efforts. Our nationwide presence also allows our brands to effectively serve both local residential customers and large national commercial accounts.
Passionate and empowered teammates focused on delivering superior customer service. We believe our high customer retention demonstrates the valued nature of the services we offer and the consistently strong level of customer service that we provide. Many of our technicians have built long-standing, personal relationships with their customers. We believe these personal bonds, often forged over decades, help to drive customer loyalty and retention. As a result of our high retention and long-standing customer relationships, we enjoy significant visibility and stability in our business, and these factors limit the effect of adverse economic cycles on our revenue base. 
We are constantly focused on improving customer service. The customer experience is at the foundation of our business model and we believe that each teammate is an extension of Terminix’s reputation. We employ rigorous hiring and training practices and continuously analyze our operating metrics to identify potential improvements in service and productivity. Technicians in our Terminix branches create continuity in customer relationships and ensure the development of best practices based on on-the-ground experience. We also provide our field teammates with access to sophisticated data management and mobility tools which enable them to drive efficiencies, improve customer service and ultimately grow our customer base and profitability.

 

Trusted pest management expertise built over a 95-year history. We believe our long history, rigorous training practices and high level of customer service establishes our reputation as the trusted expert in the eyes of our residential and commercial customers. The relationship of our technician with our customers is the foundation of our business and we believe sharing our expertise with customers to mitigate and prevent pest infestation is an important component of our service offering. Supported by mobile technology and robust inspection techniques, our technicians are able to provide valuable insights to customers that allow them to protect their most important asset. We believe the development of this relationship across our customer base with an average of over 50,000 touchpoints per day enhances our ability to cross-sell and increase customer penetration. 
Expansive scale and deep presence across a national footprint. We are diversified in terms of customers and geographies within the U.S. We serve approximately 2.9 million residential and commercial customers across the U.S. Our diverse customer base and geographies help to mitigate the effect of adverse regional weather and market conditions and other risks in any particular geography or customer segment we serve. We therefore believe our size and scale provides us with added protection from risk relative to our smaller local and regional competitors.
Effective multi-channel customer acquisition strategy. Our multi-channel marketing approach focuses on building the value of our brands and generating revenue by understanding the decisions consumers make at each stage in the purchase of residential and commercial services. We also have been deploying increasingly sophisticated consumer analytics models that allow us to more effectively segment our prospective customers and tailor campaigns towards them. In addition, we are seeing success with innovative ways of reaching and marketing to consumers, including e-commerce, digital content marketing, online reputation management and social media channels.
History of innovative leadership and introducing new products and services.
Solid revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth through business cycles. Our consolidated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA compound annual growth rates from 2017 through 2021 were seven percent and nine percent, respectively. We believe that our strong performance is attributable to the essential nature of our services, our strong value proposition and management’s focus on driving results through strategic investment and operational execution.
Solid margins with attractive operating leverage and productivity improvement initiatives. Our business model enjoys inherent operating leverage stemming from route density and fixed investments in infrastructure and technology, among other factors. This allows us to generate productivity to expand margins through a variety of initiatives, including metric-driven continuous improvement in our customer care centers, application of consistent process guidelines at the branch level, leveraging size and scale to improve the sourcing of labor and materials and deploying shared services models. We have also deployed mobility solutions and routing and scheduling systems across our business in order to enhance overall efficiency and reduce operating costs.
Our Strategy 
Grow Our Customer Base. We are focused on the growth of our business through the introduction and delivery of high-value services to new and existing customers. 
To accelerate new customer growth, we make strategic investments in sales, marketing and advertising to drive new business leads, brand awareness and market share. In addition, we employ multiple initiatives to improve customer satisfaction and service delivery, which we believe leads to improved retention and growth in our customer base across our service lines.
Develop and Expand New Service Offerings. We intend to continue to leverage our existing sales channels and local coverage to deliver additional value-added services to our customers. Our product development teams draw upon the experience of our technicians in the field, combined with in-house scientific expertise, to create innovative customer solutions for both our existing customer base and identified service/category adjacencies. We have a strong history of new product introductions, such as Terminix’s crawlspace encapsulation, disinfection services, mosquito control and wildlife exclusion services, that we believe will appeal to new potential customers as well as our existing customer base. Mosquito, wildlife exclusion and crawl space encapsulation are being offered in substantially all U.S. geographic segments where we believe significant opportunity exists. We are now focusing our efforts on increasing our market share in these product lines.
National Accounts Platform. Our Terminix and Copesan brands provide national account service offerings in commercial pest management and provide us with the opportunity to expand into combined offerings in the future. These national account customers operate multi-location businesses that leverage our national footprint.
Grow Our Commercial Business. Our revenue from commercial customers comprised approximately 27 percent of our 2021 revenue. We believe we are well positioned to leverage our national coverage, brand strength and broad service offerings to target both large multi-regional accounts and local and regional commercial customers. Our commercial expansion strategy targets industries with a demonstrated need for our services, including healthcare, manufacturing, warehouses, hotels and commercial real estate.
Expand the Geographies We Serve. Through detailed assessments of local economic conditions and demographics, we have identified target geographies for expansion, both in existing geographies where we have capacity to increase our local position and in new geographies, where we see opportunities. 

 

Enhance Our Profitability. We have and will continue to invest in initiatives designed to improve our margins and drive profitable growth. We have been able to increase productivity through actions such as continuous process improvement, targeted systems investments, sales force initiatives and technician mobility tools. We also focus on strategically capitalizing on our purchasing power to achieve more favorable pricing and terms. In addition, we have implemented tools and processes to centralize and systematize pricing decisions. These tools and processes enable us to optimize pricing at the local and product levels while creating a flexible and scalable pricing architecture across our business. We intend to leverage these investments as well as identify further opportunities to enhance profitability.
Pursue Selective Acquisitions. Historically, we have a track record of being able to source and purchase targets at accretive prices and successfully integrate them into our business to increase branch density and improve operating margins. We anticipate that the highly fragmented nature of the markets in which we operate will continue to create opportunities for further consolidation. In the future, we intend to continue to take advantage of tuck-in as well as strategic acquisition opportunities, including Terminix franchise repurchases, particularly in under-penetrated geographies where we can enhance and expand our service capabilities. 
Capital-Light Business Model
Our business model is characterized by strong margins and limited capital requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations was $239 million, $198 million and $164 million, respectively, and our property additions were $22 million, $26 million and $25 million, respectively. Free Cash Flow was $217 million, $172 million and $139 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations, which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Sales and Marketing
We market our services to both homeowners and businesses through various means, including digital marketing, television and radio advertising, print advertisements, marketing partnerships, door-to-door summer sales programs, telemarketing, various social media channels and through national, regional and local sales teams. 
Customers and Geographies 
Our revenues are not dependent on a single customer. However, a significant percentage of our revenue is concentrated in the southern and western regions of the U.S., with California, Texas and Florida collectively accounting for approximately one-third of our revenue in 2021. 
Competition
We compete in the residential and commercial termite and pest management markets. We compete with many other companies in the sale of our services and products. The principal methods of competition in our business include quality and speed of service, brand awareness and reputation, technology and systems, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, professional sales forces, contractor network and referrals. All of the primary market segments in which we operate are highly fragmented, with approximately 19,000 providers nationwide. While competition includes many smaller independent competitors that make up the majority of the pest control market, our larger, more recognizable competitors include Orkin, Inc. (a subsidiary of Rollins, Inc.), Ecolab, Inc., Rentokil and Anticimex International AB, all of which compete internationally.
Information Technology
We have invested in information systems and software packages designed to allow us to grow efficiently and scale across our organization, while retaining local and regional flexibility. Our sophisticated IT systems enable us to provide a high level of convenience and service to our customers. We are developing a new customer experience platform to replace legacy operating systems as part of a fundamental reimagining of our operating model which will provide a full 360-degree vision of the customer and enable more data driven decision making. The new customer experience platform began a phased deployment at the end of 2021, and we believe it will provide us with a competitive advantage in our operations.
Human Capital Management
Terminix employs approximately 10,000 teammates in the U.S. and 1,700 teammates outside the U.S. in Europe, Canada and Central America. As a leader in the pest management industry, we recognize that our teammates are our most important asset in the delivery of the services we provide to customers. Since we deliver services in various communities around the world, it is important that our Teammate base reflect the values and customers of those communities we serve. In this regard, we are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and equitable workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent, enabling us to better serve to our customers. 
Five key areas in which we focus our efforts include:
1.Teammate Safety
2.Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity
3.Training and Development
4.Teammate Retention

 


5.Compensation and Benefits
Teammate Safety
At Terminix, safety is a core value. We maintain strong safety programs focused on continuously improving the safety and wellbeing of our communities, our teammates and the customers we serve. We maintain a safety first always culture grounded in striving for zero teammate injuries and illnesses, while operating and delivering our services responsibly and sustainably, and eliminating workplace safety incidents, risks and hazards. We review and monitor our performance regularly with a goal to continually reduce recordable incidents. During 2021, our recordable incident rate declined more than fifteen percent compared to 2020. 
Since March 2020 when COVID-19 initially impacted the U.S. and continuing throughout 2021, our focus on workplace safety enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keep our teammates, workplace visitors and customers safe. 
Terminix was designated an essential business early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our teammates manage their work and personal responsibilities, with the priority on teammate wellbeing, health and safety. Terminix has worked with suppliers to ensure we provide our teammates with the appropriate personal protection equipment to allow them to continue to serve our customers in a safe manner, protecting both the customer and the teammate. We continue to evaluate and evolve our COVID-19 protocols to align with the most current health recommendations in order to minimize any exposure to the virus by our teammates.
Inclusion, Diversity and Equity
At Terminix, we believe inclusion inspires results. Perspectives from a diverse workforce can provide key insights into selling into diverse communities, providing numerous avenues for the growth of the business and ultimately improving customer satisfaction. 
The Company has created a Culture, Inclusion and Diversity Advisory Team (“Advisory Team”) with a mission to foster actions that create an inclusive work environment valuing the contributions and perspectives of all teammates. The goal of the Advisory Team is to advance a workforce that builds and advocates for gender, race, age, language, cultural background, education, work experience, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical ability, as well as the religious and cultural views of our teammates. The Advisory Team is representative of Terminix teammates chosen to help engage in ongoing evaluation of Terminix’s internal business practices and advise the Terminix executive team on driving a culture of inclusion, diversity and equity.
The Advisory Team is committed to promoting and advancing this important work through five distinct subcommittees that drive inclusion, diversity and equity goals across core business streams:
Corporate Responsibility 
Culture
Inclusion
Supplier Diversity 
Talent and Equity 
As of December 31, 2021, our workforce in the U.S. consisted of 60 percent white and 40 percent minority representation. Also, our workforce was 81 percent male and 18 percent female, with one percent undeclared. Terminix is committed to improving the levels of both racial and gender representation to better reflect the communities in which we operate.
We have long-established, teammate-driven Business Resource Groups, which provide opportunities for education, community partnerships, cultural awareness and career development. 
Training and Development
We have made investments in our human resources organization and structure that centralized and standardized hiring and training practices. We have also introduced tools to help our branch managers manage labor more efficiently, and we continue to invest in attracting, developing and retaining talent. Our front-line teammates also receive on-the-job training to ensure we are executing for our customers. Our online training platforms provide our teammates with access to a multitude of training courses, videos, reference material and other tools. 
As part of encouraging internal development, we engage in regular discussions around succession planning and talent development at all levels of our Company. Our board of directors has frequent contact with business leaders within the organization and participates actively in the succession planning process. Our Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer reports directly to the CEO and works with management to evaluate internal talent for future leadership positions within the organization on an ongoing basis. In evaluating potential acquisitions, an important consideration is the quality of the management team of the target company and our ability to ensure such management team will remain with the Company as needed if we acquire the business.

Teammate Retention
Our experience has demonstrated that the retention of well-trained, high-performing teammates results in higher customer retention and improved financial results. Terminix has made significant investments in the hiring and training of teammates, especially those who are the Company’s face to the customer. Turnover rates for pest technicians tend to be higher in the first year of employment with a reduced rate beyond the first year. Consequently, Terminix has made investments in the recruiting, onboarding and training of new teammates to enhance their ability to deliver quality service to our customers and to keep them engaged in the Terminix business. The Company is also implementing the Terminix Way that includes the development of enhanced standard operating procedures, training paths and technology for frontline teammates that will improve consistency from branch-to-branch and teammate-to-teammate, and provide well-defined career paths for our teammates. 
Compensation and Benefits
Terminix is committed to investing in our workforce by providing competitive compensation and benefit programs. 
Compensation programs include base salary and variable compensation programs such as annual bonus, production plans, sales commissions, spot bonus and stock awards. The variable compensation programs are performance based, with the actual amount earned depending on the performance of the Company and the teammate. Other programs include:
Comprehensive health and dental coverage is offered to teammates; 
A 401(k) savings plan with a Company match is offered that allows teammates to save for their future;
Parental leave is provided to all new parents of both genders for births and adoptions; and 
Other insurance benefits are also offered, including Company-paid and supplemental teammate-paid life insurance, long-term disability and accidental death and disability coverage.
An Employee Stock Purchase Plan, where teammates can purchase stock in the Company to participate in the success of the Company, is also offered to teammates. This plan has been suspended as of December 31, 2021 due to the proposed acquisition by Rentokil.
Intellectual Property
We hold various service marks, trademarks and trade names, such as Terminix, that we deem particularly important to our advertising activities. As of December 31, 2021, we had marks that were protected by registration (either by direct registration or by treaty) in the U.S. and approximately 70 other countries. 
Insurance
We maintain insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for our business, including workers’ compensation, auto liability, general liability, umbrella and property insurance. In addition, we provide various insurance coverages, including deductible reimbursement policies, to our business units through our wholly-owned captive insurance company. 
Regulatory Compliance
Our business is subject to various international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, compliance with which increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services provided or the methods by which our business offers, sells and fulfills those services or conducts business, or subjects us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
These international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations include laws relating to consumer protection and data privacy, wage and hour, deceptive trade practices, permitting and licensing, state contractor laws, workers’ safety, tax, healthcare reforms, franchise-related issues, collective bargaining and other labor matters, environmental and teammate benefits. The Terminix business must also meet certain Occupational Health & Safety Administration (OSHA) requirements, as well as Department of Transportation and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration requirements with respect to certain vehicles in its fleet. Terminix is regulated by federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations which are enforced by pest management boards, environmental protection agencies and similar government entities. Terminix uses products containing ingredients regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”).
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our business is subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances and wastes and protect the health and safety of our teammates. These laws also impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances, including releases by prior owners or operators of sites we currently own or operate.
Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services provided or the methods by which we offer, sell and fulfill those services or conduct business, or subjects us to the possibility of regulatory or private actions or proceedings.

 

Terminix is regulated under many federal and state environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1947, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Clean Air Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Clean Water Act of 1977, each as amended.
We cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental laws on our operations. Changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, may lead to additional compliance or other costs. During 2021, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, and there are no material expenditures anticipated for 2022 or 2023 related to such facilities. 
Consumer Protection and Solicitation Matters
We are subject to international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations designed to protect consumers, including laws governing consumer privacy and fraud, the collection and use of consumer data, telemarketing and other forms of solicitation.
The telemarketing rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Telemarketing Sales Rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission govern our telephone sales practices. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates email solicitations and the Consumer Review Fairness Act regulates consumer opinions on social media regarding products and services. In addition, some states and local governing bodies have adopted laws and regulations targeted at direct telephone sales and “do-not-knock,” “do-not-mail” and “do-not-leave” activities. If we were to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities, suffer losses to our reputation and our business or suffer the loss of licenses or penalties that may affect how the business is operated, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
