Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (“Business Combination”). We were incorporated as CAPS Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company on August 11, 2015 and converted into a Delaware corporation on February 4, 2019. We consummated an initial public offering (“Public Offering”) on May 9, 2019, and are currently in the process of locating suitable targets for our Business Combination. We intend to use the cash proceeds from our Public Offering and Private Placement (as defined below) as well as additional issuances, if any, of our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt to complete the Business Combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
The Company’s management team is led by Tilman Fertitta, our Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Handler, our Co-Chairman and President. Mr. Fertitta is the sole shareholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fertitta Entertainment, Inc. (“FEI”) and Mr. Handler is the Chief Executive Officer of Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“JFG”), and its largest operating subsidiary, Jefferies Group LLC, a global investment banking firm. The Company’s sponsors are FEI and JFG (collectively, the “Sponsors”).
 
On May 9, 2019 we consummated a $316,250,000 Public Offering consisting of 31,625,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (“Unit”). Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value (the “Class A common stock”) and one-third of one redeemable warrant (each, a “Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Simultaneously, with the closing of the Public Offering, we consummated a $8,825,000 private placement (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 5,883,333 warrants (“Sponsor Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The Sponsor Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering except that, so long as they are held by our Sponsors or their permitted transferees, (i) they are not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our Sponsors until 30 days after the completion of our initial Business Combination and (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.
 
Prior to the Public Offering, in 2015, JFG purchased an aggregate of 1,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (100% of the issued and outstanding shares) for $1,000. On February 4, 2019, the Company amended the total number of authorized shares of all classes of capital stock to 221,000,000, of which 200,000,000 shares are Class A common stock; 20,000,000 shares are Class B shares at par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founders Shares”); and 1,000,000 shares are Preferred stock at par value $0.0001 per share. Simultaneously, the Company reclassified all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock to Founders Shares and conducted a 1:2,775 stock split. Also, on February 14, 2019, the Company issued 2,975,000 additional Founders Shares to FEI for $10,000. On March 13, 2019, the Company conducted a 1:1.25 stock split, and on May 6, 2019 the Company conducted a 1:1.10 stock split of the Founders Shares. Following these transactions, the Sponsors owned 7,906,250 issued and outstanding Founders Shares.

Upon the closing of the Public Offering and Private Placement, $316,250,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Public Offering and the Private Placement (including $11,068,750 of deferred underwriting commissions) was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). The Company’s third amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter”) provides that, other than the withdrawal of interest to pay tax obligations, none of the funds held in the Trust Account will be released until the earliest of: (i) the completion of the Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any shares of Class A common stock included in the Units being sold in the Public Offering (“Public Shares”) properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Charter to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the Business Combination by May 9, 2021 (within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering); or (iii) the redemption of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete the Business Combination by May 9, 2021, subject to applicable law. The proceeds held in the Trust Account can only be invested in permitted United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we had a balance in cash and investments held in trust of $319,901,512. As of December 31, 2019, no funds had been withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay taxes. In the first quarter of 2020, we paid our franchise tax liability of $177,431 from the trust earnings and expect to pay our current income tax liability of $664,486 also with trust earnings by the federal deadline of April 15, 2020.
 
The remaining $8,825,000 held outside of trust was used to pay underwriting commissions of $6,325,000, loans to our Sponsors, and deferred offering and formation costs. As of December 31, 2019, we had an unrestricted balance of $1,593,104 to satisfy our working capital purposes.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration. We may seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the Private Placement, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial Business Combination. In the case of an initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our Sponsors, officers, directors or stockholders are required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial Business Combination.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial Business Combination. The fair market value of our initial Business Combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as a discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial Business Combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial Business Combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial Business Combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test.
 
To the extent we effect our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.

In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsors, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founders Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules.
 
The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares by one of the two methods listed above is contained in provisions of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.

If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will:
 

· | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will:
 

· | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial Business Combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Submission of our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsors, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founders Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders’ Founders Shares, we would need only 11,859,376, or 37.5%, of the 31,625,000 Public Shares sold in the Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial Business Combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial Business Combination approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised). We intend to give not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial Business Combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an initial Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we will not restrict our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial Business Combination.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have until May 9, 2021 (24 months from the closing of the Public Offering) to complete our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination within such period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination within the 24-month time period.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination.

Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 1510 West Loop South, Houston, Texas 77027. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee that we pay FEI for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have five officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination.
Available Information
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov.
