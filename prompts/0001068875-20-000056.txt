ITEM 1. Business
General Overview
Blucora, Inc. (the “Company,” “Blucora,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leading provider of technology-enabled, tax-smart financial solutions to consumers, small business owners, tax professionals, financial advisors, and certified public accounting firms. Blucora helps people manage their financial lives and optimize their taxes through its two primary businesses: (1) the Wealth Management business and (2) the Tax Preparation business. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “BCOR.”
The Wealth Management business consists of the operations of Avantax Wealth Management (“Avantax,” the “Wealth Management business,” or the “Wealth Management segment”), which formerly operated under the HD Vest and 1st Global brands prior to the Rebranding (see “Item 1. Business—Our History” for more information about the Rebranding). Avantax provides tax-focused wealth management solutions for financial advisors, tax preparers, certified public accounting firms, and their clients and is the leading tax-focused independent broker-dealer. As of December 31, 2019, nearly 4,000 advisors with branch offices in all 50 states utilized our Avantax platform and supported $70.6 billion of total client assets, including $27.6 billion of advisory assets, for approximately 480,000 clients.
The Tax Preparation business consists of the operations of TaxAct, Inc. (“TaxAct,” the “Tax Preparation business,” or the “Tax Preparation segment”) and provides affordable digital do-it-yourself (“DDIY”) tax preparation solutions for consumers, small business owners and tax professionals through its website www.TaxAct.com. For the year ended December 31, 2019, TaxAct powered approximately 3.2 million consumer e-files directly through end-users and another 2.0 million professional e-files through approximately 21,000 tax professionals who used TaxAct to prepare and file their taxes or those of their clients. TaxAct generates revenue primarily through its digital service at www.TaxAct.com and its mobile applications. 
Business Overview
We have two reportable segments: (1) the Wealth Management segment and (2) the Tax Preparation segment. 
Wealth Management Business
Through its registered broker-dealer, registered investment advisor, and insurance agency subsidiaries, Avantax Wealth Management operates the largest U.S. tax-focused independent broker-dealer, providing tax-smart wealth management solutions to financial advisors and their clients nationwide.
Avantax works with a nationwide network of nearly 4,000 advisors that operate as independent contractors. Avantax provides these advisors with an integrated platform of technical, practice, and product support tools to assist in making each financial advisor a comprehensive financial service center for his or her clients. 
Unlike traditional independent broker-dealers and investment advisors whose client relationships are limited to providing investment advice, most Avantax advisors have long-standing tax advisory relationships that anchor their wealth management businesses. This is because Avantax primarily recruits and serves independent tax professionals, CPA firms, and financial advisors who partner with established tax practices. We believe that tax and accounting professionals, with their existing client relationships and in-depth knowledge of their clients’ financial situations, possess a competitive advantage as their tax advisory relationships provide a large base of potential wealth management clients. This results in an experienced and stable network of financial advisors who are ideally positioned to provide tailored and comprehensive financial solutions that enable clients to meet their financial goals, including their tax goals. In turn, our advisors have multiple revenue-generating options to diversify their earnings sources.
To help tax and accounting professionals integrate wealth management services into their practice, we offer specialized training and support that introduces advisors to the investment business and helps them build their practices. The comprehensive training curriculum is administered through numerous outlets, including an annual national sales conference, numerous local training events, and on-demand learning paths.
Blucora, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K 

Once advisors have integrated wealth management into their practices, Avantax provides an open-architecture investment platform and technology tools to help financial advisors identify investment opportunities for their clients. In addition, Avantax supports its advisors through its proprietary Tax-Smart Investing platform, which is designed to help advisors systematically capture tax-alpha (i.e., the incremental performance an investor can achieve, relative to market returns, by taking advantage of available tax-saving strategies) for clients by identifying tax savings opportunities in an advisor’s client base and automating the capture of that opportunity.
Avantax also has a highly experienced home office team that is focused on developing and delivering solutions tailored to each advisor’s practice. The home office team provides marketing, practice management, product support, wealth management, retirement services, compliance, succession planning, and other support to our advisors.
Avantax primarily generates revenue through securities and insurance commissions, quarterly investment advisory fees based on advisory assets, product marketing service agreements, and other agreements and fees. We regularly review the commissions and fees we charge for these products and services based on the evolving regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate and as a result of changes in client preferences and needs. For additional information on the Wealth Management segment’s revenues, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2.” 
Tax Preparation Business
TaxAct, a leading provider of digital tax preparation solutions, has leveraged its strong brand, comprehensive suite of tax preparation solutions, and proven digital lead generation capabilities to enable the filing of more than 68 million federal consumer tax returns since 2000. TaxAct operates as the value player in its market, with a mission to empower people to navigate the complexities of tax preparation with ease and accuracy at a fair price.
In addition to TaxAct’s core offerings, TaxAct offers ancillary services such as refund payment transfer, audit defense, stored value cards, gift cards and retirement investment accounts through Avantax, as well as presenting customers the option to review and take advantage of personalized tax and potential financial savings opportunities offered through third party product providers. We believe that TaxAct’s established brand and reputation is attractive to customers.
TaxAct had five offerings for consumers for tax year 2018, which is the basis for its 2019 operating results: 

• | A “free” federal and state edition that handled simple returns;


• | A “basic” offering that offered features for filers with dependents or college expenses;


• | A “deluxe” offering that contained all of the basic offering features in addition to tools to maximize credits and deductions, as well as tools for homeowners;


• | A “premier” offering that contained all of the deluxe offering features in addition to tools for investments, rental property, and prioritized support; and


• | A “self-employed” offering for independent contractors and self-employed filers.

For TaxAct’s offerings, free state returns may be filed for free federal filers or through the separately sold state edition. TaxAct also had offerings for small business owners and included separate offerings for sole proprietors, partnerships, C corporations, and S corporations.
TaxAct’s professional tax preparer software allows professional tax preparers to prepare and file individual and business returns for their clients. TaxAct offers flexible pricing and packaging options that help tax professionals save money by paying only for the specific services that they need. In addition, the professional tax preparer software includes valuable features that tax professionals count on to maximize their efficiency and productivity, including the option of entering data directly into tax forms, utilizing a question-and-answer interview method to enter data, or easily toggling between the two data entry methods.

Our History
Blucora was formed in 1996 as a Delaware corporation under the name InfoSpace, Inc. (“InfoSpace”). Significant events in Blucora’s history include:

• | In 2008, InfoSpace began principally focusing on internet search services and content (our “Search and Content” business).


• | In January 2012, InfoSpace acquired TaxAct. In connection with this acquisition, InfoSpace changed its name to Blucora, Inc. in June 2012.


• | In August 2013, Blucora acquired Monoprice, Inc. (“Monoprice”), an e-commerce company that sold self-branded electronics and accessories to both consumers and businesses (our “E-Commerce” business).


• | In July 2015, Blucora acquired SimpleTax Software Inc. (“SimpleTax”), a provider of digital tax preparation services for individuals in Canada.


• | In December 2015, Blucora acquired HD Vest, a provider of wealth management and advisory solutions specifically for tax professionals, and announced its plans to focus on the technology-enabled financial solutions market (the “Strategic Transformation”). The Strategic Transformation refers to our transformation into a technology-enabled financial solutions company comprised of TaxAct and HD Vest.


• | As part of the Strategic Transformation, we divested our Search and Content business in August 2016 and our E-Commerce business in November 2016. We subsequently relocated our corporate headquarters from Bellevue, Washington to Irving, Texas in 2017.


• | On May 6, 2019, we closed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of 1st Global, Inc. and 1st Global Insurance Services, Inc. (together, “1st Global”), a tax-focused wealth management company, for a cash purchase price of $180.0 million (the “1st Global Acquisition”). The 1st Global Acquisition was strategically important as it expands our presence as the leading tax-focused independent broker-dealer while also providing the scale to compete more broadly in the wealth management market. The operations of 1st Global are included in our operating results as part of the Wealth Management segment from the date of the 1st Global Acquisition.


• | Following an evaluation of the Tax Preparation business’s strategic initiatives, including which aspects of the Tax Preparation business were considered non-core strategies, on September 4, 2019, we completed the disposition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of SimpleTax for proceeds of $9.6 million. This amount was received in the third quarter of 2019, resulting in a $3.3 million gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 2019. Prior to its sale, SimpleTax was a component of our Tax Preparation business.


• | On September 9, 2019, we announced a rebranding of our Wealth Management business to Avantax Wealth Management (the “Rebranding”). In connection with the Rebranding, HD Vest (which comprised all of the Wealth Management business prior to the 1st Global Acquisition) was renamed Avantax Wealth Management in mid-September 2019, and 1st Global converted in late October 2019. The Rebranding is designed to bring broader awareness to our Tax-Smart wealth management approach, providing tax-focused wealth management advice with technology-advantaged tools, allowing our financial advisors to easily provide Tax-Smart wealth solutions to their clients.

Recent Developments
HKFS Acquisition
On January 6, 2020, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Honkamp Krueger Financial Services, Inc. (“HKFS”), the selling stockholders named therein (the “Sellers”), and 
Blucora, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K 

JRD Seller Representative, LLC, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of HKFS for a cash purchase price of $160 million (the “HKFS Acquisition”). HKFS is a registered investment advisor and wealth management business that partners with CPA firms in order to provide their consumer and small business clients with holistic planning and financial advisory services. The purchase price is expected to be paid with an incremental loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined herein), which is anticipated to be entered into on or about the time of the closing of the HKFS Acquisition. The HKFS Acquisition is expected to close around the end of the first quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. The HKFS Acquisition was not reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. For additional information, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 18.”
Leadership Changes
On January 6, 2020, Davinder Athwal resigned from his roles as Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the Company, while agreeing to stay on with the Company until January 31, 2020. In connection with Mr. Athwal’s resignation, Stacy Murray, who serves as the Company’s Principal Accounting Officer through her position as Chief Accounting Officer, assumed the duties of serving as the Company’s Principal Financial Officer in an interim capacity. 
On January 10, 2020, John Clendening, who served as our President and Chief Executive Officer, and also as a member of the Board, departed from his roles as an officer, employee, and director of the Company. 
On January 30, 2020, the Company announced that the Board appointed Christopher W. Walters to serve as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 30, 2020, with Mr. Walters continuing to serve as a member of the Board following his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer. 
Industry Trends
In the wealth management industry, we believe that Avantax is and will be the beneficiary of several expected positive industry trends, including growth of investable assets driven by baby boomers’ retirement accounts, a continued migration to independent advisor channels, liquidity events, and a continued shift toward household use of fee-based financial advisors. 
In the tax preparation industry, TaxAct participates in the consumer DDIY tax preparation solutions market, which is the fastest growing segment in the tax preparation industry and is bolstered by a growing millennial population that continues to adopt technology-enabled financial solutions that drive value and ease in their everyday lives, and we believe that tax simplification will drive digital consumer growth. 
Growth Strategy
Our growth strategies for our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses are grounded in the belief that the best way to sustainably grow a business is to earn loyalty based on continuously delivering ever-greater value to our customers and clients. We believe our growth strategies for Avantax and TaxAct will result in customer, client, and advisor retention and growth beyond that of the broader markets in which we operate. These strategies include:

• | In the Wealth Management business, we will accelerate organic growth as the largest tax-focused broker-dealer by:


• | Recruiting high potential tax firms as financial advisors and investing in the training and support to make them successful, including the rollout of regional support teams and the introduction of a comprehensive training and support program for new advisors, Avantax University.


• | Providing practice management and coaching to our advisors to grow their businesses and client base.


• | Continually evaluating and expanding our product suite to provide the best wealth management solutions for our advisors and their clients.


• | Delivering advisory products and services to increase client assets held on our platform.

Blucora, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K 


• | Driving integrations by aligning systems, processes and technologies, while applying product, technology, and data analytics to identify and capture asset growth opportunities.


• | Continuing to enhance and optimize service and support for advisors.


• | In the Tax Preparation business, we will create continued growth and momentum by:


• | Continuing to invest in our core product experience based on direct customer feedback and research to create delightful experiences for our customers.


• | Differentiating the TaxAct experience with unique product capabilities and features that reinforce our brand’s deep expertise in tax.


• | Developing new and cost-effective marketing strategies to drive acquisition of new customers.


• | Appealing to a large, attitudinal segment that is looking for a forward-leaning approach to improve their financial position.


• | Innovating new solutions and models that expand the DDIY category.


• | Providing ancillary services and partnerships to our customers that enhance our value and brand promise.


• | Creating year-long engagement with customers to improve retention.


• | Build Tax-Smart Leadership. A key element of our business model is to leverage tax information, which we believe enables clients and advisors to better achieve their financial goals and uncover potential opportunities for clients by delivering technology-enabled tax-smart solutions and financial insights.

For example, in our Wealth Management business, we believe our proprietary Tax-Smart Investing platform will provide our advisors the ability to consistently tax-optimize investor portfolios.
Investors unnecessarily forgo significant performance each year by not employing tax-alpha strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting, optimizing asset location, and intelligent asset drawdown. Our Tax-Smart Investing platform is designed to help advisors systematically capture tax-alpha for clients across multiple accounts. This unique approach is designed to identify the top opportunities in an advisor’s client base every day and help automate the capture of that opportunity in a fraction of the time. 
In June 2019, we launched the first tool on our Tax-Smart Investing platform, the patent pending Tax-Loss Harvester. Designed to work in the background of a financial professional’s practice, Tax-Loss Harvester can quickly identify clients’ securities with unrealized losses for potential harvesting opportunities. This powerful tax-smart strategy is now scalable across multiple clients in a fraction of the time and can potentially help turn losses into a client’s tax advantage. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we successfully launched the second tool on our Tax-Smart Investing platform, the patent pending Capital Gains Analyzer. Strategically developed with a focus on year-end planning opportunities, the Capital Gains Analyzer quickly collects, organizes, and calculates available mutual fund capital gain distribution estimates, as well as their potential tax impact, before year end. This efficiency further enables financial professionals to focus on planning and tax-optimized decisions as opposed to data gathering. In addition, our first planned technology launch for 2020, which has already begun beta testing, is our patent pending Social Security Planner. While Social Security is typically a fundamental component of a client’s retirement plan, the strategy options available can often be quite complex and confusing to the average retiree. The Social Security Planner will be able to show clients a comprehensive analysis of their Social Security benefit claiming options, thus enabling them to make informed decisions that support their retirement goals. 

• | One Blucora. A key objective of our strategy is to continue to enable efficiencies and cross-business synergies through shared services and expertise across our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses. We believe that building a high-performing organization that attracts, retains, develops, and engages the strongest talent will drive a shared purpose and common culture.

Blucora, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K 


• | Deliver Results. Our goal is to drive continuous improvement by focusing on specific financial metrics that drive the organization and allow us to meet our stated goals and targets. These key metrics currently include revenue growth, net income growth, adjusted EBITDA growth, and non-GAAP net income growth. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, including definitions, see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Seasonality
The Tax Preparation segment is highly seasonal, with a significant portion of its annual revenue earned in the first four months of the fiscal year. During the third and fourth quarters, the Tax Preparation segment typically reports losses because revenue from the segment is minimal while core operating expenses continue. 
Competition
The markets in which our businesses operate continue to evolve and are highly competitive. For our businesses to be successful, we must effectively compete in the wealth management and tax preparation markets, as described in more detail below.
Wealth Management Competition
The wealth management industry is a highly competitive and fragmented global industry. We and our financial advisors compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including traditional wirehouses, independent broker-dealers, registered investment advisors (including CPA firms that have their own in-house registered investment advisor), asset managers, banks and insurance companies, direct distributors, and larger broker-dealers. These competitors may have greater financial, technological, and marketing resources, broader infrastructure and distribution networks, greater brand recognition, and broader product and service offerings. We and our financial advisors compete directly with these financial institutions for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for recruitment and retention of financial advisors. 
We believe that our competitive position in the wealth management industry is a function of providing effective service and tools to tax professionals, while understanding the needs of these tax professionals with respect to wealth management, in order to maximize the opportunity to create tax-advantaged financial planning and advice. More specifically, we endeavor to:

• | offer broad and comprehensive wealth solutions that address a client’s accumulation, income, and protection needs across their entire lives;


• | offer a differentiated value proposition (in terms of brand recognition, reputation, and financial advisor payouts) in order to recruit and retain financial advisors;


• | offer products and technology solutions that are attractive to financial advisors and their clients;


• | negotiate competitive compensation arrangements with third parties, including vendors, suppliers, and product sponsors;


• | ensure the privacy and security of personal client information submitted to our financial advisors;


• | develop and react to new technology, services, and regulation in the financial services industry; and


• | establish an efficient support and service network for our financial advisors and clients.

Tax Preparation Competition
The market for tax preparation products and services continues to evolve and is highly competitive. We experience significant competition and expect this competitive environment to continue. We encounter direct competition from numerous other tax preparation software products and digital services. These competitors include Intuit’s TurboTax and H&R Block’s DDIY consumer products and services, which currently have a significant 
Blucora, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K 

percentage of the software and digital service market. We also encounter competition from alternate methods of tax preparation such as storefront tax preparation services, which includes both local tax preparers and large chains such as H&R Block, Liberty Tax, and Jackson Hewitt, and it may also be subject to new market entrants who may take some of our market share. Finally, our TaxAct business faces the risk that state or federal taxing agencies will offer software or systems to provide direct access for individual filers that will reduce the need for TaxAct’s software and services. 
We believe that our competitive position in the market for tax preparation software and services is a function of our ability to differentiate our brand versus those of our competitors by the following:

• | optimizing or minimizing the taxes paid by each of our customers;


• | offering competitive pricing;


• | continuing to offer reliable, easy-to-use, and accessible software and services that are compelling to consumers;


• | offering software that is backed by financial and tax-expertise;


• | ensuring the privacy and security of user data submitted through our products;


• | marketing our software and services in a cost-effective way; and


• | offering ancillary services that are attractive to users.

Governmental Regulation
Blucora is a publicly traded company that is subject to SEC and NASDAQ Global Select Market rules and regulations regarding public disclosure, financial reporting, internal controls, and corporate governance. Our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation segments are subject to federal and state government requirements, including regulations related to consumer protection, user privacy, security, pricing, taxation, intellectual property, labor, advertising, broker-dealers, securities, investment advisors, asset management, insurance, listing standards, and product and services quality.
Our Wealth Management segment is subject to additional financial industry regulations and supervision, including by the SEC, FINRA, the Department of Labor (“DOL”), state securities and insurance regulators, and other regulatory authorities. Our Wealth Management subsidiary Avantax Investment Services, Inc. is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, a member of FINRA, and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Broker-dealers and their representatives are subject to rules and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, the conduct of directors, officers, and employees, and general anti-fraud provisions. Broker-dealers and their representatives are also regulated by state securities administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Compliance with many of the rules and regulations applicable to us involves a number of risks, because rules and regulations frequently change and are subject to varying interpretations, among other reasons. Regulators make periodic examinations of our broker-dealer operations and review annual, monthly, and other reports on our operations and financial condition. Violations of rules and regulations governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the restriction, suspension, or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer, its representatives or its officers or employees, or other similar adverse consequences.
Our Wealth Management subsidiary, Avantax Advisory Services, Inc., is registered with the SEC as a registered investment advisor and is subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, advisory fees, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between the advisor and advisory clients, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, and general anti-fraud provisions. The SEC periodically examines our investment advisor operations and reviews annual, monthly, and other reports on our operations and financial condition. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and other federal securities laws, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment advisor’s registration. Investment advisor representatives also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the Advisers Act or other federal and state securities 
Blucora, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K 

laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, profit disgorgement, fines, or other similar adverse consequences.
Our Wealth Management subsidiaries offer certain products and services subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and to regulations promulgated under ERISA or the Code, insofar as they provide services with respect to plan clients, or otherwise deal with plan clients that are subject to ERISA or the Code. ERISA imposes certain duties on persons who are “fiduciaries” (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) and prohibits certain transactions involving plans subject to ERISA and fiduciaries or other service providers to such plans. Non-compliance with these provisions may expose an ERISA fiduciary or other service provider to liability under ERISA, which may include monetary penalties as well as equitable remedies for the affected plan. Section 4975 of the Code prohibits certain transactions involving plans (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, which includes individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans) and service providers, including fiduciaries, to such plans. Section 4975 of the Code imposes excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions. 
On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest (“Reg. BI”), elevating the standard of care for broker-dealers from the current “suitability” requirement to a “best interest” standard when making a recommendation of any securities transaction to a retail customer. The “best interest” standard requires a broker-dealer to make recommendations without putting its financial interests ahead of the interests of a retail customer. The SEC also adopted Form CRS Relationship Summary (“Form CRS”), which requires registered investment advisors (“RIAs”) and broker-dealers to deliver to retail investors a succinct, plain English summary about the relationship and services provided by the firm and the required standard of conduct associated with the relationship and services. In connection with adopting Reg. BI, the SEC added new record-making and recordkeeping rules. The compliance date for Reg. BI and the related rules is June 30, 2020. Reg. BI heightens the standard of care for broker-dealers when making investment recommendations and would impose disclosure and policy and procedural obligations that could impact the compensation our Wealth Management business and its representatives receive for selling certain types of products, particularly those that offer different compensation across different share classes (such as mutual funds and variable annuities). In addition, Reg. BI prohibits a broker-dealer and its associated persons from using the term “adviser” or “advisor” if the broker-dealer is not an RIA or the associated person is not a supervised person of an RIA. This prohibition requires us to change the titles of certain of our advisors. The implementation of the regulations will require us to create, review and modify certain policies and procedures and review and change the products that we offer, and also will result in associated increases in training and supervisory and compliance controls, all of which may lead to additional costs and decreased revenue. In addition to the SEC, various states have proposed or are considering adopting laws and regulations seeking to impose new standards of conduct on broker-dealers that, as written, differ from the SEC’s new regulations and may lead to additional implementation costs if adopted. For further discussion of the risks to our business related to Reg. BI, see the paragraph in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the heading “Our Wealth Management business is subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with these regulations or interpretations thereof could have a Material Adverse Effect.”
Our Tax Preparation segment is subject to federal and state government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. We are also required to comply with Federal Trade Commission requirements and a variety of state revenue agency standards. In addition, we offer certain other products and services to small businesses and consumers, which are also subject to regulatory requirements. As we expand our products and services, we may become subject to additional government regulation. Further, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours or expand to cover additional products and services. These increased regulatory requirements could impose higher regulatory compliance costs, limitations on our ability to provide some services in some states or countries, and liabilities that might be incurred through lawsuits or regulatory penalties. 
We are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may have an impact on our operations.
See the section entitled “Risks Associated With Our Businesses” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding governmental regulation of our business and risks related to such regulation.
Blucora, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K 

Privacy and Security of Customer Information and Transactions
Regulatory activity in the areas of privacy and data protection continues to grow worldwide, driven in part by the growth of technology and related concerns about the rapid and widespread dissemination and use of information. To the extent they are applicable to us, we must comply with various federal, state, and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider regulatory requirements relating to the privacy and security of the personal information of our customers and employees. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, federal and state labor and employment laws, state data breach notification laws, and state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, SEC Regulation S-P, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, and Regulation S-ID, and further potential federal and state requirements.
Many of these laws and regulations provide consumers and employees with a private right of action if a covered company suffers a data breach related to a failure to implement reasonable data security measures. In addition, we are subject to other privacy laws and regulations that apply to internet advertising, online behavioral tracking, mobile applications, messaging, telemarketing, email communication, data hosting, data retention, financial and health information, and credit reporting. The legal framework around privacy issues is rapidly evolving, as various federal and state government bodies are considering adopting new privacy laws and regulations, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store, or transmit the personal information and other data of our customers or employees. These laws could also affect the ways we communicate with our customers, deliver products and services, and could significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to new industry segments or otherwise becomes subject to rules and regulations of jurisdictions outside the United States with stricter data protection regimes, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, our compliance requirements and costs will increase. 
Through a privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with the principles of individual consent, data subject access, and privacy-by-design, we strive to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of, and can control, how we use personal information about them. The TaxAct.com website and its digital products have been certified by TRUSTe, an independent organization that offers certification to organizations that have demonstrated responsible data collection and processing practices consistent with regulatory expectations and external standards for privacy accountability. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to influence public policy, for privacy and security.
To address data security concerns, we use standard data security safeguards to help protect our computer systems and the information customers give to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers transmit credit card information or tax return data to us through one of our websites or products, we use industry-standard encryption as the data is transmitted to us. We work to protect our computer systems from unauthorized internal or external access using commercially-available computer security products as well as internally-developed security procedures and practices.

Our success depends upon our technology and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect such rights and the value of our corporate brands and reputation through a variety of measures, including: domain name registrations, confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with employees and third parties, protective contractual provisions, and laws regarding copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. We hold multiple registered trademarks in the United States and in various foreign countries, and we may apply for additional trademarks as business needs require.
