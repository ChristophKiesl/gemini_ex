Item 1. Description of Business
General
 
We were incorporated on May 15, 2018 in the State of Nevada. We are a technology holding company previously with a focus on pandemic management products and services and currently seeking other opportunities. The Company looks to license & acquire technology that improves life and works with partners to develop cutting edge, “smart” products for a variety of markets. From inception until the date of this filing our activities have primarily consisted of (i) the incorporation of our company, (ii) the development of our business plan, (iii) development of various products, (iv) recruiting and adding additional consultants and employees, (v) signing contracts for the business, and (vi) advancing the sale of PPE products through numerous sources.
 
Our business office is located at 6605 Abercorn, Suite 204, Savannah, GA 31405. Our telephone number is 912-253-0375 and our website is www.hawkeyesystemsinc.com.
 
Business Description
 
In July 2021, the Company determined to cease operations of its PPE business since continued business in that sector was not a productive use of the Company’s resources. 
 
Our current business plan is to serve as a vehicle for the acquisition of or merger or consolidation with another company (a “target business”). We intend to use capital stock, debt or a combination of these to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe has significant growth potential. The business combination may be with a financially stable, mature company or a company that is in its early stages of development or growth, which could include companies seeking to obtain capital and to improve their financial stability.
 
We will not restrict our search to any particular industry. Rather, we may investigate businesses of essentially any kind or nature and participate in any type of business that may, in our management’s opinion, meet our business objectives as described in this report. We emphasize that the description in this report of our business objectives is extremely general and is not meant to restrict the discretion of our management to search for and enter potential business opportunities. We have not chosen the business in which we will engage and have not conducted any market studies with respect to any business or industry for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business or the industry in which we may ultimately operate. To the extent we enter into a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we will become subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, to the extent that we effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we will become subject to the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. An extremely high level of risk frequently characterizes certain industries that experience rapid growth. In addition, although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Sources of target businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers, and other members of the financial community, who may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. Our officers and directors and their affiliates may also bring to our attention target business candidates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage such firms in the future, in which event, we may pay a finder’s fee or other compensation for such introductions if they result in consummated transactions. These fees are customarily between 1% and 5% of the size of the overall transaction, based upon a sliding scale of the amount involved.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of a business combination
 
Our management will have significant flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management will consider, among other factors, the following:
 

• | the financial condition and results of operation of the target; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the growth potential of the target and that of the industry in which the target operates;


4


• | the experience and skill of the target’s management and availability of additional personnel; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the capital requirements of the target; 
• | the competitive position of the target; 
• | the stage of development that the target’s products, processes, or services are at; 
• | the degree of current or potential market acceptance of the target’s products, processes, or services;


• | proprietary features and the degree of intellectual property or other protection of the target’s products, processes, or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the regulatory environment of the industry in which the target operates; 
• | the prospective equity interest in, and opportunity for control of, the target; and 
• | the costs associated with effecting the business combination. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in connection with effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business, we anticipate that we will conduct an extensive due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial or other information that will be made available to us.
 
We will endeavor to structure a business combination to achieve the most favorable tax treatment to us, the target business and both companies’ stockholders. We cannot assure you, however, that the Internal Revenue Service or appropriate state tax authority will agree with our tax treatment of the business combination.
 
Until we are presented with a specific opportunity for a business combination, we are unable to ascertain with any degree of certainty the time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination. We have two full-time employees devoting their time to our affairs. Any costs incurred in connection with the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital otherwise available to complete a business combination.
 
Limited ability to evaluate the target business’ management
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business before effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target’s management will prove to be correct, especially considering the possible inexperience of our officers and directors in evaluating certain types of businesses. In addition, we cannot assure you that the target’s future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications, or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our officers and directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs after a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the target business.
 
We may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to recruit additional managers who have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Investment Company Act
 
We may participate in a business or opportunity by purchasing, trading, or selling the securities of a business. We do not intend to engage primarily in these activities, and we are not registered as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We do not believe that registration under the act is required based upon our proposed activities. We intend to conduct our activities so as to avoid being classified as an “investment company” and avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act and its regulations.
 
The Investment Company Act may, however, also be deemed to be applicable to a company that does not intend to be characterized as an “investment company” but that, nevertheless, engages in activities that may be deemed to be within the definitional scope of certain provisions of the Investment Company Act. While we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act, we cannot assure you that we will not be deemed to be an “investment company,” especially during the period prior to a business combination. In the event we are deemed to be an “investment company,” we may become subject to certain restrictions relating to our activities and regulatory burdens, including:
 

• | restrictions on the nature of our investments; and
--+---------------------------------------------------
• | the issuance of securities, 

 
and have imposed upon us certain requirements, including:
 

• | registration as an investment company; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and 
• | compliance with certain burdensome reporting, recordkeeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.

 
In the event we are characterized as an “investment company,” we would be required to comply with these additional regulatory burdens, which would require additional expense.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The company currently does not have IP and this is not part of our current strategy.
 
Regulation
 
In our current business we are subject to local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations. Upon completion of an acquisition, we will have significant additional regulation based on the nature of the business.
Prior Investment in Radiant Images, Inc.
 
On September 19, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Radiant Images, Inc., a California corporation (“Radiant”), as well as Radiant’s shareholder Gianna Wolfe (“Wolfe”) and key employee, Michael Mansouri (“Mansouri”), pursuant to which the Company would acquire 100% of the shares of common stock (the “Shares”) of Radiant from Wolfe, resulting in acquisition of Radiant.
 
In April 2020, the Company received notice from Radiant Images of their intent to terminate the acquisition agreement. Although the Company believes that the termination is not legally valid, the Company has ceased further discussions with respect to the acquisition and is pursuing litigation for repayment of amounts due by Radiant. The Company’s investment in Radiant was structured as a revolving note has been classified as a Note Receivable from Radiant due with accrued but unpaid interest. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving note, Radiant is required to repay the money already invested to Hawkeye with interest. The note receivable was issued on April 26, 2019, is due upon demand of the Company at any time commencing April 26, 2020. We have made that demand. The interest rate on the note is 12% and accrues daily on the outstanding balance. Contributions of $385,000 were made to Radiant, bringing the balance of the note receivable to $1,305,800 at June 30, 2020 (not including interest). At June 30, 2020 interest income of $154,042 had been accrued on the note. Under accounting treatment, this note and interest are impaired on our balance sheet while we undertake litigation to resolve this dispute. We have filed a complaint against Radiant and its principals and intend to vigorously pursue this matter and litigation and believes that this amount is fully collectible from Radiant and/or its principals.

Legal Proceedings
 
On November 13, 2019 5W Public Relations LLC filed a complaint against Hawkeye Systems, Inc. relating to payments allegedly due under a contract for public relations services. Hawkeye vigorously disputes the allegations in the complaint as 5W Public Relations provided virtually no services to Hawkeye during the term of this arrangement but was paid a substantial amount of funds. Hawkeye will not only defend the litigation, but has also engaged counsel to provide counterclaims for failure of consideration, fraud in the inducement, general fraud, and other causes of action. Hawkeye anticipates that this litigation will be resolved favorably for the Company.
