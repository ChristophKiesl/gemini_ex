Product Lines
 
Antenna Products PCTEL designs and manufactures precision antennas and we offer in-house wireless product development for our customers, including design, testing, radio integration, and manufacturing capabilities. PCTEL antennas are deployed in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in equipment and devices for the Industrial Internet of Things. Revenue growth in these markets is driven by the increased use and complexity of wireless communications. Consistent with our mission to solve complex network engineering problems and in order to compete effectively in the antenna market, PCTEL maintains expertise in the following areas: radio frequency engineering, digital signal process (“DSP”) engineering, wireless network engineering, mechanical engineering, mobile antenna design, manufacturing, and product quality and testing.  We seek out product applications that command a premium for product design and performance, and we avoid commodity markets.  Our antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution.  
Test & Measurement Products PCTEL provides radio frequency (“RF”) test & measurement tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally, with a focus on LTE, public safety, and 5G technologies. Network operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on our scanning receivers and testing solutions to analyze, design, and optimize next generation wireless networks.  Revenue growth in this market is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e. 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G).  Consistent with our mission to solve complex network engineering problems and in order to compete effectively in the RF test & measurement market, PCTEL maintains expertise in the following areas: radio frequency engineering, DSP engineering, wireless network engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing, and product quality and testing.  Our test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers.

Major Customers
 There were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018.
 The following table represents customers that accounted for 10% or more of total trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2019 and 2018:
 
 
 | As of December 31,
--------------------------+-------------------
Trade Accounts Receivable | 2019 | 2018
Customer A | 15% | 9% 
Customer B | 11% | 1% 
Customer C | 8% | 13% 

Backlog
 Sales of our products are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders, which are officially acknowledged according to standard terms and conditions.  The backlog of customer purchase orders is useful for scheduling production but is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future product revenues as the order to ship cycle is short.  The February 2020 work stoppage at our manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China, and at our contract manufacturers’ facilities, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, will increase the backlog of customer purchase orders for the near future.
Research and Development
 Given that the Company’s mission is to solve complex RF problems for our customers, research and development is essential to our long-term success. We work closely with our customers, consultants and market research organizations to monitor and predict changes in the wireless industry, including emerging industry standards.  We continue to make substantial investments in engineering, talent, research and development and we devote substantial resources to product development, innovation, and patent submissions.  We have over 100 patents in the U.S. and other countries worldwide.  The patent submissions are primarily for defensive purposes, rather than for potential license revenue generation.  
Sales, Marketing and Support
 Our marketing strategy is focused on
 building market awareness and acceptance of our new products.  In 2019, the Company increased the headcount in its marketing department to centralize and focus its marketing efforts.  The Company’s sales function is managed under the Chief Sales Officer who has primary responsibility for revenue generation and oversight of the worldwide sales force.   PCTEL’s direct sales force is technologically sophisticated with many sales personnel having college degrees in engineering and sales executives having strong industry domain knowledge.  We supply our products to public and private carriers, wireless infrastructure providers, wireless equipment distributors, value added resellers (“VARs”) and OEMs.  Our direct sales force supports the sales efforts of our distributors and OEM resellers.
Manufacturing
 We have historically done final assembly of most of our antenna products in-house at our facilities in Tianjin, China, and Bloomingdale, Illinois.  In order to optimize the cost structure of our antenna product line, increase our competitiveness, and reduce our fixed costs in China, we are in the process of transitioning several product lines from our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere.  We expect to be substantially complete with the transition by the end of fiscal year 2020.  We do final assembly of all of our test & measurement product in-house at our facility in Clarksburg, Maryland. 
 By transitioning some of our manufacturing to multiple contract manufacturers with a variety of expertise, we avoid becoming dependent on any specific contract manufacturer.  If any contract manufacturer is unable to provide timely or satisfactory services for us, our other contract manufacturers will be available, provided, however, that transitioning production to a different  contract manufacturer could cause delays, disruption and additional costs that could negatively impact timely delivery of our products and our earnings therefrom.  We have no material guaranteed supply contracts or long-term agreements with any of our suppliers, but we do have open purchase orders with several of our suppliers.  See the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section of Note 6 for information on purchase commitments.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, we had 331 full-time equivalent employees, consisting of 197 in operations, 55 in research and development, 48 in sales and marketing, and 31 in general and administrative functions.  Total full-time equivalent employees were 454 at December 31, 2018.  Headcount decreased by 123 during 2019 primarily due to a reduction in operations headcount in our Tianjin facility.  The headcount reduction in the Tianjin facility resulted from the transition of the final assembly of some of our antenna products to contract manufacturers, as indicated in the section titled “Manufacturing” above, and from decreased demand from some of our China-based

customers, particularly for our small cell products which are manufactured in our Tianjin facility.  All our employees in Tianjin, China are represented by a labor union, and our employees in Beijing, China are represented by a separate labor union pursuant to the requirements of China’s National Labor Law.  These two labor unions do not have collective bargaining rights.  During 2019 we negotiated severance arrangements with the Tianjin-based employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union.
