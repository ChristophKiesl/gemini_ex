Item 1. Business.
Overview



We are a blank check company incorporated on August 20, 2020, in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. Since our initial public offering (as described below), we have focused our search for an initial business combination on businesses that may provide significant opportunities for attractive investor returns.
Initial Public Offering



On November 12, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 9,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, one right and one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one Class A ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination, and with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $90,000,000.




Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 479,000 units, 414,000 of which were sold to our sponsor and 65,000 of which were sold to I-Bankers, at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $4,790,000.



A total of $91,530,000 from the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the private placement units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



Our management team is led by Kevin Chen, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Ai, our Chief Financial Officer and Director, who collectively have expertise in nearly all facets of the healthcare sector and strong expertise in investment management. Christine Zhao served as our Chief Financial Officer and a Director of the Company from September 2020 to October 2022.



We must complete our initial business combination by February 12, 2023. If our initial business combination is not consummated by February 12, 2023 and we do not obtain a further extension of time from our shareholders, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.



Termination of the Calidi Merger Agreement

On August 11, 2022, the Company received written notice that Calidi Biotherapeutics, Inc. had terminated the Merger Agreement. As a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement was of no further force and effect, and certain agreements entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement, including but not limited to, the Voting Agreement and Lock-Up Agreement, were no longer in force or effect. 
The AOI Merger Agreement 



This section describes the material provisions of the AOI Merger Agreement but does not purport to describe all of the terms thereof. The following summary of the AOI Merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the AOI Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1. Shareholders of the Company and other interested parties are urged to read the AOI Merger Agreement in its entirety. Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used below have the meanings given to them in the AOI Merger Agreement.
General Description of the Merger Agreement 



On December 5, 2022, the Company entered into the AOI Merger Agreement with AOI, Australian Oilseeds Holdings Limited, upon execution of a joinder agreement to become party to the Business Combination Agreement, a to-be-formed Cayman Islands exempted company (“Pubco”), AOI Merger Sub, Purchaser Representative, Seller Representative and Sellers.





1







Pursuant to the AOI Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the AOI Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), (a) the Company will merge with and into AOI Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”), and with holders of the Company’s securities receiving substantially identical securities of Pubco, and (b) immediately prior to the Merger, Pubco will acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of AOI (the “Purchased Shares”) from the Sellers in exchange for ordinary shares of Pubco, with AOI becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (the “Share Exchange”, and together with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Transactions”).



Exchange Consideration 



The total consideration to be paid by Pubco to the Sellers for the Purchased Shares shall be an aggregate number of Pubco ordinary shares (the “Exchange Shares”) with an aggregate value (the “Exchange Consideration”) equal to, without duplication, (i) $190,000,000, plus (or minus, if negative) (ii) AOI’s net working capital less a target net working capital of $4,000,000, minus (iii) the aggregate amount of any outstanding indebtedness, net of cash and cash equivalents, of AOI and its subsidiaries, and minus (iv) the amount of any unpaid transaction expenses of AOI, with each Pubco ordinary share to be issued to the Sellers valued at $10.00.



The Exchange Consideration is subject to adjustment after the Closing based on final confirmation of AOI’s net working capital, the outstanding indebtedness of AOI and its subsidiaries net of cash and cash equivalents, and any unpaid transaction expenses of AOI, as of the date of the Closing. If the finally determined number of Exchange Shares is (i) greater than the estimated number of Exchange Shares, Pubco will issue an additional number of Pubco ordinary shares equal to such difference to the Sellers, subject to a maximum amount equal to the amount of Escrow Property (defined below) at such time or (ii) less than the estimated number of Exchange Shares, Pubco will cause the Escrow Agent (as defined below) to release from escrow a number of Escrow Shares equal to such difference to Pubco, subject to a maximum amount equal to the Escrow Property at such time.



Escrow Accounts 



The parties agreed that at or prior to the Closing, Pubco, the Primary Sellers, the Purchaser Representative, the Seller Representative and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent” or “CST”) will enter into an Escrow Agreement, effective as of the Closing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and AOI (the “Escrow Agreement”), pursuant to which Pubco will deliver to the Escrow Agent a number of Exchange Shares equal to 15% of the estimated Exchange Consideration otherwise issuable to the Sellers at the Closing (such Exchange Shares, together with any equity securities paid as dividends or distributions with respect to such shares or into which such shares are exchanged or converted the “Escrow Shares”) to be held, along with any dividends, distributions or income thereon (together with the Escrow Shares, the “Escrow Property”) in a segregated account (the “Escrow Account”) and disbursed in accordance with the AOI Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Shares will be held in the Escrow Account for a period of 12 months after the Closing and shall be the sole and exclusive source of payment for any post-Closing purchase price adjustment and for any post-closing indemnification claims (other than certain fraud claims and breaches of AOI and the Sellers’ fundamental representations, as discussed below). At the 12-month anniversary of the Closing, all remaining Escrow Property will be released to the Sellers in accordance with the AOI Merger Agreement. However, an amount of Escrow Property equal to the value of any pending and unresolved claims will remain in the Escrow Account until finally resolved.
Representations and Warranties



The AOI Merger Agreement contains a number of representations and warranties by each of the Company, Pubco and AOI as of the date of the AOI Merger Agreement and as of the date of the Closing. Many of the representations and warranties are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect. “Material Adverse Effect” as used in the AOI Merger Agreement means with respect to any specified person or entity, any fact, event, occurrence, change or effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of such person or entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of such person or entity or any of its subsidiaries on a timely basis to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement or the ancillary documents thereto, subject to certain customary exceptions. Certain of the representations are subject to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the AOI Merger Agreement or in information provided pursuant to certain disclosure schedules to the AOI Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties made by the Company and AOI are customary for transactions similar to the AOI Merger.

Fraud claims with respect to the transactions under the AOI Merger Agreement or breaches by AOI or the Sellers of their fundamental representations are payable by the Primary Sellers up to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the Exchange Consideration.



Any indemnification claims against the indemnifying parties shall first be applied against the Escrow Shares and then against any other Escrow Property before the Primary Sellers shall be required to make any out-of-pocket payment for indemnification.

Our Business



Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 



We believe the health care sector has experienced a significant amount of change over the last several years. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on the healthcare sector remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic from time to time. However, we believe that these challenges may also lead to meaningful acquisition opportunities, such as the AOI Merger. In addition, we see long-term catalyst in accelerating the broader adoption of telemedicine.



We have employed a pro-active acquisition strategy focused on identifying potential business combination targets in the healthcare sector, as seen with the AOI Merger. Possible targets have included hospitals or hospital networks, specialty clinics chain, chronic disease health care service providers, telemedicine/digital health providers and/or associated technology/platform enablers, or artificial intelligence/big data enabled diagnostic providers. We believe strongly in our management team’s ability to add value from both an operating and a financing perspective which has been a key driver of past performance and we believe will continue to be central to its differentiated acquisition strategy.



Business Strategy



We seek to create compelling shareholder value by leveraging the track record, strong network, and complementary experience of our management team and sponsor affiliate, which includes experts in nearly all facets of the healthcare sector and strong expertise in investment management.



Our sponsor’s members, affiliates and contacts (“Affiliated Physicians”) comprise a significant network of physicians in the United States, Canada, and Europe with ties to the Asia-Pacific region. 38 of our sponsor’s members are physicians. Our sponsor’s relationship with the Society of Chinese American Physician Entrepreneurs (“SCAPE”) (approximately 445 physicians) and the World Association of Chinese Doctors (“WACD”) (over 20,000 physicians), represents a significant opportunity to source target business combinations and business relationships. Through our sponsor, SCAPE, and WACD, among other relationships, our member and affiliated physicians represent over 30 specialty fields of medicine, and represent practices located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and elsewhere.

Our Affiliated Physicians are employed by, have practice privileges, or other affiliations or appointments with leading medical institutions including the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, New York Presbyterian, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Kaiser Permanente, UCLA Medical Center, UCSF Medical Center, Stanford University, and Duke University.



Our Sponsor entered into an agreement in accordance with the guidelines of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, to place limit orders, through ED&F Man Capital Markets Inc., an independent broker-dealer registered under Section 15 of the Exchange Act which is not affiliated with us nor part of the underwriting or selling group, to purchase an aggregate of up to 3,750,000 of our rights in the open market at market prices, and not to exceed $0.20 per right during the period commencing on the later of (i) December 10, 2020, the date separate trading of the rights commenced or (ii) sixty calendar days after the end of the “restricted period” under Regulation M, continuing until the date that was the earlier of (a) November 9, 2021 and (b) the date that we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination, or earlier in certain circumstances as described in the limit order agreement. The limit orders required such members of our sponsor to purchase any rights offered for sale (and not purchased by another investor) at or below a price of $0.20, until the earlier of (x) the expiration of the buyback period or (y) the date such purchases reach 3,750,000 rights in total. Our sponsor would not have any discretion or influence with respect to such purchases and will not be able to sell or transfer any rights purchased in the open market pursuant to such agreements until following the consummation of a business combination. It was intended that the broker’s purchase obligation would be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M under the Exchange Act, which may prohibit or limit purchases pursuant to the limit order agreement in certain circumstances. I-Bankers also agreed to purchase up to 1,250,000 of our rights in the open market at market prices not to exceed $0.20 per right, on substantially similar terms as our sponsor. The obligations to make any such purchases expired on November 9, 2021, without any limit orders having been placed by our sponsor or I-Bankers.



Market Opportunity



Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating an initial business combination, we are focusing on businesses within the healthcare space in Asia-Pacific and North America with an overall transaction value between $300 million and $1.0 billion.



We believe the healthcare sector is well poised for strong growth over the long-term given aging demographic trends. Population growth, combined with increased economic power and efforts to expand public health systems, will likely result in higher health care spending. As care deferrals are reduced when the pandemic subsides the sector represents short-term attractive target markets given the size, breadth and prospects for growth.



According to Deloitte Insights 2020 Global Healthcare Outlook —




● | Health care spending is expected to rise at a CAGR of 5% over 2019 – 2023, up from 2.7% in 2014 – 2018 and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Global health care spending as a share of GDP will likely remain at around 10.2% through 2023, equal to 2018’s ratio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




According to Global Telemedicine Market Report 2022 – 2027, by 2027, the global telemedicine services is expected to reach $210 billion. The Global MD 2022 State of Telemedicine Report says that the percentage of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit increased from 42% in 2020 to 67% in 2021. to the Global MD 2022 State of Telemedicine Report, The percentage of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit increased from 42% in 2020 to 67% in 2021.to the Global MD 2022 State of Telemedicine Report, The percentage of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit increased from 42% in 2020 to 67% in 2021. to the Global MD 2022 State of Telemedicine Report, The percentage of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit increased from 42% in 2020 to 67% in 2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated digital adoption due to COVID-19 related quarantine and stay-at-home measures, need for social distancing, with telemedicine spending and usage expected to increase significantly from pre-COVID levels.



Strong Healthcare growth opportunities in Asia — There has been a significant gap in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP and healthcare service quality, creating what we believe to be a large degree of room for spending increases and enhancements in service standards in Asia.



Asian countries will likely contribute around half of global growth in high income households (Deloitte insights 2020 Global Healthcare Outlook).



We have not narrowed our business combination target to any particular healthcare business; however, we are exploring the following potential markets:




● | Telemedicine/digital health providers and/or associated technology/platform enablers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Artificial intelligence/big data enabled diagnostic providers or clinical data analytical platform provider; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Private hospitals and specialty clinic chains, in particular those with higher patient economics such as on oncology, orthopedics, dental, plastic surgery, rehabilitation and chronic disease management. These specialty hospitals/clinic chains tend to have higher patient concentrate/occupancy, larger treatment ticket size and better margin.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria



We have sought and will continue to seek to identify companies that have compelling market presence, growth potential and a combination of the following characteristics. We have used and continue to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire companies or assets that we believe have the following attributes:

● | Growth Potential: high growth history and future trajectory in revenue top line, above industry average;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive Position: Leading or growing market share compared to peer group;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Management Team: Talented, highly motivated, experienced with strong execution track record;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Profitability or visible path to profitability: Strong business economics and good operating results leading to profitability; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solid technology in digital and/or AI/big data-assisted healthcare applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.



Status as a Public Company



We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as AOI. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our shares or for a combination of shares of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See “The AOI Merger” above for more information regarding such exchange in the AOI Merger. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.





10







Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, such as the AOI Merger, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.



Financial Position



With funds available for an initial business combination initially in the amount of $21,319,155 (as of December 31, 2022), we offer a target business, such as AOI, a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from our initial public offering, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. Accordingly, our flexibility in structuring a business combination may be subject to these constraints.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our initial business combination, for an indefinite period of time. We intend to complete our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement units, our share capital debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working capital.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.





11







Sources of Target Businesses



We receive proprietary transaction opportunities as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and deal sourcing activities from the network built up by our management team and by the members of our Board. Target business candidates, such as AOI, have been brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private equity groups, large business enterprises, and other market participants. These sources introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus of our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Kevin Chen has agreed that if he becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that might be suitable to the Company’s business or investment strategy through his directorship in another blank check company, he will recuse himself from all discussions, deliberations, or decisions of the other blank check company with respect to such opportunity.



Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we are focusing our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the AOI management team, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the AOI Merger is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, including the AOI Merger, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. The determination as to whether any members of our board of directors will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.





12







Following a business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management endeavors to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we have conducted and will continue conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.





Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses



So long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, the target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. So long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, if we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account.





13







In order to consummate such an initial business combination, like the AOI Merger, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities (although our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we may not issue securities that can vote with ordinary shareholders on matters related to our pre-initial business combination activity). If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our shareholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our shareholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination.



We will structure our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination to acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business, but we will only consummate such business combination if we will become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes) or are otherwise not required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act. Even though we will own a majority interest in the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.



The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of AOI was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.



Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination



We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement (as is the case with the AOI Merger), or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.



Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example:




● | We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholder (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% of greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






14







The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:




● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




See “The AOI Merger” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the AOI Merger. 



Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination



On November 9, 2021, the Sponsor requested that the Company extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 12, 2021, to February 12, 2022. The extension was the first of up to two three-month extensions permitted under the Company’s prior governing documents. In connection with such extension, the sponsor caused an aggregate of $900,000 to be deposited into the Company’s trust account on November 10, 2021.



On February 9, 2022, Edoc held an extraordinary general meeting pursuant to which Edoc’s shareholders approved extending the date by which Edoc had to complete a business combination from February 12, 2022 to August 12, 2022. In connection with the approval of the extension, shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 6,326,758 Ordinary Shares. As a result, an aggregate of $64,996,857.71 (or approximately $10.27 per share) was released from the Trust Account to pay such shareholders and 5,477,242 Ordinary Shares were issued and outstanding at February 11, 2022.



On August 12, 2022, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting pursuant to which the Company’s shareholders approved extending the date by which the Company had to complete a Business Combination from August 12, 2022 to February 12, 2023. In connection with the approval of the extension, shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 646,617 Class A ordinary shares. As a result, an aggregate of $6,660,150 (or approximately ($10.30 per share) was released from the Trust Account to pay such shareholders and 4,830,625 Ordinary Shares were issued and outstanding on August 13, 2022. In connection with such extension, the sponsor caused an aggregate of $202,460 to be deposited into the Company’s trust account and intends to pay an additional $303,944 (plus any applicable interest) into the trust account during the week of January 23, 2023.



Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination, such as the AOI Merger, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the trust account was approximately $10.52 per share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by certain advisory fees we will pay to I-Bankers. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite time period. However, if our initial shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period.





15







Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer.



We intend to hold a shareholder vote in connection with our business combination. In such case, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------




In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination.



If we seek shareholder approval, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, private shares and any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination.



In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote in conjunction with their initial business combination for business or other legal reasons (so long as shareholder approval is not required by the rules of Nasdaq), we will conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and our memorandum and articles of association. In such case, we will:




● | offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem shall remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act.





16







In connection with the successful consummation of our business combination, we may redeem pursuant to a tender offer up to that number of ordinary shares that would permit us to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. However, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares that are validly tendered plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not consummate the business combination, we will not purchase any shares pursuant to the tender offer and all shares will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer. Additionally, since we are required to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination (which may be substantially higher depending on the terms of our potential business combination), the chance that the holders of our ordinary shares electing to redeem in connection with a redemption conducted pursuant to the proxy rules will cause us to fall below such minimum requirement is increased.



When we conduct a tender offer to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the tender offer rules, the offer will be made to all of our shareholders, not just our public shareholders. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with any such tender offer.



Limitation on Redemption Rights upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval



If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, individually or together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to consummate our initial business combination, particularly in connection with our initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering) for or against our initial business combination. We will resolve any disputes relating to whether a public shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” either by requiring certifications under the penalty of perjury to such effect by public shareholders or via adjudication in court.



See “The AOI Merger” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals and the redemption rights related to the AOI Merger. 



Permitted Purchases of Our Securities by Our Affiliates



If we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our initial shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases.





17







The purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.



As a consequence of any such purchases, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange following consummation of a business combination.



Tendering Share Certificates in Connection With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights



We will require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the expiration date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder’s option. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.



The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on our initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery at or prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.



Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the general meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.





18







If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.



If our initial proposed business combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate our initial business combination with a different target until February 12, 2023.



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association currently provide that we will have only until February 12, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination by February 12, 2023 or are unable to obtain shareholder approval to further extend this deadline, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by February 12, 2023. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.



Our initial shareholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by February 12, 2023 (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame).



Our initial shareholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by February 12, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our initial shareholders, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.



We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $13,726 held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.





19







If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.52. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.17, plus interest (net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses). While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.



Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum and the representative for the underwriter will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.17 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.17 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against our sponsor, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our initial shareholders, officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.



In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.17 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.17 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.17 per public share.



We seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to the amounts held outside the trust account ($13,726 as of December 31, 2022) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder.





20







If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.52 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by February 12, 2023, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by February 12, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination by February 12, 2023, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as AOI, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups, venture capital funds leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, and our outstanding rights and warrants and the potential future dilution they represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.





21







Employees



We have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time our officers devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



We have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time frame.



We are required to have our internal control procedures evaluated for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.





22







We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following November 12, 2025, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.



We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
