Executive Summary of Our Business  
 TYME is an emerging biotechnology company developing cancer metabolism-based therapies (CMBTsTM) that are intended to be effective across a broad range of solid tumors and hematologic cancers, while also maintaining patients’ quality of life through relatively low toxicity profiles. Unlike targeted therapies that attempt to regulate specific pathways within cancer, TYME’s therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic requirements to cause cancer cell death. Our first-in-class CMBT compounds include SM-88 and TYME-18. These compounds are structurally and mechanistically different, and we believe they offer the potential for better and safer medicines. Early clinical results demonstrated by SM-88 in multiple advanced cancers, including pancreatic, prostate, sarcomas and breast, reinforce the potential of our emerging CMBT pipeline. Moreover, this pipeline offers hope to patients for a new future in long-term management of advanced cancers.

Our lead clinical CMBT compound, SM-88, is an oral investigational modified proprietary tyrosine derivative that is hypothesized to interrupt the metabolic processes of cancer cells by breaking down the cells’ key defenses and leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. To date, clinical trial data have shown that SM-88 has achieved confirmed tumor responses across 15 different cancers, both solid and liquid tumors, including pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, sarcoma and lymphoma cancers with minimal serious Grade 3 or higher adverse events, which we believe is rare for investigational compounds. Our lead compound SM-88 is now in a pivotal trial and an adaptive randomized Phase II/III clinical trial with registration intent for patients with second- and third-line pancreatic cancer. Patients are also being enrolled in a Phase II study evaluating SM-88 in high-risk sarcomas, and we presented final SM-88 Phase II clinical data at European Society for Medical Oncology’s ESMO 2019 conference showing encouraging clinical benefit in patients with bio-marker recurrent prostate cancer.

TYME-18 is a CMBT compound under development that is delivered intratumorally. Like SM-88, TYME-18 leverages the unique metabolism of cancer to create a treatment for inoperable tumors. Preliminary observations of the local administration of TYME-18, an amphiphilic steroid acid, suggested its potential as an important regulator of energy metabolism that may impede the ability of tumors to increase in size which could prove useful in difficult-to-treat cancers. In initial preclinical xenograft mouse studies, TYME-18 was able to completely resolve over 90 percent (11/12 mice) of established colorectal tumors within 12 days versus an average of over 600 percent growth in the control animals. We plan to continue with the development of TYME-18 in solid tumors and to provide details of an IND (Initial New Drug Application) enabling program this calendar year.
 
TYME has multiple cancer metabolism-based assets and other formulations for SM-88 in development, including injectable, intranasal, and transdermal, which are in pre-clinical stages. 
 
TYME has an expanding patent portfolio broadly covering compositions, methods, manufacturing and use of its pipeline to 2032, and beyond. To date, TYME has 194 issued patents and patent applications worldwide, including 10 issued patents and an additional 12 patent applications in the United States.Our Guiding Principles
 
TYME is committed to improving the lives of cancer patients worldwide through a workplace culture that empowers, engages, enriches and inspires employees who come to work every day to change the course of metastatic cancers through bold and creative pursuits in science, and a promise to put patients first. We are passionate about the people we serve - the patients. We are bold and courageous in our approach to turn the impossible into the possible. We hold trustworthiness in the highest regard. We aspire to always do better, and we work to exceed expectations through excellence in all we say and do.
SM-88 Mechanism of Action 
 
SM-88 (racemetyrosine) is an orally administered cancer metabolism-based therapy that is chemically altered to be non-functional for fundamental tumor cell processes, including protein synthesis. Scientific literature has broadly published that normal healthy cells do not regularly take up certain non-essential amino acids, specifically tyrosine, while a wide range of cancer cells upregulate methods to consume these metabolites. We believe that, when taken up by a cancer cell, our proprietary modified dysfunctional tyrosine interrupts protein synthesis, reduces key cellular defenses, and ultimately leads to an oxidative stress-related apoptosis or cell death. We also believe this selective cancer uptake of non-essential amino acids is supported by the current safety profile showing minimal observed drug-related serious adverse events (each, an “SAE”) in approximately 180 cancer patients treated with SM-88 to date, which includes patients of the Compassionate Use Program (discussed below) for whom we have safety results, but limited information regarding efficacy.
 
SM-88 is currently administered with the conditioning agents Methoxsalen, Phenytoin and Sirolimus (“MPS”). The conditioning agents are administered at doses between 5% and 25% of their U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved doses in non-cancer indications. We believe, based on scientific literature of their respective biologic functions, the physiologic, but sub-therapeutic doses of these agents may augment either the uptake of SM-88 or destabilize cancer cells.  
 
The Company has established pre-clinical research collaborations with academic institutions, as well as internal pre-clinical initiatives, to broaden the detailed understanding of the mechanisms associated with SM-88.  The overall goals of these efforts are to potentially identify patient or disease biomarkers that could be applied to patient selection in clinical trials, as well as identify potential combinations with other anti-cancer mechanisms that could aid future clinical development. We currently have a research collaboration with Mayo Clinic and NYU Langone Health and could establish additional collaborations in the future.

Development Strategy and Key Product Properties
 
Our goal is to develop CMBTs that may help patients live longer and better lives through next-generation medicines that are both better and safer treatments than current cancer treatment options. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

• | Successfully advance SM-88 across a broad range of cancers through clinical development, regulatory approvals and commercial launch globally.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to invest in our technology platform and expand the breadth and depth of our IP portfolio. We plan to expand our research and development (“R&D”) efforts to encompass multiple cancer indications in both solid tumors and hematologic cancers. We have undertaken early development programs for additional delivery systems of our lead oral candidate, SM-88, as well as new investigational CMBTs to treat cancer patients with high unmet medical needs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a balanced portfolio of proprietary and partnered programs. We plan to independently develop and commercialize multiple drug candidates for human indications within the oncology field. For targets outside our core areas of interest or where a partner can contribute specific expertise, we intend to evaluate potential collaborations with strategic partners and/or potential acquisitions of other companies and/or their assets that can augment our expertise and technology, as well as a means to acquire rights or ownership of additional intellectual property (“IP”). We also contemplate exploring global development partners and arrangements, where appropriate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By using SM-88 to disrupt key aspects of cancer’s unique metabolism, our intention is to create an innovative therapeutic approach that is:
 
 
• | Broadly effective across different cancer types – Because a vast majority of cancers use the same metabolic process, known as the Warburg Effect, we believe that they likely also have the same susceptibilities to SM-88 treatment, regardless of physiologic origin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly specific to cancer – As supported by the current safety data reported for approximately 180 patients, together with recent advances in radiographic imaging that use tyrosine-based agents to selectively image cancer cells, cancer appears to have a high affinity for tyrosine uptake compared to normal cells;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well-tolerated/ broad therapeutic margin – Safety findings are available for approximately 180 patients, and only two patients (1%) have reported any drug-related serious adverse events;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Suitable for monotherapy or combination therapy – Although most of TYME’s clinical and compassionate use experience has been in monotherapy, SM-88’s differentiated mechanism of action and safety profile may also allow it to be effective in combination with other cancer therapeutics; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potentially effective treatment for patients who have failed other therapeutic options – Current cancer therapies are often intended to inhibit or change a particular aspect of cancer’s cellular function, known as selective pressure. However, cancers typically develop resistance mechanisms that can make them less responsive to subsequent selective pressure treatments, while at the same time patients also accumulate treatment-related toxicities that can make them ineligible for subsequent therapies. SM-88 is designed to avoid selective pressure and this fundamental limitation of traditional therapies by utilizing cancer’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. We believe this novel mechanism of action may allow SM-88 to be used in traditional treatment-resistant patients and also limit development of resistance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe we can become a leader in developing and delivering CMBTs with our platform technology for the following reasons:
 
 
• | Members of our management team have extensive experience with scientific research and clinical development in the field of cancer metabolism-based therapies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7


 
• | Oral SM-88 has demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit and well tolerated safety profile, in metastatic cancer patients across 15 different types of solid tumors and hematologic cancers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | To date, SM-88 has shown a favorable safety profile and we believe the unique mechanism of action increases prospects for evaluation of the potential of SM-88 as a preferred therapy in combination with existing treatment modalities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We currently retain all commercial rights for SM-88 and new pipeline candidates through a strong and growing patent estate of over 65 issued patents and 129 pending patent applications in various countries broadly covering compositions, methods, manufacturing and use in connection with the treatment of cancers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a technology base and patent portfolio supporting SM-88 and have filed patents applications for additional drug candidates to provide a pipeline of oncology drug development programs based on our CMBT technology platform.

SM-88: Completed Studies  
 
First in Human Study
 
The initial clinical trial with SM-88, known as the First in Human Study (“FHS”), began in 2012 and was conducted in 30 actively progressing metastatic cancer patients who had failed or refused all available treatments options. The Phase I study was designed to assess the safety of monotherapy SM-88, although the trial was extended beyond the initial six-week period based on reported treatment efficacy, with several patients remaining on treatment for over 12 months. Patients were given SM-88 with conditioning agents melanin, melanotan II, phenytoin, and sirolimus (these conditioning agents will hereafter be referred to as “M2PS”).
 
The results of the FHS were published in the journal, Investigational New Drugs, in March 2019, including data from the trial’s initiation in January 2012 through September 2017. Patients were treated with monotherapy SM-88 and achieved median overall survival (“OS”) of 29.8 months, median progression free survival (“PFS”) of 13 months, and a 33% objective response rate (“ORR”). The ORR consisted of four complete responses (“CR”) and six partial responses (“PR”), based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (“RECIST”).  In addition, 57% of patients (17/30) achieved RECIST stable disease (“SD”) with a median SD duration of 11 months. Five FHS patients with metastatic cancer survived for over five years after commencing SM-88 treatment. All FHS patients improved or maintained Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (“ECOG PS”), a measure of quality of life, after initiating SM-88 therapy, and OS was comparable for patients who entered the trial with ECOG PS ranging from 0 (asymptomatic) to 2 (unable to perform any work-related activities).
 
We also reported multiple subgroup analyses of FHS patients. As of September 2017, 67% of FHS patients were reported to have had no additional systemic therapies since their initial enrollment in FHS in 2012, including all five of the surviving FHS patients. Patients without any further treatment beyond SM-88 showed greater mean and median OS (37 and 38 months, respectively) than patients who received subsequent treatments beyond SM-88 (30 and 28 months, respectively). Regarding therapies prior to SM-88, patients with two or more prior systemic therapies experienced a median OS of 23 months, including two CRs and three PRs, after beginning SM-88 therapy. For the three most common cancer types in the FHS, we reported median and mean OS for the following patients by cancer type: breast cancer, 35 and 36 months (n=14); lung cancer, 25 and 30 months (n=5); and pancreatic cancer, 24 and 24 months (n=3). In the breast cancer subgroup, median OS of 35 months was achieved despite patients having an average of 2.5 prior lines of systemic drug therapy and 4.5 prior therapeutic lines, including systemic, surgical or radiation therapy. 43% of patients in the breast cancer subgroup achieved CR or PR while on SM-88 monotherapy and ECOG PS average baseline improved from 1.8 to 0.6 after six weeks of SM-88 therapy. Additionally, after having stopped SM-88 treatment in the FHS, three breast cancer patients received additional treatment with SM-88 at a later time and all three of such patients were alive as of the last reported data in October 2017. One of the re-treated patients experienced a second objective tumor response from SM-88 monotherapy as measured by RECIST criteria.
 
We believe that traditional RECIST response criteria, a commonly used clinical endpoint based primarily on computerized tomography (“CT”) images, may not fully reflect the therapeutic benefit from SM-88. This is based on the observation in the First in Human Study where a total of 17 of the 30 patients achieved SD with median OS of 29.0 months. Because we believe many patients on SM-88 experience therapeutic benefit without necessarily 
 8


achieving a CR or PR under RECIST criteria, we commonly refer to “Clinical Benefit,” which includes CR, PR and SD designations.
 
SM-88 used with M2PS demonstrated a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated. All related adverse events (AEs) for SM-88 were classified as mild or moderate. The most common treatment AEs experienced included hyperpigmentation by 100% of patients (30/30), fatigue by 56.7% of patients (17/30) and pain by 10% of patients (3/30). No dose limiting toxicities were observed. 
 
Compassionate Use Program
 
In parallel with and following the First in Human Study, we also allowed advanced cancer patients’ access to SM-88 through a compassionate use program under Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) supervision (the “Compassionate Use Patients”). In early 2018, we performed a retrospective analysis on 53 Compassionate Use Patients who had available data and received at least six weeks of treatment. These patients had their scans reviewed by independent radiologists to determine response under RECIST, and 75% of these patients (40 of 53) were deemed to have experienced Clinical Benefit, consisting of 8 CRs, 16 PRs and 16 SD designations.
 
Through these two programs, patients being treated with SM-88 have achieved confirmed responses across 15 different cancer types, including some of the most common and difficult to treat cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, breast, lung, glioma, ovarian, sarcoma and colon cancer. Based on preliminary data from the FHS and the Compassionate Use Patients suggesting SM-88 may have broad potential applicability and acceptable toxicity, we believe that SM-88 may ultimately be utilized as a treatment for a wide range of cancers prior to the end-stage setting.
 
SM-88 Ongoing Studies
 
Pancreatic Cancer Trial (“TYME-88-Panc”)
 
TYME-88-Panc was initially designed as a two-part, open-label clinical trial evaluating SM-88 as an oral monotherapy in late-stage patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Part 1 was designed to determine optimal dose for pivotal testing and patients were given either a high or low dose of SM-88. Preliminary data from Part 1 was released at the ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer on July 4, 2019. Based on the encouraging efficacy data and the well tolerated safety profiles, the TYME-88-Panc protocol was amended in 2019 and is now intended as a pivotal registration trial. The amended protocol is a 1:1 randomized study of SM-88 versus an investigator’s choice of three pre-determined single agent therapies.
 
Part 1 of TYME-88-Panc included 49 heavily pretreated patients with radiographically progressive metastatic pancreatic cancer, who had received a median of two prior systemic therapies and had significant disease related morbidity before receiving SM-88 used with MPS. Of the 49 patients, 38 patients were evaluable for efficacy, as defined in the protocol. Preliminary results from Part 1 of TYME-88-Panc, using information available as of April 25, 2019, demonstrated 6.4 months median OS of evaluable patients (n=38). The reported survival of patients progressing after second line therapy was 3 months, based on an analysis of 19 published trials with patients who had progressed after second line treatment (Manax, et al J Clin Oncol 37, 2019 (suppl 4; abstr 226)). In addition, there is an approximate 2 to 4-week transition between second and third line treatments. Thus, based on these considerations, the expected survival for this patient population at the start of treatment would be 2 to 2.5 months.
 
As a result of the encouraging results demonstrated in Part 1 of the TYME-88-Panc study of SM-88, TYME has launched Part 2 of TYME-88-Panc study designed as a multi-center randomized (1:1), controlled pivotal trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of SM-88 used with MPS in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas whose disease has progressed or recurred and have received two lines of prior systemic therapy. Approximately 250 patients will be randomized to receive 920 mg of SM-88 with MPS (Arm A n=125) or one of three pre-defined single agent therapies (Arm B n=125). Patients will be treated until there is unacceptable toxicity or disease progression or if any treatment discontinuation criteria are met. The primary endpoint is OS. Key exploratory endpoints include PFS, clinical benefit response rate (“CBR”), defined as patients achieving SD or better, circulating tumor cells (“CTCs”) and quality of life. The study will include leading pancreatic cancer research sites across the United States.

Based on information available on April 25, 2019, certain efficacy indicators correlated with greater OS, including the achievement of SD or better under RECIST and decreases in CTCs. Clinical benefit rates of SD or better under RECIST were achieved by 44% (11/25) of patients with available imaging as of April 25, 2019. Notably, patients achieving SD or better demonstrated a statistically significant (p=0.02) improvement in survival with a 92% reduction in risk of death (hazard ratio=0.08 (95% CI 0.01 – 0.63)). 
The CBR was durable, with a majority of these patients remaining in SD or better at more than seven months after receiving treatment with SM-88.
 
In TYME-88-Panc, based on information available as of April 25, 2019, a median reduction of 63% in CTC burden was observed in evaluable patients. Importantly, patients (10 of 24) with available results reaching an 80% reduction or greater in CTCs demonstrated a 60% decrease in risk of death (p=0.18, hazard ratio: 0.4 (95%CI (0.11 – 1.5)).
 
As of April 25, 2019, the study reported that SM-88 was well tolerated with only 4.0% of patients (2 of 49) who experienced serious adverse events (“SAEs”) deemed at least possibly related to SM-88 (abdominal pain, arthralgia, and hypotension). One patient with reported SAEs continued on treatment.  

The amended pivotal protocol for TYME-88-Panc (“Part 2”) is enrolling and, in early January 2020 the Company announced the first patient was dosed.

 PanCAN Precision PromiseSM Adaptive Phase II/III Trial Platform
 
We have entered into an agreement for SM-88 to be included in an experimental arm in the novel Precision Promise adaptive randomized Phase II/III trial platform with registration intent sponsored by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (“PanCAN”). The objective of Precision Promise is to expedite the study and approval of promising therapies for pancreatic cancer by bringing multiple stakeholders together, including academic, industry and regulatory entities.
 
The primary goal of SM-88’s inclusion is to study SM-88 as a monotherapy treatment arm for patients who have failed one prior line of chemotherapy. Additionally, it is planned that SM-88 will be evaluated in combination with gemcitabine (Gemzar ®) and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane ®) for first-line patients. The second-line monotherapy arm initiated in January 2020.
 
PanCAN is sponsoring Precision Promise and providing funding and other support. While TYME’s SM-88 is included in the trial, we will not oversee, conduct or control the trial.
 
Phase II Prostate Cancer Trial
 
We presented final data from our Phase II trial of SM-88 in patients with non-metastatic, biochemical-recurrent prostate cancer at the ESMO Congress 2019 on September 30, 2019. Twenty-three (23) patients were enrolled in the trial and entered with rising prostate-specific antigen levels, detectable CTCs and no radiographically detectable metastases. The study duration was six months, per the study protocol, although some patients were granted a waiver to remain on treatment for longer periods. Seventy-four percent (74%) of patients (17/23) had previously received androgen deprivation therapy as treatment for prostate cancer. All enrolled patients were given daily oral SM-88 with MPS for the duration of treatment.
 
Based on data as of September 2019, 100% of patients (23/23) on trial remained free of metastatic progression and 87% of patients (20/23) maintained radiographic progression-free survival (“rPFS”) with a median duration of 6.5 months from the initial diagnoses of prostate specific antigen (“PSA”) rise. All patients who maintained rPFS also exhibited meaningful reductions in CTCs.
 
All patients with available CTC results for at least 3 cycles (n=19) achieved a decrease from baseline, with a median decrease of 65.3% at the end of 3 cycles. The median baseline PSA for patients with radiographic progression was 13.4 compared to 5.6 for patients with no radiographic progression (p=0.02). 13% of patients experienced a PSA progression after commencing therapy and 52% of patients (12/23) experienced an improvement in median PSA doubling time, a positive prognostic indicator.  
 
Patients without local progression (20/23) had slightly higher testosterone levels at baseline and throughout treatment on SM-88 as compared to those who experienced local radiographic progression (3/23), based on data as of September 2019. According to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
 10


Questionnaire, patients generally reported stable cognitive and sexual function domain measures, with no detectable worsening in any domain. Patient weight, EKG QT interval, glucose and hematocrit and other measures, which are often side effects of androgen deprivation therapy, did not appear affected while receiving SM-88.
 
The SM-88 therapy was well tolerated in all patients in the trial. There were no treatment-related SAEs. No adverse events resulted in dose delay, discontinuation, or reduction. The majority of Grade 1 adverse events deemed possibly or probably related to the SM-88 investigational therapy were gastrointestinal in nature.
 
Enrollment in our Phase II prostate cancer trial has been completed and final results are expected to be published in the second half of calendar year 2020.
 
Investigator-Initiated Phase II Sarcoma Trial
 
The HopES trial, an investigator-initiated prospective open-label Phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of SM-88 with MPS for the treatment of poor prognosis sarcomas, began dosing patients in January 2020. Up to 24 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the HopES trial through two patient cohorts. The first cohort will evaluate oral SM-88 as maintenance monotherapy following primary or palliative treatments for Ewing's sarcoma patients with a high risk of relapse or disease progression. The second cohort will determine the clinical benefits of SM-88 as salvage monotherapy for patients with clinically advanced sarcomas. The primary objectives are to measure ORR and PFS. Secondary objectives include duration of response, OS, CBR using RECIST v1.1, and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events.  The Joseph Ahmed Foundation is providing funding and patient support for this trial and the trial is being conducted by principal investigator Dr. Chawla at the Sarcoma Oncology Center in Santa Monica, CA. 
 
Upcoming Studies and Developments
 
TYME-18 Preclinical Studies
 
TYME-18 is a cancer metabolism-based investigational therapy designed for the intra-tumoral delivery of the treatment and increase the permeability of cancer cells while delivering a therapy that will have a selective cytotoxic effect on the tumor. TYME-18 is distinct in composition from SM-88. However, like SM-88, it aims to enhance the susceptibility of a cancer to the highly acidic and toxic tumor microenvironment, while minimizing the impact to normal tissues. 
 
In initial preclinical xenograft mouse studies, TYME-18 was able to completely resolve over 90 percent (11/12 mice) of established colorectal tumors within 12 days versus an average of over 600 percent growth in the control animals. Additionally, there was no detected necrosis of the normal tissue surrounding the tumor site or other identified toxicities in the animals treated with TYME-18. A subsequent study repeated the same efficacy results, with 11 of 12 TYME-18 treated mice showing complete resolution of targeted lesions. We plan to continue with the development of TYME-18 in solid tumors and to provide details of an IND-enabling program this calendar year.
 
Animal Health
 
Our co-founder, Steve Hoffman, holds substantially all intellectual property rights with respect to the treatment of cancer in non-humans. Following interest from third parties in creating health partnerships, a committee of independent members of our board of directors (the “Board”) has held discussions with our co-founders to obtain intellectual property rights such that the Company could have the ability to pursue cancer therapies in animal health.
Competition
 Our business strategy is intended to effectively position SM-88 for competition with products manufactured by other companies in the highly fragmented and competitive cancer treatment market. Our competition comes from other commercial and research enterprises working in the field of cancer research. This includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, patient advocacy groups and hospitals and government private research institutes around the globe.
 The TYME-88-Panc study was amended to study SM-88 in third-line pancreatic patients.  There are no FDA approved third-line pancreatic treatments and there are no active therapies recommended in the ASCO or National 
 11


Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.  If commercialized for third-line pancreatic treatment, the competition for SM-88 would be physician choice of therapy, supportive care and/or clinical trials.
 Important competitive factors include patient safety, effectiveness, quality-of-life and ease of use of products; price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; payor access and research and development of new products and processes. Most new products we intend to market, assuming regulatory approval, will and must compete with other products already on the market as well as products that are later developed by existing or new competitors. If competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products would be subject to progressive price reductions, decreased volume of sales or both. Increasingly, to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers, managed care organizations and pharmacy benefits managers, we would be required to demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also more value as compared with other treatment regimens.
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development and regulatory plans in addition to proprietary scientific knowledge provide us with certain competitive advantages, we currently have limited financial resources and no revenue source and face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, each of which has significantly greater financial resources than us. Any drugs that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new potential therapies that may become available in the future.
 Our products, if approved for sale, would eventually be subject to competition from generic drug manufacturers. Manufacturers of generic biopharmaceuticals generally invest far less in R&D and marketing than R&D companies such as us. We anticipate that any manufacturer of a generic version of our drugs will invest far less than we have in the past and intend to do in the future. They therefore, have the advantage in that they can price their drugs much lower than the brand-name drugs for which we obtain approval. Additionally, in many countries outside the United States, IP protection is weak or nonexistent and we would be forced to compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products in such countries whether or not we hold legal exclusivity.
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy. Our products once approved, would compete not only with other drugs, but also with such other types of therapies and treatments.
 There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer with currently marketed therapies providing benefits to many patients, these therapies often are limited to some extent by a lack of efficacy and/or the significance or frequency of AEs.
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant, additional competition for SM-88.
 Intellectual Property
 We will strive to protect and enhance our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including through seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights (when required), whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also intend to rely on trade secrets related to our proprietary technology platform and our know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of cancer treatment, which may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions, where available. 
 12


Our commercial success may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both our owned and licensed IP, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing such products, as well as being held valid if challenged.
 Tyme maintains a broad intellectual property portfolio of 194 patent applications granted and/or pending worldwide. The patents encompass SM-88 as well as inventions that fight cancer and aid in the creation of novel mechanisms to further that effort. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We have and will continue to seek U.S. and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: pharmaceutical compositions, methods for treating diseases of interest, methods for manufacturing the pharmaceutical compositions and research tools and methods. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel products. We will also seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
 We believe we have no need to license any technologies for SM-88 to be commercially viable. We believe our Company owns all the IP necessary for SM-88 to perform as intended and to be commercially marketed, once all applicable regulatory requirements have been obtained. Additionally, we believe the drug substances utilized in SM-88 are not covered by any patents that would impede our use of such drug substances.
 We also rely on trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights. Our trademark portfolio currently consists of one domestic trademark: CMBTs (cancer metabolism-based therapies).
 FDA Approval Process
 SM-88 is subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA as a drug product. The FDA subjects drug products to extensive pre- and post-market regulation. The Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and the import and export of drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”), withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or fines or civil or criminal penalties.
 The drug development process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. is long, expensive and inherently uncertain. Drug development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal testing, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conducting of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices (“GLP”). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 13


An IND must become effective before U.S. clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND submission within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or subjects with the condition under investigation, all under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practices (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the ongoing IND file.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to clinical trial subjects. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must be submitted to an IRB for review and approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at a clinical site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions to assure subject safety. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and is tested to assess pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, AEs associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products targeted for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, initial human testing may be conducted in the intended patient population. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, as well as identification of common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II, Phase III trials are initiated to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase III clinical trials are intended to establish data sufficient to demonstrate substantial evidence of the efficacy and safety of the product to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. Trials conducted outside of the U.S. under similar, GCP-compliant conditions in accordance with local applicable laws may also be acceptable to the FDA in support of product licensing.
 Sponsors of clinical trials for investigational drugs must publicly disclose certain clinical trial information, including detailed trial design and trial results, in FDA public databases. These requirements are subject to specific timelines and apply to most controlled clinical trials of FDA-regulated products.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA review and approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology and CMC and must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product based on these results. The NDA must also contain extensive manufacturing information. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial and is in addition to the costs of conducting clinical trials. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, as well as annual product and establishment user fees, which may total several million dollars and are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the NDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drugs are reviewed within 10 months from the date the application is accepted for filing. Although the FDA often meets its user fee performance goals, it can extend these timelines if necessary and its review may not occur on a timely basis at all. The FDA usually refers applications for novel drugs, which present complex questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee - typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts - for review, evaluation and a 
 14


recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug product unless it verifies that compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) standards is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication(s) being studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional nonclinical or clinical testing or supplemental information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If or when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information that was included. The FDA approval is never guaranteed, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval for a drug may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA may also require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, as a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to further ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS or use of a companion diagnostic with a drug can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require, as a condition of approval, substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 As of March 31, 2020, we have two active INDs with the FDA, both of which are associated with SM-88. The two INDs are active with the relevant FDA departments that oversee our two ongoing clinical trials, the Department of Oncology Products 1 (“DOP1”) for our prostate cancer trial, and the Department of Oncology Products 2 (“DOP2”) for our pancreatic cancer trial.  In addition, clinical investigators have previously and may in the future request their own INDs in order to use SM-88 or other products in Investigator Initiated Trials (“IITs”).  For example, the HopES trial for sarcoma is an IIT where the IND for SM-88 use is held directly by the clinical trial site. 
 In February 2019 and July 2019, we participated in Type C meetings with the FDA. During those meetings we received guidance on our pivotal trial for SM-88 in third line pancreatic cancer.  The trial is a randomized study comparing SM-88 to the control arm. The control arm consists of physician’s choice of therapies. The primary end point is overall survival. 
 Priority Review/Standard Review (U.S.) and Related Requirements
 The FDA may grant an NDA a priority review designation based both upon the request of an applicant and the results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in the NDA. This designation sets the target date at six months for FDA action on the application. Priority review is granted where preliminary trial results indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy for a situation where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or where the product is possibly a significant improvement over existing marketed products. If these criteria are not met for priority review, the NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months. However, priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for regulatory approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. There can be no assurance that we would be able to satisfy the eligibility criteria for priority review or to receive regulatory approval under either standard review.
 15


Breakthrough Therapy Approvals
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act provides another designation for an expedited FDA review process called Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A breakthrough therapy is a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If an investigational drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the drug will be eligible for all fast track designation features, including expedited development and review of such drug for trial and market approval. All requests for Breakthrough Therapy Designation are to be reviewed within 60 days of receipt and FDA will either grant or deny the request.
Fast Track Program
 The fast track program, a provision of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (“FDAMA”), is designed to facilitate interactions between a sponsor and the FDA before and during submission of an NDA for an investigational agent that, alone or in combination with one or more drugs, that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for that disease or condition. Under the fast track program, the FDA may consider reviewing portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, if the FDA determines, after a preliminary evaluation of the clinical data, that a fast track drug may be effective. A fast track designation provides the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA and could make the drug eligible for and accelerated approval priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of submission of the NDA.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits having an effective approval date for an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for another version of such drug during the five-year exclusive period; however, submission of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA containing a paragraph IV certification is permitted after four years, which may trigger a 30-month stay of approval of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the submission or approval of another “full” NDA; however, the applicant for the “full” NDA would be required to conduct its own preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, for, among other things, new indications, dosages or strengths of a currently approved drug, if new clinical investigations conducted or sponsored by the applicant are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the new or supplemental NDA.
 In addition to non-patent marketing exclusivity, the Hatch-Waxman Act amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to require each NDA sponsor to submit with its application information on any patent that claims the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product (formulation and composition) and method-of-use for which the applicant submitted the NDA and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use or sale of the drug. Generic applicants that wish to rely on the approval of a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to each listed patent. The Orange Book is a listing of all drug products that have been approved by the FDA and their generic equivalences. We intend to submit for Orange Book listing all relevant patents for SM-88 and to vigorously defend any Orange Book-listed patents for our approved products.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act also permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, a patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years after the FDA approves a marketing application. The patent term extension period is generally equal to the sum of one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA and all the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, up to a total of five years. Only one patent applicable to a regulatory review period that 
 16


represents the first commercial marketing of that drug is eligible for the extension and it must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term extension. We will consider applying for a patent term extension for some of our patents, to add patent life beyond the expiration date, depending on our ability to meet certain legal requirements permitting such extension and the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of an NDA. There can be no assurance that such an extension, if applied for, will be granted.
 Advertising and Promotion
 The FDA prohibits the pre-approved marketing and promotion of drugs and closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including through standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials are pre-cleared by the FDA and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
 Drugs may be marketed only after initial approval and only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes to indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing original and resubmitted NDAs.
 AE Reporting and cGMP Compliance
 AE reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain manufacturing subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects’ entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if the product encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Orphan Drug
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition; generally, a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a product to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for the product for treatment of the specified indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. When appropriate, we intend to hold discussions with the FDA regarding pursuing orphan drug designation for SM-88. There can be no assurance given that such discussions, if commenced, would result in our pursuing orphan drug designation for SM-88 or that, if pursued, the FDA would grant SM-88 an orphan drug designation.
 17


Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice and state and local governments.
United States Adopted Names (USAN) Council
 
In the first calendar quarter of 2019, we were notified that United States Adopted Names (USAN) Council has approved the use of the nonproprietary generic name, racemetyrosine, for SM-88.  
European Regulation and Review
 EU Approval Process
 The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) is a decentralized scientific agency of the European Union (“EU”). It coordinates the evaluation and monitoring of centrally authorized medicinal products. It is responsible for the scientific evaluation of applications for EU marketing authorizations, as well as the development of technical guidance and the provision of scientific advice to sponsors. The EMA decentralizes its scientific assessment of medicines by working through a network of about 4,500 experts throughout the EU, nominated by the Member States. The EMA draws on resources of over 40 National Competent Authorities of European Member States.
 The process regarding regulatory approval of medicinal products in the EU is similar to the U.S. and likewise generally involves satisfactorily completing each of the following:
  
• | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the applicable European GLP regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the relevant national authorities of a clinical trial application (“CTA”) for each trial in humans, which must be approved before the trial may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the relevant competent authorities of a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”), which includes the data supporting safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labeling;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an inspection by the relevant national authorities of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product is produced to assess compliance with strictly enforced cGMPs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential audits of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the MAA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review and approval by the relevant competent authority of the MAA before any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with the relevant European regulations and requirements. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animal studies in order to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of the preclinical tests, together with relevant manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of the CTA.
Clinical Trial Approval
 Pursuant to the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the Member States. Under this system, approval must be 
 18


obtained from the competent national authority of each European Member State in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier (“IMPD”) and further supporting information prescribed by the Clinical Trials Directive and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country.
 An EU regulation on clinical trials was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in 2014. The new regulation aims to simplify consent rules, streamline application procedures by creating a centralized process for approval, provide more transparency and harmonize performance of clinical trials throughout the EU Member States. The new regulations are anticipated to take effect in 2020, with one-year transition period during which a new CTA can be authorized either according to the old Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC or the new 536/2014 Regulation, as requested by the sponsor.
 Manufacturing and import into the EU of investigational medicinal products is subject to the holding of appropriate authorizations and must be carried out in accordance with cGMPs.
 Health Authority Interactions
 During the development of a medicinal product, frequent interactions with the EU regulators are vital to make sure all relevant input and guidelines/regulations are taken into account in the overall program.
Pediatric Studies
 Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, which came into force in the EU on January 26, 2007, aims to facilitate the development and accessibility of medical products for use in children without subjecting children to unnecessary trials or delaying the authorization of medicinal products for use in adults. The regulation established the Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”), which is responsible for coordinating the EMA’s activities regarding medicines for children. The PDCO’s main role is to determine which studies that marketing authorization applicants need to complete in the pediatric population as part of the so-called Pediatric Investigation Plans (“PIP”). All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines that were not authorized in the EU before January 26, 2007 have to include either the results of studies carried out in children of different ages (as agreed with the PDCO) or proof that a waiver or a deferral of these studies has been obtained from the PDCO. As indicated, the PDCO determines what pediatric studies are necessary and describes them in a PIP. This requirement for pediatric studies also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PDCO can grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults and can also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population.
 Before an MAA can be filed or an existing marketing authorization can be varied, the EMA checks that companies are in compliance with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
 Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 also introduced several incentives for the development of medicines for children in the EU:
  
• | medicines that have been authorized across the EU in compliance with an agreed PIP are eligible for an extension of their patent protection by six months (this is the case even when the pediatric studies’ results are negative);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for orphan medicines, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity, extending the typical 10-year period to 12 years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of medicines for children; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate, may be eligible for a pediatric use marketing authorization (“PUMA”); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


 
• | if a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from 10 years of market protection as an incentive for the development of the product for use in children.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAA
 Authorization to market a product in the EU member states proceeds under one of three procedures: (i) a centralized authorization procedure, (ii) a mutual recognition procedure, (iii) a decentralized national procedure.
Centralized Authorization Procedure
 Certain drugs, including medicinal products developed by means of biotechnological processes, must be approved via the centralized authorization procedure for marketing authorization. A successful application under the centralized authorization procedure results in a marketing authorization from the European Commission, which is automatically valid in all EU member states. The other European Economic Area member states (namely Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) are also obligated to recognize the Commission decision. The EMA and the European Commission administer the centralized authorization procedure.
 Under the centralized authorization procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of human products on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state’s national drug authority, with one of them appointed to act as Rapporteur for the coordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the Committee acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP is required to issue an opinion within 210 days of receipt of a valid application, though the clock is stopped if it is necessary to ask the applicant for clarification or further supporting data. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report is produced. If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product are sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. The CHMP’s opinion is sent to the European Commission, which uses the opinion as the basis for its decision whether or not to grant a marketing authorization. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached. After a drug has been authorized and launched, it is a condition of maintaining the marketing authorization that all aspects relating to its quality, safety and efficacy must be kept under review. Sanctions may be imposed for failure to adhere to the conditions of the marketing authorization. In extreme cases, the authorization may be revoked, resulting in withdrawal of the product from sale.
 Mutual Recognition Procedure and Decentralized National Procedure
 Under a Mutual Recognition Procedure (“MRP”) or a Decentralized Procedure (“DCP”), the applicant must select which and how many EU member states in which to seek approval. In the case of an MRP, the applicant must initially receive national approval in one EU member state. This will be the so-called reference member state (“RMS”) for the MRP. Then, the applicant seeks approval for the product in other EU member states, the so-called concerned member states (“CMS”) in a second step.
 For the DCP, the applicant will approach all chosen Member States at the same time. To do so, the applicant will identify the RMS that will assess the submitted MAA and provide the other selected Member States with the conclusions and results of the assessment. In principle, the applicant can choose any EU Member State as the RMS; however, in almost all Member States, the applicant needs to send a request for a time slot when the applicant will be allowed to submit the application. Depending on the Member State selected as RMS, the interval between submission of the request to the actual submission date can be two years or longer.
 Accelerated Assessment Procedure
 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days, which excludes clock stops when additional written or oral information needs to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, such as when a medicinal product is expected to be a major public health interest, as defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated (e.g. heavily disabling or life-threatening); the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and an anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. Under these circumstances, the European Medicines Agency ensures that the opinion of 
 20


the CHMP is delivered within 150 days, excluding clock stops. There can be no assurance however, that we would be able to satisfy any of these requirements or receive any approval or accelerated evaluation.
 Conditional Approval
 Under EU regulations, a medicine that would fulfill an unmet medical need may, if its immediate availability is in the interest of public health, be granted a conditional marketing authorization on the basis of less complete clinical data than are normally required, subject to specific obligations being imposed on the authorization holder. These specific obligations are to be reviewed annually by the EMA. The list of these obligations is to be made publicly accessible. Such an authorization is valid for one year, on a renewable basis.
 Period of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization is initially valid for five years and may then be renewed on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder is to provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variants introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least nine months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization that is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the European market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called “sunset” clause).
 Orphan Drug Designation
 EU regulations also provide for an orphan drug designation. This designation is granted if its sponsor can establish:
  
(a) | (i) that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made; or
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (ii) that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and
  
(b) | that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time before the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. However, this period may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify continued market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinically relevant superiority” by a similar medicinal product or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a Member State in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for incentives made available by the EU and by its Member States to support research into and the development and availability of orphan drugs. It is not our current intention to pursue orphan drug designation for SM-88.
 Regulatory Data Protection
 Without prejudice to the law on the protection of industrial and commercial property, marketing authorizations for new medicinal products in the EU benefit from an 8+2+1 year period of regulatory protection.
 This regime consists of a regulatory data protection period of eight years plus a concurrent market exclusivity of ten years plus an additional market exclusivity of one additional year if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing approval holder obtains an approval for one or more new therapeutic indications that, during the 
 21


scientific evaluation prior to their approval, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Under the current rules, a third party may reference the preclinical and clinical data of the reference product beginning eight years after first approval, but the third party may market a generic version only after ten (or eleven) years have lapsed. Additional regulatory data protection can be applied for when an applicant has complied with all requirements as set forth in an approved PIP.
 International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)
 The International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”) is a project that brings together the regulatory authorities of Europe, Japan and the U.S. and experts from the pharmaceutical industry in the three regions to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceutical product registration. The purpose of ICH is to reduce or obviate the need to duplicate the testing carried out during the research and development of new medicines by recommending ways to achieve greater harmonization in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for product registration. Harmonization would lead to a more economical use of human, animal and material resources, the elimination of unnecessary delay in the global development and availability of new medicines, while maintaining safeguards on quality, safety, efficacy and regulatory obligations to protect public health.
 ICH guidelines have been adopted as law in many countries, but are only used as guidance in the U.S. by the FDA. In many areas of drug regulation, ICH has resulted in comparable requirements, for instance with respect to the Common Technical Document, which has become the core document for filings for market authorization in several jurisdictions. In this manner, ICH has facilitated a more efficient path to markets.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 As previously noted, in the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The division of competences within the EU leaves to its Member States the power to organize their own social security systems, including health care policies to promote the financial stability of their health care insurance systems.
 In this context, each of the Member States’ national authorities is free to set the prices of medicinal products and to designate the treatments that they wish to reimburse under their social security system. However, the EU has defined a common procedural framework through the adoption what is generally known as the “Transparency Directive.” This directive aims to ensure that national pricing and reimbursement decisions are made in a transparent manner and do not disrupt the operation of the internal market.
 The pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement systems established by Member States are usually quite complex. Each country uses different schemes and policies, adapted to its own economic and health needs. We would have to develop or access special expertise in this field to prepare health economic dossiers on our medicinal products if we would market our products, if and when approved, in the EU.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no near-term plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on and expect to continue to rely on, third party contract manufacturers for supplies of SM-88 for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for the initial commercial manufacture of any products that we may market following regulatory approval.
 We currently purchase all our drug substance and drug products from contract manufacturers and intend to continue to do so on an as-needed purchase order basis. We have entered into limited term supply arrangements for certain SM-88 components related to supply for our clinical activities in order to secure favorable pricing terms. We intend to identify and qualify any further necessary contract manufacturers to provide all active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) and finished drug product services during the IND stages and before submission of an NDA to the FDA.

Our current intention is that, during the ongoing development of SM-88, we will transition the needed manufacturing, CMC and GMP programs towards commercial manufacturing. The overall manufacturing program includes, but is not limited to, the development of product and process specifications, producing and validating standards and the development of suitable analytical methods for test and release, as well as stability testing. Before and during the use of contract manufacturers, we (or qualified designee) will conduct audits to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations. Our manufacturers themselves must comply with their in-house quality assurance programs and be available for inspections by regulatory agencies, including the FDA and European drug regulatory agencies. During the development of our drug candidates, we anticipate scaling the manufacturing process to a suitable size. Increasing scale involves several steps and may involve modification of the process, in which case modifications to our CMC sections will occur, with continuous submissions to the FDA and EU regulatory authorities.
 As we progress through the regulatory approval process, there is a possibility that our intended manufacturing process will undergo modifications, primarily based on initial manufacturing results and data generated during the manufacture of drug substance and product to be used in our clinical trials. Modifications could cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval of SM-88, if at all, as well increase our research and development and manufacturing costs and potentially make such product costs prohibitive to our intended end users and their medical insurance providers.
 SM-88 is currently administered with the conditioning agents methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus (“MPS”). Methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus each previously received regulatory approval in areas other than cancer treatment. SM-88 and the three agents within MPS are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale-up and we do not believe unusual equipment could be required in the manufacturing process.
 Our tyrosine-based component is a derivative product that has been modified by a proprietary process to modify its functionality. This drug substance is being manufactured on an exclusive basis by a leading, FDA-audited contract manufacturer that has previously manufactured tyrosine-based products on a commercial scale. This manufacturer currently is our sole supplier of this drug substance. To our knowledge, the current manufacturer of this drug substance is the only FDA-approved supplier of this drug. We believe this cGMP contract manufacturer has sufficient capacity to meet our projected needs into the near future and we maintain inventory on hand to meet our immediate clinical needs. In the event of a catastrophic event or if this contract manufacturer is unable to meet our needs, we will need to find an alternative source. This will likely result in delays for the clinical development program. It is not impossible to find a substitute for this supplier in the event that it becomes necessary, but it may be costly, including in terms of development time. We do not currently have arrangements in place for a redundant supply of the drug substance.
 To date, we have, through an FDA-audited contract manufacturer, produced cGMP drug substance for use in our planned clinical trials. In addition, we have produced cGMP clinical trial materials utilizing such drug substance, through an FDA-audited contract manufacturer. Such newly produced drug substance and clinical trial materials are currently undergoing long term regulatory testing. We believe we have produced enough drug substance to create an inventory to meet our immediate needs regarding our planned clinical trials.
 For future work involving the drug product, it is anticipated that manufacture process development work will continue, with focus of manufacturing improvements, and increasing scale. It is anticipated that future manufacturing of clinical trial materials may be required to fill clinical trial needs. Additional tyrosine derivative drug product variations have also been developed for research purposes and some are being validated and tested for clinical purposes.
 The three APIs for MPS are available from several contract manufacturers, each holding Drug Master Files at the FDA for their respective APIs. We believe that the loss of or the inability of, any of single source to provide our required ingredients would not have any substantive delaying effect on our research program, clinical trials or future commercial sale of SM-88, as we believe other sources are readily available.

Employees
 As of March 31, 2020, we had a total of 18 employees, all full-time and all located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Of the 18 employees, eight perform research and development activities and ten perform general and administrative functions. Our Chief Executive Officer, Steve Hoffman, is also our Chief Science Officer and, as such, may be considered engaged in R&D activities, for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, as well as his being categorized as serving in an administrative capacity. Based upon their roles and activities with us, certain other employees may also be categorized as serving in more than one role. Where necessary, we have entered into consulting contracts to provide us with subject matter expertise. We believe there is a sufficient number of available contractors with appropriate subject matter expertise for our current and near-term needs.

Collaboration with Eagle  
 On January 7, 2020, TYME and Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eagle”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Eagle SPA”), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to Eagle 10,000,000 shares of common stock, at a price of $2.00 per share. The Eagle SPA provides that Eagle will, subject to certain conditions, make an additional payment of $20 million upon the occurrence of a milestone event, which is defined as the earlier of (i) achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the TYME-88-Panc pivotal trial; or (ii) achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the PanCAN Precision Promise SM-88 registration arm; or (iii) FDA approval of SM-88 in any cancer indication. This payment would be split into a $10 million milestone cash payment and a $10 million investment in TYME at a 15% premium to the then prevailing market price. Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.
 Also, on January 7, 2020, we entered into a Co-Promotion Agreement with Eagle (the “Co-Promote”), whereby Eagle agreed to provide sales representatives to cover 25% of the Company’s sales force requirements and will receive 15% of the net sales of all SM-88 products in the U.S. during the term of the Co-Promote. TYME will also be responsible for clinical development, regulatory approval, commercial strategy, marketing, reimbursement and manufacturing of SM-88. TYME retains the remaining 85% of net U.S. revenues and reserves the right to repurchase Eagle’s rights under the Co-Promote for $200 million.

 Corporate History; Significant Organizational Events
 We were originally incorporated in Florida as Global Group Enterprises Corp. on November 22, 2011. Effective as of September 18, 2014, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware and later engaged in a merger and certain other transactions. As a result of these events and related transactions, among other things, we (i) changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Florida to Delaware; (ii) changed our name from Global Group Enterprises Corp. to Tyme Technologies, Inc., and (iii) acquired our current clinical-stage pharmaceutical business.

 At-the-Market Sales of Common StockIn November 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Canaccord Genuity Inc. (“Canaccord”), pursuant to which we were able to sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $30,000,000 through Canaccord, as our sales agent, in an at-the-market offering (the “ATM”). In total, we sold 3,927,248 shares of our common stock under this equity distribution agreement for net proceeds of $11,492,261 after commissions of $359,866 and other transaction expenses.
 24


In October 2019, TYME terminated the equity distribution agreement with Canaccord and entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the “Sale Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”) as sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, sell shares of Common Stock through Jefferies having an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million (the “Jefferies ATM”). Since initiation, we have raised approximately $1.5 million in net proceeds after commissions and other transaction expenses and have sold 1,361,315 shares of Common Stock.
 Underwritten Securities Offering
 On March 6, 2018, TYME closed an underwritten public offering of 10.4 million shares of its Common Stock, at a public offering price of $2.25 per share and received net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before our expenses of the offering, of approximately $21.89 million. 

 On April 2, 2019, the Company closed an underwritten registered offering of 8,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and warrants to purchase up to 8,000,000 shares of its common stock with an exercise price of $2.00 per share at a combined purchase price of $1.50 per share of common stock and accompanying warrant (the “Existing Warrants”). The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $11 million. 
Exchange Agreements
 
On May 20, 2020, the Company entered into exchange agreements with holders (the “Holders”) of the Existing Warrants. The Existing Warrants were offered and issued pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-211489), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 16, 2017, a base prospectus dated August 16, 2017 and a prospectus supplement dated March 28, 2019.

Pursuant to exchange agreements (the “Share Exchange Agreements”) with Holders of Existing Warrants to purchase 5,833,333 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,406,250 shares of Common stock (the “Exchange Shares”) in exchange for such Existing Warrants. Concurrently therewith, each such Holder executed and delivered to the Company a leak-out agreement  (a “Share Leak-Out Agreement”) that contains trading restrictions with respect to the Exchange Shares, which (i) for the first 90 days, prohibit any sales of Exchange Shares, (ii) for the subsequent 90 days, limit sales of Exchange Shares on any day to 2.5% of that day’s trading volume of Common Stock, and (iii) prohibit new short positions or short sales on Common Stock for the combined 180 day period.

The Company also entered into an exchange agreement (the “Warrant Exchange Agreement”) with another Holder of Existing Warrants to purchase 2,166,667 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate.  Pursuant to the Warrant Exchange Agreement, the Company issued such Holder a new warrant (the “New Warrant”) to purchase the same number of shares of Common Stock. The New Warrant has the same expiration date, April 2, 2024, as the Existing Warrants, but has an exercise price of $1.80 and does not include the price protection, anti-dilution provisions or other restrictions on Company action from the Existing Warrants. Concurrently therewith, such Holder executed and delivered to the Company a leak-out agreement that contains trading restrictions on sales of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the New Warrant that are substantially similar to the restrictions on Exchange Shares in the Share Leak-Out Agreement, provided that the leak-out restrictions will only apply to the first 893,750 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the New Warrant.
