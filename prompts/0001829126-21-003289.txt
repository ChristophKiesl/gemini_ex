Overview
 
Sipp International Industries, Inc f/k/a Industrial International, Inc., (the “Company” or “IDUL”), a Nevada corporation, incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on January 11, 1991. IDUL was accepted for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board on December 7, 2001, and organized originally to propose, plan and developing a golf course in either Moapa area or Overton Valley area in Nevada.
 
As described in Note 2 below, before the reorganization with Broad Faith Limited (“BFL”), a company incorporated under the International Business Companies Act of the British Virgin Islands on February 10, 2003, IDUL was a development stage company, which, other than a proposed golf course project in Nevada, has had no operations. After recapitalization, IDUL exited the development stage in the quarter ended March 31, 2003.
 
IDUL and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the development, production and distribution throughout China of communications terminal products, mainly corded and cordless telephones which are sold under the trademark, Wondial (TM) through a 69.5296% owned affiliate, Shenzhen Wonderland Communication Science & Technology Company Limited (“Wondial”) and battery testing equipment and battery products through a 72.84% owned affiliate, Wuhan Lixing Power Sources Company Limited (“WLPS”).
 
On May 17, 2004, the Company filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. On May 24, 2004, the Company’s auditors, Moores, Rowland, and Mazars resigned due to a disagreement with the Company and due to the fact that they had not reviewed the Company’s 10-Q filing prior to submission to the SEC. Subsequent to the filing for March 31, 2004, the Company stopped reporting until a Form 15-12G was filed on July 18, 2011. As a result, for the purposes of these financial statements, all assets were considered disposed of as of December 31, 2004, and all liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2003, remained and were carryforward without change.
 
On December 9, 2003, IDUL announced that it has initiated a program to buy back up to 500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. Before the end of fiscal year 2003, IDUL has entered into an agreement with a third party to repurchase 200,000 shares of common stock of IDUL at USD2.93 per share. The consideration was settled in January 2004.

In January 2004, IDUL’s wholly-owned subsidiary, BFL entered into an agreement to dispose its 95% owned affiliate, Shenzhen Kexuntong Industrial Company Limited (“SKI”) which owned 68.7288% shareholdings in Wondial to its principal stockholder, Mr. Tsui Kit, for a purchase price equal to 105% of the appraised value of net assets of SKI as of December 31, 2003 (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price shall be payable by the cancellation of amount of USD7,662 due to Mr. Tsui Kit in connection with the acquisition of LPI, as described in Note 2 (b) above and the transfer to IDUL of such number of shares of restricted common stock of IDUL owned by Mr. Tsui Kit (the aggregate fair market value of which shall be set at the closing price of such shares as of the date of the execution of the acquisition agreement) equal to the difference between the Purchase Price and the obligation of USD7,662. The disposal is expected to close after March 2004.
 
On February 25, 2004, IDUL completed a private equity financing pursuant to which it raised gross proceeds of USD5,800. The transaction was a unit offering pursuant to which IDUL issued a total of 2,521,745 shares of common stock together with warrants to purchase an additional 756,530 shares of common stock. The price per unit was $2.30 and the warrant exercise price is $2.70 per share.
 
On May 24, 2004, the Company received a letter of resignation from its independent auditors, Moores Rowland Mazars (“Moores Rowland”). The letter from Moores Rowland stated that its review of the Company’s March 31, 2004, Form 10-Q Quarterly Report, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 17, 2004, was not complete and therefore the document should not have been filed.
 
Moores Rowland audited the Company’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003. Moores Rowland’s reports on the Company’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, there were no disagreements between the Company and Moores Rowland on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Moores Rowland, would have caused Moores Rowland to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, there were no such events as described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K during such period.
 
However, during the interim period from January 1, 2004 through the date of Moores Rowland’s resignation on May 24, 2004, there was disagreement between the Company and Moores Rowland in connection with the filing of the March 31, 2004 Form 10-Q Quarterly Report. There are three primary events for which Moores Rowland believes the disclosures were not properly or fully disclosed in such document:
 

(1) | the SKI Disposal and its completion as defined herein;
----+-------------------------------------------------------


(2) | the April 5, 2004 Assignment as defined herein; and
----+----------------------------------------------------


(3) | the Wondial Bankruptcy Order as defined herein.
----+------------------------------------------------

 
There was a disagreement between the Company and Moores Rowland as to the issue of whether the Company provided adequate disclosure with respect to the disposal of the SKI assets, either in a Form 8-K Current Report or in the Company’s March 31, 2004, Form 10-Q Quarterly Report filed on May 17, 2004. SKI, a subsidiary of Broad Faith Limited, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was sold to the Company’s Chairman and CEO, Dr. Kit Tsui. The agreement with respect to this transaction was disclosed in the notes to the Company’s financial statements, which were included in the December 31, 2003, Form 10-K Annual Report, and the closing of the transaction was disclosed in the Company’s March 31, 2004, Form 10-Q Quarterly Report. Dr. Tsui acquired SKI’s surplus equipment used to manufacture analog and digital cordless and traditional corded phones so that the Company could focus on the more profitable telecommunications products distribution business. Dr. Tsui paid the Company $12,318,840 by agreeing to surrender 1,206,435 shares of the Company’s common stock. Also, he agreed to eliminate $7.662 million in debt the Company owed him and assumed $8.77 million in bank debt that SKI owed. The accounting firm of Shenzhen Fa Wei provided a fairness opinion in connection with the sale of the assets.

Further, on April 5, 2004, Dr. Tsui, Shenzhen Wonderland Communication Science & Technology Company Limited (“Wondial”), a subsidiary of SKI, and a PRC bank signed an assignment agreement making Wondial the obligor of debt amounting to approximately $25 million, which Dr. Tsui personally owed to a PRC bank. Accordingly, subsequent to April 5, 2004, Wondial owed the bank approximately $25 million. Moores Rowland contends that the assignment occurred before Wondial was seized by the Chinese government on April 27, 2004, which would have been a violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a related-party transaction had the closing of the SKI Disposal occurred after the April 5, 2004 Assignment. However, the Company maintains that the transaction did not occur in that manner. It is the Company’s position that SKI and, accordingly, Wondial, was disposed of on March 29, 2004, in the sale to Dr. Tsui and not as a result of the April 27, 2004 bankruptcy seizure as alleged by Moores Rowland. Since the April 5, 2004 Assignment and Wondial Bankruptcy Order occurred after the effective date of the SKI Disposal, it is the Company’s position that any transaction between Dr. Kit Tsui and Wondial subsequent to that date would not be deemed a related party transaction.
 
Finally, Moores Rowland stated that it was unable to complete its review of the March 31, 2004, Form 10-Q Quarterly Report because it was unable to examine a full set of accounting books and records of Wondial for the three months ended March 31, 2004. Such information with respect to the finances and accounting of Wondial had not been provided to Moores Rowland because Wondial’s documents had been seized and its offices closed by the Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court pursuant to a Bankruptcy Order on April 27, 2004. Moores Rowland noted in its correspondence to the Company that it did not fully review the March 31, 2004, Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and did not have adequate information about Wondial’s operations for the three months ended March 31, 2004. The Company believes that Moores Rowland did have access to this information prior to its seizure. Nevertheless, Moores Rowland believes these issues were not addressed to its satisfaction.
 
Information may have come to the attention of Moores Rowland that could if further investigated, materially impact the fairness, reliability, or presentation of the financial statements issued subsequent to the date of the December 31, 2003, audited financial statements. However, because of Moores Rowland’s resignation, it was not able to conduct a further investigation. Moores Rowland, in correspondence dated May 14, 2004, advised the Company to file a notice of late filing and cautioned directors not to file the March 31, 2004, Form 10-Q Quarterly Report until its review was complete. Moreover, on May 18, 2004, Moores Rowland advised directors of the Company to (i) file an amendment to the March 31, 2004, Form 10-Q Quarterly Report to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission that a full accounting review had not been completed, (ii) obtain legal advice as to that issue, and (iii) attend to any unresolved matters. The Company maintains that it received correspondence from Moores Rowland indicating that it did review the financial statements contained in the March 31, 2004 Form 10-Q Quarterly Report. The Company is investigating these matters further and will continue to disclose any further information as it arises.
 
On July 15, 2011, the Company filed Form 15 Certification and Notice of Termination of Registration under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or suspension of duty to file reports under sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
On July 11, 2019, Custodian Ventures LLC, applied for appointment as Custodian of the Company by the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada. On August 28, 2019, the eight judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC as the custodian for Sipp International Industries, Inc., proper notice having been given to the officers and directors of Sipp International Industries, Inc. There was no opposition. On August 29, 2019, the Company filed a certificate of revival with the state of Nevada, appointing David Lazar as, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director.
 
Company is a Blank Check Company
 
At present, the Company is a development stage company with no revenues, no assets and no specific business plan or purpose. The Company’s business plan is to seek new business opportunities or to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company. As a result, the Company is a “blank check company” and, as a result, any offerings of the Company’s securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) must comply with Rule 419 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Act. The Company’s Common Stock is a “penny stock,” as defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act. The Penny Stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about Penny Stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.

The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each Penny Stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, the Penny Stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the Penny Stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the Penny Stock rules. So long as the common stock of the Company is subject to the Penny Stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell the Company’s common stock.
 
We are a “Shell Company,” as defined in Rule 405 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. A Shell Company is one that has no or nominal operations and either: (i) no or nominal assets; or (ii) assets consisting primarily of cash or cash equivalents. As a Shell Company, we are restricted in our use of Registrations on Form S-8 under the Securities Act; the lack of availability of the use of Rule 144 by security holders; and the lack of liquidity in our stock.
 
Form S-8
 
Shell companies are prohibited from using Form S-8 to register securities under the Securities Act. If a company ceases to be a Shell Company, it may use Form S-8 sixty calendar days, provided it has filed all reports and other materials required to be filed under the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that it has been required to file such reports and materials after the company files “Form 10 information,” which is information that a company would be required to file in a registration statement on Form 10 if it were registering a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. This information would normally be reported on a current report on Form 8-K reporting the completion of a transaction that caused the company to cease being a Shell Company.
 
Unavailability of Rule 144 for Resale
 
Rule 144(i) “Unavailability to Securities of Issuers With No or Nominal Operations and No or Nominal Non-Cash Assets” provides that Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by an issuer that is a Shell Company. We have identified our company as a Shell Company and, therefore, the holders of our securities may not rely on Rule 144 to have the restriction removed from their securities without registration or until the Company is no longer identified as a Shell Company and has filed all requisite periodic reports under the Exchange Act for the period of twelve (12) months.
 
As a result of our classification as a Shell Company, our investors are not allowed to rely on the “safe harbor” provisions of Rule 144, promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act, so as not to be considered underwriters in connection with the sale of our securities until one year from the date that we cease to be a Shell Company. This will likely make it more difficult for us to attract additional capital through subsequent unregistered offerings because purchasers of securities in such unregistered offerings will not be able to resell their securities in reliance on Rule 144, a safe harbor on which holders of restricted securities usually rely to resell securities.
 
Very Limited Liquidity of our Common Stock
 
Our common stock occasionally trades on the OTC Pink Sheet Market, as there is no active market maker in our common stock. As a result, there is only limited liquidity in our common stock.
 
We will be deemed a blank check company under Rule 419 of the Securities Act
 
The provisions of Rule 419 apply to registration statements filed under the Securities Act by a blank check company, such as the Company. Rule 419 requires that a blank check company filing a registration statement deposit the securities being offered and proceeds of the offering into an escrow or trust account pending the execution of an agreement for an acquisition or merger. While we are not currently registering shares for an offering, we may do so in the future.

In addition, an issuer is required to file a post-effective amendment to a registration statement upon the execution of an agreement for an acquisition or merger. The rule provides procedures for the release of the offering funds, if any, in conjunction with the post effective acquisition or merger. The obligations to file post-effective amendments are in addition to the obligations to file Forms 8-K to report for both the entry into a material definitive (non-ordinary course of business) agreement and the completion of the transaction. Rule 419 applies to both primary and re-sale or secondary offerings.
 
Within five (5) days of filing a post-effective amendment setting forth the proposed terms of an acquisition, the Company must notify each investor whose shares are in escrow, if any. Each such investor then has no fewer than 20 and no greater than 45 business days to notify the Company in writing if they elect to remain an investor. A failure to reply indicates that the person has elected to not remain an investor. As all investors are allotted this second opportunity to determine to remain an investor, acquisition agreements should be conditioned upon enough funds remaining in escrow to close the transaction.
 
Effecting a business combination
 
Prospective investors in the Company’s common stock will not have an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any of the one or more business combinations that we may undertake A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which needs to raise substantial additional capital by means of being a publicly trading company, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and State securities laws. A business combination may involve a company which may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth.
 
The Company has not identified a target business or target industry
 
The Company’s effort in identifying a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry and the Company may ultimately acquire a business in any industry Management deems appropriate. To date, the Company has not selected any target business on which to concentrate our search for a business combination. While the Company intends to focus on target businesses in the United States, it is not limited to U.S. entities and may consummate a business combination with a target business outside of the United States. Accordingly, there is no basis for investors in the Company’s common stock to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business or the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate. To the extent we effect a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, to the extent that we effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. An extremely high level of risk frequently characterizes many industries which experience rapid growth. In addition, although the Company’s Management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Sources of target businesses
 
Our Management anticipates that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers and other members of the financial community, who may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. Our Management may also bring to our attention target business candidates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee or other compensation in connection with a business combination. In no event, however, will we pay Management any finder’s fee or other compensation for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of a business combination.

Probable lack of business diversification
 
While we may seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business, it is more probable that we will only have the ability to effect a single business combination, if at all. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations with entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will lack the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | result in our dependency upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 

 
Limited ability to evaluate the target business’ Management
 
We cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ Management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future Management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to man age a public company intending to embark on a program of business development. Furthermore, the future role of our director, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty.
 
While it is possible that our director will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that he will devote his full efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our director will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent Management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent Management.
 
Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
 
Our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, were prepared using the assumption that we will continue our operations as a going concern. Our independent accountants in their audit report have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our operations are dependent on our ability to raise sufficient capital or complete business combination as a result of which we become profitable. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There is not enough cash on hand to fund our administrative expenses and operating expenses for the next twelve months. Therefore, we may be unable to continue operations in the future as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company’s shares of common stock.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations, either directly or through affiliates. Many if not virtually most of these competitors possess far greater financial, human and other resources compared to our resources. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we may identify, our ability to compete in acquiring certain of the more desirable target businesses will be limited by our limited financial and human resources. Our inherent competitive limitations are expected by Management to give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business that we may identify and seek to pursue. Further, any of these limitations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our Management believes, however, that our status as a reporting public entity with potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over certain privately-held entities having a similar business objective in acquiring a desirable target business with growth potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from existing competitors of the business we acquire. In particular, certain industries which experience rapid growth frequently attract an increasingly larger number of competitors, including those with far greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than the initial competitors in the industry in which we seek to operate. The degree of competition characterizing the industry of any prospective target business cannot presently be ascertained. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively, especially to the extent that the target business is in a high-growth industry.
