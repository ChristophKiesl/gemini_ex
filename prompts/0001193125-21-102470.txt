ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------


Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (“D&B Entertainment”) is a leading owner and operator of high-volume entertainment and dining venues (“stores”) that operate under the name “Dave & Buster’s.” We offer our 
 
3 

  customers the opportunity to “Eat Drink Play and Watch” all in one location. We provide our customers the most social, shareable fun, with high-quality food and beverages as well as interactive entertainment options for adults and families to enjoy together. We opened the first Dave & Buster’s store in Dallas, Texas in 1982, and as of January 31, 2021 (the last day of fiscal 2020), we owned and operated 140 stores located in 40 states, Puerto Rico and one Canadian province. Unless otherwise provided in this report, references to “Dave & Buster’s,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to D&B Entertainment and its wholly owned subsidiaries and any predecessor entities. 
 Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday after the Saturday closest to January 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except in a 53-week year when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. Fiscal 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2016 each contained 52 weeks. Fiscal 2017 contained 53 weeks. We refer to our fiscal years as 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 throughout this report. 
 Eat Drink Play and Watch - All Under One Roof 
 We have developed a distinctive brand based on our customer value proposition: “Eat Drink Play and Watch.” The interaction between dining, enjoying our full-service bar, playing games, and watching sports and other entertainment is the defining feature of the Dave & Buster’s customer experience. We believe this combination creates an experience at a single location that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Our stores are also designed to accommodate premium sports viewing events, private parties, business functions and other corporate-sponsored events. We believe we appeal to a diverse customer base by creating a highly customizable experience in a dynamic and fun setting. 
Eat 
 We strive to differentiate our food with quality, flavorful offerings guided by an “Inspired American Kitchen” identity. This identity is rooted in enhanced flavors and quality ingredients across a condensed number of menu items that enables our customers to explore new flavors while offering a balanced selection of familiar dishes. Our menu also simplifies execution, and along with recent kitchen enhancements allows us to deliver dishes to customers hotter and faster to drive an improved customer experience. While our menu appeals to a broad spectrum of customers, we continue to evolve it to reflect the changing tastes of our customers, with options for full meals as well as grabbing an appetizer to share with friends. We deliver high-quality offerings, including a wide variety of starters, one-of-a-kind burgers and handhelds, choice-grade steaks, pasta, and low calorie, vegetarian, and gluten friendly options. We believe our broad menu offers something for everyone and is appropriate for many different occasions. To ensure that we stay on-trend, we update our menus regularly with new food items or limited time offers. Our food revenues, which include non-alcoholic beverages, accounted for approximately 66% of our food and beverage revenues and approximately 24.1% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020. 
 Drink 
 Each of our locations also offers full bar service, including a variety of beers, hand-crafted cocktails, and premium spirits. We are focused on maintaining a streamlined beverage menu for ease of execution, while using quality ingredients including fresh juices, purees and house-made mixers. Beverage service is typically available throughout the entire store, allowing for multiple point of sale opportunities. We believe that our high margin beverage offering is complementary to each of the Eat, Play and Watch aspects of our brand. Our alcoholic beverage revenues accounted for approximately 34% of our total food and beverage revenues and approximately 12.4% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020. 
Play 
 The games in our Midway are a key aspect of the Dave & Buster’s entertainment experience, which we believe is the core differentiating feature of our brand. The Midway in each of our stores is an area where we 
 
4 

  offer a wide array of amusement and entertainment options, some of which are exclusive to Dave & Buster’s on a permanent or temporary basis. Each of our stores typically has approximately 150 redemption and simulation games as well as our proprietary virtual reality platform. Most of our games are activated by game play credits on cards or other RFID devices (collectively, “Power Cards”). A customer purchases a Power Card with game play credits or “chips” at an automated kiosk, through our mobile application, or from one of our team members. Our amusement and other revenues accounted for approximately 63.5% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020. Redemption games, which represented approximately 71% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2020, offer our customers the opportunity to win tickets that are redeemable at a retail-style space in our stores that we have branded WIN!, with prizes ranging from branded novelty items to high-end electronics. We believe this “opportunity to win” creates a fun and highly energized social experience that is an important aspect of the Dave & Buster’s in-store experience and cannot be easily replicated at home. Many of our non-redemption games, which include our virtual reality, video, and simulation offerings, can be played by multiple customers simultaneously and include some of the latest high-tech games that are commercially available. These games represented approximately 27% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2020. Other amusements, such as billiards and bowling, represented the remainder of our amusement revenues in fiscal 2020. 
 Watch 
 Sports-viewing is another key component of the entertainment experience at Dave & Buster’s. All of our stores have multiple large screen televisions and high-quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports and other immersive programming. For 56 of our stores, we have an enhanced Watch experience with huge cutting-edge LED “Wow Walls”, that differentiates Dave & Buster’s by delivering an elevated viewing experience and providing a platform for broader programming and marketing opportunities. Our “D&B Sports” areas offer an immersive viewing environment that provides customers with large, high definition televisions, to watch community-focused sports programming and enjoy our full bar and food menu. We believe that we have created an attractive and comfortable environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience for customers, and our goal is to build awareness of D&B Sports as “the best place to watch sports” and the “only place to watch the games and play the games.” 
Competitive Positioning 
 The out-of-home entertainment market is highly competitive. We compete for customers’ discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, night clubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. We also face competition from local, regional, and national establishments that offer similar entertainment experiences and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food. Some of these establishments may exist in multiple locations, and we may also face competition on a national basis in the future from other concepts that are similar to our concept. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie streaming and delivery. 
 The key elements that drive our total customer experience and help position us from a competitive standpoint include the following: 
 Strong, distinctive brand with broad customer appeal. We believe that the multi-faceted customer experience of “Eat Drink Play and Watch” at Dave & Buster’s, supported by our extensive marketing reach has helped us create a widely recognized brand. We have a high degree of awareness of our brand as a dining and entertainment venue, and a broad customer appeal with an attractive target demographic. Our primary target is adults 21-39, but we are also attractive to families, which make up approximately 40% of our mix. 
 Multi-faceted customer experience highlights our value proposition. We believe that our combination of interactive games, attractive television viewing areas, high-quality dining and full-service beverage offerings, 
 
5 

  delivered in a highly-energized atmosphere, provides a multi-faceted customer experience that cannot be easily replicated at home or elsewhere without having to visit multiple destinations. We aim to offer our customers a value proposition comparable or superior to many of the separately available dining and entertainment options. We are continuously working with game manufacturers and others to create new games and attractions that include content that is exclusively available at Dave & Buster’s on a permanent or temporary basis. Our new games in combination with new food and beverage offerings and focused attention to the customer experience help us to retain and generate customer traffic. Our value proposition is enhanced by marketing initiatives, including free game play that often features the introduction of our new games, Supercharge Power Card offerings (when purchasing or adding value to a Power Card, the customer is given the opportunity to add more chips to the Power Card at a lower price per chip), and Half-Price Game Play (every Wednesday, from open to close, we reduce the price of games in the Midway by one-half). We believe these initiatives encourage customers to participate more fully across our broad range of food, beverage and entertainment offerings. 
 Vibrant, contemporary store design that integrates entertainment and dining. We continue to enhance the Dave & Buster’s brand through our store design, including our D&B Sports concept. Our core store design provides a contemporary, engaging atmosphere for our customers with clearly differentiated spaces designed to convey the components of our customer value proposition: “Eat Drink Play and Watch.” The oversized graphics and images throughout the store are intended to communicate our brand personality by being fun, contemporary, and larger-than-life. The dining room décor includes booth and table seating and colorful artwork, often featuring local landmarks. Our WIN! area provides a retail-like environment where customers can redeem their tickets for prizes. We believe our D&B Sports area provides an attractive opportunity to market our broader platform to new and existing customers through a year-round calendar of programming and promotions tied to popular sporting events and sport-related activities. The large television screens, comfortable seating, a full menu of food and beverages and artwork often featuring images of local sports teams and sports icons help create what we believe to be an exciting environment for watching sports and other programming. 
 Strong history of growth. We have a proven track record of improving operating results and expanding the footprint of our brand. While fiscal 2020 was a very unusual year with the impact of COVID-19, from fiscal 2015 to 2019, net income increased by $92.6 million, EBITDA margins increased by approximately 130 basis points and our Adjusted EBITDA Margins (both defined in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) increased by approximately 120 basis points. During times of normal operations, we expect our continued focus on operating performance and leveraging of expenses will positively impact operating margins and will partially offset pressure from wage inflation and occupancy costs, although there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful. 
 Store model generates favorable store economics and strong returns. We believe our store model offering entertainment, food, and beverage provides certain benefits in comparison to traditional restaurant concepts, which is reflected in our historically higher revenue per store, higher comparable store operating income margins, and higher comparable Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins (defined in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures”). 
 Our entertainment offerings have low variable costs and produced gross margins of 89.3% for fiscal 2020. With approximately 63.5% of our revenues from entertainment, we have less exposure than traditional restaurant concepts to food costs, which represented approximately 7.0% of our total revenues in fiscal 2020. Our business model generates strong cash flow that we can use to execute our growth strategy. We believe the combination of our operating income margins, our Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins, our refined new store formats and the fact that our stores typically open with high volumes that drive margins in year one will help us achieve our targeted average year one cash-on-cash returns of approximately 35% and five-year average cash-on-cash returns in excess of 25%. Historical cash-on-cash returns through fiscal 2019 were well above target, although a decline was realized in fiscal 2020 due to impacts from COVID-19. We define and calculate cash-on-cash returns for an individual store as (a) Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and 
 
6 

  Amortization, excluding pre-opening expenses, national marketing expense allocation, non-cash charges related to asset disposals, currency transactions and changes in non-cash deferred amusement revenue, divided by (b) our net development costs. Net development costs include equipment, building, leaseholds and site costs, net of tenant improvement allowances and other landlord payments, excluding pre-opening costs and capitalized interest. 
 Commitment to customer satisfaction. We aim to enhance our combination of food, beverage, and entertainment offerings through our service philosophy of providing a high quality and consistent customer experience through dedicated training and development of our team members and a corporate culture that encourages employee engagement. Due to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business during fiscal 2020, we temporarily paused the use of a national customer survey platform. In 2019, 86.0% of respondents to our Guest Satisfaction Survey rated us “Top Box” (score of 5 out of a possible 5) in “Overall Experience” and 87.2% of respondents rated us “Top Box” in “Intent to Recommend.” Through our loyalty program, we email offers and coupons to members and notify them of new games, food, drinks, and local events. In addition, members can earn game play credits based on the dollar amount of qualifying purchases at our stores. We expect that as our loyalty program grows it will be an important method of maintaining customers’ connection with our brand and further drive customer satisfaction. 
 Strategy 
 During fiscal 2020, we focused on the re-opening of our stores after mandated shutdowns related to COVID-19, but also refreshed our strategy to set us up for the next phase of growth. As part of this initiative, we commissioned external consultants to provide insight and review opportunities to assist in refreshing our strategy built on the following key components: 
 Drive our comparable store sales. We intend to differentiate our brand from other food and entertainment alternatives and drive our comparable sales, in a competitive landscape, through the following strategies: 
 

• | Offer novel food & drink to bring people together. We rolled out a new menu in March 2021 to provide a differentiated food and beverage offering based on an “Inspired American Kitchen” identity. We aim to improve overall food quality, and to offer a wide variety of items including starters and shareable items, one-of-a-kind burgers and handhelds, choice-grade steaks, pasta, and low calorie, vegetarian, and gluten friendly options. We also plan to improve efficiency by simplifying execution, allowing us to deliver dishes hotter and faster to drive an improved customer experience. For our beverage offering, we plan to update the offering based on customer research, and plan to streamline the selection to improve execution efficiency. For both food and beverage, we aim to periodically introduce new items, and run limited time offers during key periods.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offer the latest entertainment to enjoy together. We believe that our Midway games are the core differentiating feature of the Dave & Buster’s brand, and staying current with the latest offerings promotes trial and provides an exciting environment to enjoy games with friends and family, especially with the latest multiplayer games and challenges. We plan to continually update our games each year through development of innovative and proprietary games and the purchase of new games that will resonate with our customers and drive brand relevance due to a variety of factors, including their large scale, eye-catching appearance, virtual reality features, association with recognizable brands or the fact that they cannot be easily replicated at home. We also intend to extend our programming capabilities by offering more curated content and creating a calendar of ongoing and one-time events leveraging our investments in the best and latest audio-visual technology.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Align team and integrated experience. We intend to consistently drive service excellence, including the use of technology to improve speed of service and to give our customers more control over their in-store experience. We will also refresh our commitment to serving customers through an improved hiring, training and service model, and our team will help create fun and bring our new strategies to life.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



7 

  
• | Drive customer engagement. We will focus on delivering personalized messaging that connects with the customer to drive incremental visitation and will focus our advertising on communicating the emotional side of our brand promise. In addition, we will continue to leverage our customer relationship management program and our growing loyalty database by delivering more targeted individualized offers and creative content.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Invest in new stores. We believe that the Dave & Buster’s brand has significant growth opportunities, as internal studies and third-party research suggests a total store potential in the United States and Canada in excess of 230 stores (including our 140 stores as of the end of fiscal 2020). We opened six stores and closed two stores in fiscal 2020. We will maintain a moderate pace of new store openings in fiscal 2021 as our business recovers from the impact of COVID-19 and as we focus on the re-opening of our remaining closed stores. Longer term, the number of openings will depend on many factors, including our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms, generate sufficient operating cash flows or utilize available cash to finance construction of leasehold improvements and pre-opening costs, obtain necessary local governmental permits, and recruit and train management and hourly personnel. 
 Regarding our long-term strategy of new store growth, we base new site selection on an analytical evaluation of a set of drivers we believe increase the probability of successful, high-volume stores, including site visibility, accessibility and traffic volume, and trade area demographics The experience and relationships of our current development team has enabled us to focus our attention on the most relevant network of real estate brokers, which has given us access to a larger pool of qualified potential store sites. In addition, we believe the more contemporary look of our stores has been one of the key drivers in attracting new developers and building our new store pipeline. 
 We currently operate stores varying in size from 16,000 to 70,000 square feet. To optimize sales per square foot and further enhance our store economics we currently utilize three basic formats when designing new stores. The target size of our future large format stores is expected to be between 30,001 and 45,000 square feet, the target size of our future medium format stores is expected to be between 25,001 and 30,000 square feet while our small format stores are below 25,001 square feet. At January 31, 2021, we operated 110 large format stores, 20 medium format stores and 10 small format stores. 
 We believe that the smaller store format allows us to reduce capital investment risk per store. For the smaller format, we have reduced the back-of-house space and optimized the customer facing area dedicated to video and redemption games. We believe that the smaller format maintains the dynamic customer experience that is the foundation of our brand and allows us flexibility in our site selection process. 
 Human Capital Management 
 Our team members are the heart of our Company, and they help us run the fun in our stores every day. We depend on our team members to provide great service and maintain consistently strong operations. Our ability to attract and retain an engaged and experienced team is critical to successful execution of our business strategies. While we continue to operate in a competitive labor environment, we believe our culture, policies, and labor practices contribute to strong relations with our team members. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Our success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified store management and operating personnel while also controlling our labor costs.”) 
 Our Culture 
 In our stores and at our corporate office, we are committed to being fun creators. Our team members share a deep commitment to four culture pillars, which describe the relationships our team members have with our customers and each other. We are devoted to our “You Got It” service philosophy that calls us to provide exceptional service to our customers and to each other every day. Our “Play Your Heart Out” attitude encourages 
 
8 

  intensity, hard work, and having fun. We firmly believe we are “Better Together,” and through this culture pillar we encourage inclusivity, teamwork, and good judgment. Finally, we encourage all team members to be “Game Changers” committed to innovation, embracing change, and continuous learning and growth. 
 Our Team 
 As of January 31, 2021, we employed 8,547 team members, 208 of whom served at our corporate headquarters, 1,026 of whom served as management personnel and the remainder of whom were hourly personnel. Included in our total team members are 758 store and corporate team members who remain on furlough while the Company continues its recovery, 42% of which are management personnel. 
 Our Better Together culture pillar binds us to a shared commitment to attract, retain, engage, and develop a team that mirrors the diversity of the customers we serve. We strive to provide inclusive fun for all, and we believe our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion promotes teamwork to achieve our common goals, helps our team members reach their highest potential at work, enables our team members to make better decisions to serve all of our stakeholders, and fuels innovation. Racial minorities make up over 53% of our U.S. workforce, and we are proud of our diversity, which is summarized below: 
 

 | Male | | | Female | | Total
White | | 23.9 | % | | 22.6 | % | 46.5 | %
Black or African American | | 14.4 | % | | 11.7 | % | 26.1 | %
Hispanic | | 12.3 | % | | 9.6 | % | 21.9 | %
Asian/American Indian/Pacific Islander | | 2.1 | % | | 1.4 | % | 3.5 | %
Two or more races | | 1.2 | % | | 0.8 | % | 2.0 | %
Total | | 53.9 | % | | 46.1 | % | 100.0 | %


In fiscal 2020, we strengthened our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Among other key accomplishments, we: 
 

• | adopted an enterprise Human Rights policy, which may be found on our Company website;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | formed a Human Resources Steering Committee comprised of leaders from different levels and departments in our organization that is specifically charged with stewardship of, and ensuring accountability to, our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy and goals;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set goals for improving representation of women and team members who are black, indigenous, or people of color in our corporate and field leadership, and began providing quarterly updates to our Board of Directors on our progress in meeting our goals; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improved representation of women in our internal governance committees by more than 50%, and increased representation of team members who are black, indigenous, or people of color on these same committees by nearly 100%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In addition to our focus on improving diversity, equity, and inclusion, fiscal 2020 also demanded additional focus on the health and safety for our team members and our customers. Health and safety have always been a top priority for our Company, but in response to the pandemic, we implemented several changes for the protection of our team members and our customers. Our cross-functional COVID-19 response team met frequently throughout the pandemic to review the latest guidance from health agencies, update our safety protocols and ensure team members across our Company had the opportunity to collaborate and share in our collective commitment to health and safety. Among other actions, we: 
 

• | worked together to adhere to all local, state and federal health guidelines and requirements in setting capacity limits, hours of operation, determining what service and product offerings we were able to provide, establishing testing and close contact tracing protocols, and setting other operational policies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



9 

  
• | implemented health and temperature checks before each shift and required team members to wear protective masks and gloves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | were among the first casual dining brands to require all customers to wear masks following the onset of the pandemic;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | assigned team members to cleaning and sanitizing our stores full-time during all operating hours;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | added hand sanitizer stations at each store and socially distanced all tables, games, and line queues; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for most of fiscal 2020, the majority of our corporate team members worked remotely.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In fiscal 2020, our leaders worked to continue to maintain strong communications and relationships with our team members throughout the year. We believe our culture, policies, and labor practices contribute to strong relations with our team member. None of our team members are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage, strike, or labor dispute. 
 Our Leadership Team 
 We are led by a strong senior management team averaging over 20 years of experience with national brands spanning casual dining, entertainment, and other consumer-centric industries. We believe that our management team’s prior experience, combined with its experience at Dave & Buster’s provides us with insights into our customer base and enables us to create the dynamic environment that is core to our brand. 
Our Store Teams 
 Historically, our typical store team consisted of a General Manager supported by an average of eight additional management positions. During the COVID-19 recovery period, we significantly changed our management model, reducing the average additional management positions to approximately four, which was largely due to much lower store volumes upon re-opening. Management team members handle various departments within the store including responsibility for hourly team members. Historically, a typical store employed approximately 110 hourly team members, most of whom worked part-time. During the COVID-19 recovery period, the Company changed the hourly labor model, reducing the average to approximately 65 hourly team members. In the future, post-recovery, we intend to deploy a new labor model and leverage our technology investments, potentially requiring fewer management and/or hourly positions than historical levels. 
 The General Manager and the management team are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the store, including the hiring, training, and development of team members, as well as financial and operational performance. There is a defined structure of development and progression of job responsibilities within the supporting management positions to ensure that an adequate succession plan exists within each store. Each store is overseen by a Regional Operations Manager, Regional Operations Director or Vice President of Operations (collectively, “Regional Management”) who directly or indirectly report to our Chief Operating Officer. We are proud of the experience of our store leadership teams and carefully monitor store management team retention rates, which for us has consistently tracked in the top quartile of the upscale casual dining industry. 
 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our stores were generally open seven days a week, from 11:30 a.m. to midnight on Sunday through Thursday and 11:30 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. During the recovery, to comply with various federal, state and local guidelines and in response to changing guest levels, our stores have reduced the hours of operation and in some cases, the number of days operating in a week. 
 Attracting Talent 
 We seek to hire experienced leaders and team members and offer competitive wage and benefit programs. We offer performance-based compensation programs to our store management and corporate employees. In 
 
10 

  addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by employee level) include, among other items, bonuses, stock awards, and various employee assistance programs. In addition, our salaried and hourly team members are also eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan, medical/dental/vision insurance plans and receive vacation/paid time off based on tenure. While certain of our team members were on furlough due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered continued benefit coverage. 
 Developing Talent 
 We motivate and develop our team members by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement. Throughout the year, we provide numerous training opportunities for our team members, with a focus on continuous learning and development. With hundreds of leadership positions across our stores, we provide a pathway and training for individuals across the organization to advance from entry-level jobs into management roles. In addition, our geographic footprint often allows us to offer our store team members relocation options. 
 We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our stores through the careful training and supervision of our team members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, safety protocols, game playability and maintenance of our stores. We provide all new team members with comprehensive orientation and one-on-one training for their positions to help ensure they meet our high standards. All new team members are trained by partnering with a trainer to assure that the training and information they receive is complete and accurate. Team members are certified for their positions by passing a series of tests, including alcohol awareness and responsibility training for service team members. 
 We require our new store managers to complete an eight-week training program that includes front-of-house service, kitchen, amusements, and management responsibilities. Newly trained managers are then assigned to their home store, where they receive additional training with their General Manager. Their last two weeks of training include a comprehensive validation of new skills. We place a high priority on our continuing management development programs to ensure that qualified managers are available for our future openings. We conduct regular evaluations with each manager to discuss prior performance and future performance goals. We hold an annual General Manager conference in which our General Managers share best practices and receive an update on our business strategies. 
 When we open a new store, we provide varying levels of training to team members in each position to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the store from the first day it opens to the public. Prior to opening a new store, our dedicated training and opening team travels to the store to deliver an intensive training program for all team members. We believe this additional investment in our new stores is important because it helps us provide our customers with a quality experience from day one. After a store has been opened and is operating smoothly, the store managers supervise the training of new team members. 
 Corporate Responsibility 
 Our core value of “Better Together” calls each of our team members to care for each other, our customers, and the communities we serve. We will not do business with organizations that employ or condone unfair labor practices anywhere in the world. We partner with suppliers who share our commitment to ethical business conduct, fair labor practices, proven environmental, health, and safety practices, and environmental sustainability. We also specifically condemn human trafficking and abuse of child labor. We understand that supporting our communities includes being good environmental stewards and striving to conduct business in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner. 
 In addition, we strongly encourage team members to give back to the communities we serve. Although our Company invests time and resources in many charitable causes, we have two main causes we focus our efforts to support. The first is our long-standing partnership with Make-A-Wish. We have proudly supported 
 
11 

  Make-A-Wish since 2012. To date, we have given over $12.0 million to this worthy cause, and we participate in several events throughout the year both in our stores and at our corporate headquarters to raise money for Make-A-Wish. We also volunteer our time and talents to help. 
 In addition, we invest in helping our own team members during their times of greatest need. The D&B H.E.A.R.T. (Helping Employees at Rough Times) Fund is an independent non-profit established to create an employee assistance fund for the benefit of team members who suffer catastrophic events resulting in severe economic hardship. The D&B H.E.A.R.T. Fund is financed by contributions from our employees, customers, and business partners. During the pandemic, many of our team members were furloughed and experienced financial and personal hardships, and the D&B H.E.A.R.T. Fund provided financial assistance to several team members facing exceptionally tough challenges. 
 Advertising and Marketing 
 We use advertising and marketing to build awareness and strengthen our brand relevance. We spent approximately $21.1 million in marketing efforts in fiscal 2020, $44.8 million in fiscal 2019, and $40.8 million in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2020, as a result of the closures, capacity restrictions and other operating limitations imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we substantially curtailed    national cable television media, which continues to be the largest portion of our advertising and marketing spend. In the future, we plan to shift some funding to other forms of media, including investments in social and digital video, and test new types of programmatic display and digital audio. To enhance our marketing efforts, we also conduct digital initiatives including search engine marketing and optimization, mobile campaigns, and website improvements. We also execute periodic promotions, create in-store point-of-purchase materials and execute local marketing plans to address specific objectives in individual stores or markets. We work with external advertising, digital, media and design agencies in the development and execution of these programs. 
 During fiscal 2019, we invested in developing and implementing new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our customers and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in an increasingly connected society. Our investment efforts were significantly curtailed during fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we plan to continue to invest in fiscal 2021. Central to this effort is continued investment in our mobile application platform, which is used to enhance existing customer satisfaction and attract new customers by providing periodic exclusive offers and discounts and providing a convenient way to purchase Power Cards. We also intend to launch a new loyalty program in fiscal 2021, which will be integrated into the mobile application to provide further functionality and accessibility for our customers. 
 We utilize a number of other initiatives to continually improve our market effectiveness, including refining our marketing strategy to better reach both young adults and families, creating new advertising campaigns, investing in menu research and development to differentiate our food offerings from our competition and improve key product attributes (quality, consistency, value and overall customer satisfaction) and execution, developing product/promotional strategies to attract new customers and increase spending/length of stay, and reflecting a consistent brand identity that represents our positioning and commitment to quality. 
 Our special event marketing programs are managed by our sales department, which provides direction, training, and support to our special events team consisting of district sales managers and sales managers. Our special events programs are supported by targeted print and online media plans, as well as promotional incentives at appropriate times during the year. In addition, we have online booking for social parties to provide additional convenience in booking events for our customers. 
 Information Technology and Cyber Security 
 We utilize several proprietary and third-party management information systems. These systems are designed to enable our games’ functionality, improve operating efficiencies, provide us with timely access to financial and

  marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense. We believe our management information systems are sufficient to support our business plans. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria. 
 Our managers have daily routines focused on driving consistent execution in food, beverage, and amusements. While fiscal 2020 was a very unusual year with the impact of COVID-19, we historically utilized a customized food and beverage analysis program that determines the theoretical food and beverage costs for each store and provides additional tools and reports to help us identify opportunities, including waste management. In addition to our own routines, we leverage a third-party vendor to help ensure quality beverage operations, responsible alcohol service and loss prevention. Our workforce management platform also allows management to quickly add or reduce labor based on real-time business needs and historically assisted our managers in optimizing hourly labor based on anticipated sales volumes. Our amusement team uses a proprietary system that is supported by a mobile application that identifies amusement issues and needed repairs to help ensure our games are operational and meeting our ideal playing standard. Complementing this program is our routine preventative maintenance program, designed to prevent game failure and extend the functionality of our midway games. Consolidated reporting tools for the key drivers of our business are provided to our Regional Management to identify and troubleshoot any systemic issues. 
 During 2019, we invested in connectivity and data infrastructure to modernize and upgrade the capacity of our store systems, continued work on new, customer facing digital experiences, such as the launch of our new mobile application that supports in-store and off-premise amusement entertainment, and deployed hand-held point-of-sale devices to a limited group of stores. Our investment efforts were significantly curtailed during fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we plan to continue to invest in fiscal 2021. 
 We accept electronic payment cards from our customers for payment in our stores. We also receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and team members. We have systems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our customers’ credit card information and other private information we are required to protect, such as our employees’ personal information. Our existing cyber security policy includes cyber security techniques, tactics and procedures, including continuous monitoring and detection programs, network protections, employee training and awareness and incident response preparedness. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerability, perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our data security practices. We utilize a voluntary tool to help manage privacy risk by independently benchmarking our cyber security program to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, using an independent third party, and we share the results of our annual audit with our Audit Committee. 
 Food Preparation, Quality Control and Purchasing 
 We strive to maintain high food quality standards. To ensure our quality standards are met, we negotiate directly with independent producers of food products. We provide detailed quality and yield specifications to suppliers for our purchases. Our systems are designed to protect the safety and quality of our food supply throughout the procurement and preparation process. Within each store, the Kitchen Manager is primarily responsible for ensuring the timely and correct preparation of food products per the recipes we specify. We provide each of our stores with various tools and training to facilitate these activities. 
Foreign Operations 
 We own and operate two stores outside of the United States in the Canadian province of Ontario. These stores generated revenues of approximately $2.9 million, $18.6 million, and $18.8 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 0.7%, 1.4%, and 1.5%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. As of January 31, 2021, less than 2.0% of our long-lived assets were located outside of the United States. 
 The foreign activities of these stores are subject to various risks of doing business in a foreign country, including currency fluctuations, changes in laws and regulations and economic and political stability. We do not believe there is any material risk associated with the Canadian operations or any dependence by the domestic business upon the Canadian operations.

  Store-Level Quarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality 
 Our revenues are influenced by seasonal shifts in consumer spending. Typically, we have higher revenues associated with the spring and year-end holidays, which will continue to be susceptible to the impact of severe or unseasonably mild weather on customer traffic and sales during that period. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to other quarters. During fiscal 2020, results also fluctuated due to the timing and frequency of temporary closures and operating restrictions as a result of state and local guidelines imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Suppliers 
 The principal goods used by us are redemption game prizes and food and beverage products, which are available from a number of suppliers. We currently purchase a significant amount of our amusement merchandise through a direct import program, a program in which we purchase WIN! merchandise and certain glassware, plate ware and furniture directly from offshore manufacturers. We are a large buyer of traditional and amusement games and as a result believe we receive discounted pricing arrangements. Federal and state health care mandates and mandated increases in the minimum wage and other macro-economic pressures could have the repercussion of increasing expenses, as suppliers may be adversely impacted and seek to pass on higher costs to us. 
Intellectual Property 
 We have registered the trademarks Dave & Buster’s®, Power Card®, Eat & Play Combo®, Eat Drink Play®, and Eat Drink Play Watch®, and have registered or applied to register certain additional trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in various foreign countries. We consider our tradename and our logo to be important features of our operations and seek to actively monitor and protect our interest in this property in the various jurisdictions where we operate. We also have certain trade secrets, such as our recipes, processes, proprietary information and certain software programs that we protect by requiring all of our employees to sign a code of ethics, which includes an agreement to keep trade secrets confidential. 
Government Regulation 
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws affecting our business. For a discussion of the risks and potential impact on our business of a failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Each of our stores is subject to permitting and licensing requirements and regulations by a number of government authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, sanitation, environmental, labor and zoning. The development and construction of new stores is subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, fair trade practices, and the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are also subject to federal, state and local laws that govern health benefits, employment practices and working conditions, including minimum wage rates, wage and hour practices, gratuities, overtime, various family leave mandates, discrimination and harassment, immigration, workplace safety and other areas. In California, we are subject to the Private Attorneys General Act, which authorizes employees to file lawsuits to recover civil penalties on behalf of themselves, other employees, and the State of California for labor code violations. We must comply with laws relating to information security, consumer credit protection and fraud, and data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal and health information.
