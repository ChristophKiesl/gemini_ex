ITEM 1. Business.
Company Overview
We believe we are the leading family entertainment and dining company globally, focused on providing an exciting, fun-filled play and food experience for children and parents alike. Founded in 1977, we have an over 40-year track record and today, have a global network of family entertainment and dining centers (also referred to as “venues”) that we develop, operate and franchise under the names “Chuck E. Cheese” (“Where A Kid Can Be A Kid”) and “Peter Piper Pizza”(“Pizza Made Fresh, Families Made Happy”). Our venues deliver a lively, kid-friendly atmosphere and feature a broad array of entertainment offerings including arcade-style and skill-oriented games, rides, live entertainment shows, with the opportunity for our guests to win tickets and redeem prizes such as toys. plush dolls, and branded merchandise. We combine this memorable entertainment experience with a broad and creative menu that combines kid-friendly classics with a selection of more sophisticated options for adults. We offer families a highly compelling value proposition, where a family can visit Chuck E. Cheese and spend only $39 for a package that includes food, drinks and entertainment, which we believe to be significantly lower than comparable offerings at other dining and entertainment alternatives. We believe there is consistent demand for wholesome entertainment and family dining, and that our combination of entertainment and dining with a strong value proposition creates a highly differentiated experience that appeals to our diverse guest base. We are the venue of choice for many special occasions, and we position Chuck E. Cheese as the #1 brand for kids’ birthdays. With our over 40-year track record of providing family entertainment and dining, our brand recognition and the familiarity of the Chuck E. Cheese character and our related intellectual property provide us with an important competitive advantage as an entertainment provider.
As of December 29, 2019, across both our Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza brands, we operated 555 venues and had 186 venues operating under franchise arrangements, for a system-wide total of 741 venues across 47 states and 16 foreign countries and territories. This significant geographic scale makes us an accessible choice in many neighborhoods across the U.S. and globally. 
In Fiscal 2019, we generated $912.9 million in revenue, $28.9 million of net loss and $184.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA. Notably, we enjoy a balanced sales mix between Entertainment and Merchandise, which during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, accounted for 56% of our Company-operated venue sales and had a gross profit margin of 92%, and food and beverage which accounted for 44% of our Company-operated venue sales and had a gross profit margin of 77% over the same period, resulting in a gross profit margin of 86% for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. See Item 6. “Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information about Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations” for additional information about gross profit margin.
We have developed our iconic Chuck E. Cheese brand with broad appeal through our more than 40-year commitment to being a family-fun and entertainment company. Over the last few years, we have invested in revitalizing our guest experience, including revamping our menu with improved food quality and new offerings, tailoring our marketing message to focus on both kids and moms, improving venue amenities such as adding WI-FI across all locations, and reinvigorating our culture with a new hospitality-oriented training program for our venue staff. We have made corresponding investments in technology, staff training, and our physical assets including labor and inventory management systems. We believe these significant investments position our Company for sustained growth in the future. In 2018, we completed the roll-out of our proprietary Play Pass card system at all Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese venues, which we funded through a capital investment of $56 million from 2015 to 2017. This system replaces the traditional token-based game system used for the last 40 years with an RFID tag that guests use to activate games. Guests can purchase “points” or time on reloadable cards and can use these cards to play our games. Additionally, Play Pass provides us access to significant guest data, which allows us to develop insights into our business and enables us to be more innovative with our game pricing initiatives, such as variable pricing by geographical location and time of day and dynamic pricing on select weekends, spring breaks and holidays. In the third quarter of 2018 we launched All You Can Play (“AYCP”), a first-of-its-kind gaming experience that allows kids access to play every game at Chuck E. Cheese as many times as they want within the specified period of time purchased, on any day, without any restrictions, in all of our domestic Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese venues. For kids, this alleviates concerns of running out of tokens / points, and for adults it provides surety around activity time and increases perceived value. We also launched our “More Tickets” program in the third quarter of 2018, increasing average tickets earned per game play, to drive higher guest satisfaction. In 2019, we expanded the available options under our “More Tickets” program and optimized pricing on our menu items and game packages. These initiatives, combined with the completion of 82 venue remodels under our domestic venue

redesign program, have created positive momentum in our comparable venue sales performance, are driving higher margin entertainment and merchandise spending and we believe position our Company for sustained long-term growth in the future.
 Our Complementary Brands
We believe our two brands, Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza, are complementary, with each offering guests a pizza-anchored menu as well as entertainment. While Chuck E. Cheese focuses principally on kids, Peter Piper Pizza operates smaller venues with a primary emphasis on food, resulting in a higher frequency of visits. With this approach, Peter Piper Pizza is not only popular with families, but also attracts a guest base that includes many adults without children. In addition to everyday visits for the excellent food, adults without families are common customers for the day-time buffet on their weekday lunch break and frequently choose Peter Piper Pizza's carryout option, which can also be ordered online. Also, guests may choose Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza delivery options through third party providers. Although these brands are complementary in many ways and have operations that are substantially similar, we believe they are distinct concepts that do not directly compete.
Chuck E. Cheese: Where A Kid Can Be A Kid. Chuck E. Cheese was founded in 1977 and is a highly recognized brand that uniquely appeals to our primary guest base of families with children between 2 and 12 years of age. Chuck E. Cheese venues feature an open and bright setting, which creates an inviting atmosphere for kids and a good line of sight for parents. Safety is a key focus, including our Kid Check safety system, which provides everyone in a group with a unique number stamp that is checked at the door. Each venue includes approximately 75 games, rides and attractions for kids of all ages, including classic skill games, such as arcade basketball, skee-ball and Whack-a-Mole, along with the Ticket Blaster machine where birthday guests can grab as many tickets as possible in 30 seconds. Our menu features fresh, hand-made pizza, boneless and bone-in chicken wings, desserts and beverages, including beer and wine at most locations. Chuck E. Cheese, our iconic, energetic mouse mascot, performs music and dance shows and interacts with our guests, driving strong brand recognition. We position Chuck E. Cheese as the #1 brand for kids’ birthdays, and reserved birthday packages represented approximately 16% of Chuck E. Cheese venue revenues in Fiscal 2019. As of December 29, 2019, there were 612 Chuck E. Cheese locations in 47 states and 15 foreign countries and territories, of which 515 were Company-operated.
Peter Piper Pizza: Pizza Made Fresh, Families Made Happy. Peter Piper Pizza serves fresh, high-quality handcrafted food and beverages, including craft beer and wine, and offers state-of-the-art games for all ages. Venues feature a bold design and contemporary layout, with open kitchens revealing much of the handcrafted food preparation, such as fresh mozzarella being shredded off the block, vegetables being hand-chopped, wings being hand-tossed and our Certified Dough Masters crafting pizzas with made-from-scratch dough. Our large, open dining areas provide an enjoyable atmosphere for families and group events, with attentive staff dedicated to providing an enjoyable and memorable experience to each guest. As of December 29, 2019, there were 129 Peter Piper Pizza locations in the United States (also referred to as “U.S.”) and Mexico, of which 40 are Company-operated locations. All of Peter Piper Pizza’s Company-operated venues are located in the United States.
Our Company has benefited from the 2014 acquisition of Peter Piper Pizza through the implementation of best practice sharing, and synergies from the leveraging of back office functions and procurement spend. Peter Piper Pizza has also benefited from lower game buying costs under CEC Entertainment's ownership, as Chuck E. Cheese is one of the largest purchasers of arcade games in the United States. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We attribute our success in large part to our (i) iconic, widely recognized brand, (ii) our unique and differentiated family fun and entertainment experience, (iii) our highly compelling consumer value proposition, (iv) our diversified and resilient business model, (v) our consistent demand throughout all cycles, and (vi) our proven and experienced management team. Our venues are unique in that we combine a wholesome family dining offering with distinctive family-oriented games, rides, activities, shows and other entertainment alternatives, all under one roof and within convenient driving distance from our guests’ homes. Many of our high quality entertainment offerings, including all of our live and interactive shows in Chuck E. Cheese venues, guest Wi-Fi in all our venues, and live television in our Peter Piper Pizza venues, can be experienced free of charge. We believe that we benefit from strong and consistent demand for our entertainment offerings from families who desire high quality, safe, clean, convenient and affordable ways to spend time with their children outside of the home. Our executive management team has significant experience in the leisure, hospitality, entertainment and family dining industries and has significant expertise in operating complex, themed family entertainment businesses.

Our Strategic Plan
Our strategic objectives are focused on becoming “the world’s leading family friendly entertainment restaurant brands” by entertaining and inspiring kids around the world and ensuring that every guest is happy. This strategic plan is centered on the following six growth pillars: 
 (i) increase traffic to our venues through marketing and sales promotions; 
 (ii) drive in-store guest spending;
(iii) pursue a programmatic approach to our domestic remodel program; 
(iv) expand the global franchise network; 
 (v) launch a division to focus on entertainment & licensing efforts; and 
(vi) increase efficiencies and lower operating costs with tight controls.
Increase traffic to our venues through marketing and sales programming. Our plan is to increase traffic from repeat visitation and new customers with strategic advertising, new promotional event platforms, and sales initiatives. We have broadened our advertising efforts from a traditional focus on children via television to a broader approach that includes targeted consumer offers and consumer promotional opportunities. We will get to know our consumers better and gain insights to motivate our guests to make one more visit, and build a consistent entertainment proposition for our guests. In addition, we will be expanding our field marketing support team focused on group outings and fundraising.
Drive in-store guest spending. Our strategic initiatives to drive profitability in our venues across the portfolio of guest spending areas include our ability to optimize pricing and promotions in our venues and create better value propositions for our guests through new revenue and upsell opportunities. Our recent and ongoing initiatives to improve the in-venue experience include streamlining the order and checkout process, enhancing our game offerings and improving our birthday program and packages. During 2019, we began testing guest promotions that included unlimited play discount holiday passes, dynamic pricing on select weekends, spring breaks and holidays, and traffic-driving deals such as discounted AYCP.
We also believe that AYCP, a product that allows guests the option to play unlimited games within a specified period of time, is perceived as a greater value proposition for our guests than our Play Pass offering, as evidenced during our testing by higher NPS scores in venues, with 66% positive guest comments on price in AYCP venues versus 44% in non-AYCP venues. For the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, AYCP accounted for approximately 63% of our entertainment revenues. 
Domestic Remodel Program: We are focused on building a long-term brand revitalization program by updating the Chuck E. Cheese brand and considering all revenue generating and operational efficiency opportunities. In 2017, we began testing a redesigned concept at our Chuck E. Cheese venues which carefully targeted areas to improve family experience and comfort. Changes include a new exterior and signage, brighter interiors, art décor on the walls, digital menu boards, a new star dance stage, and a refreshed game offering.
Following an initial test of seven remodels in 2017, we completed 25 remodels in 2018 and an additional 50 remodels in 2019. In 2020, we expect to complete an additional 40 remodels, with an ongoing strategy of completing 40-50 venue remodels each year, at a lower overall cost than earlier remodels. Our current model will maintain the most important elements of the redesign, while eliminating some of the less critical design elements. The venues remodeled in 2017 and 2018 have experienced a sustained comparable store sales uplift of approximately 12% versus un-remodeled venues. Our business model benefits from substantial operating leverage, and we expect in excess of 50% of this increase in sales to flow through to operating income.
We expect to realize a cash-on-cash return of greater than 20% on these remodels. We define and calculate cash-on-cash returns for an individual store as (a) the increase in Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, excluding pre-opening expenses, national marketing expense allocation, non-cash charges related to asset disposals and changes in non-cash deferred amusement revenue and ticket liability, divided by (b) our net development costs for the remodel. Net development costs include equipment, building, leaseholds and site costs, net of tenant improvement allowances and other landlord concessions or payments, excluding pre-opening costs and capitalized interest.
Global Franchise Expansion. We have a long track record of successful new venue development and will continue to pursue a disciplined venue growth strategy in both new and existing markets where we can achieve strong returns and long term success. For new venue openings, we follow a rigorous due diligence and site selection process and strategically locate our venues within convenient driving distance to large metropolitan areas. We will be adding new resources to our local and global franchise departments to explore and identify new and diverse markets to expand the CEC brand with multiple franchise units in areas with high concentration of middle class and family growth around the globe.

As of December 29, 2019, we had 103 international venues operating under franchise arrangements. We aim to continue growing internationally with existing and new franchise partners, with development agreements in place for 79 additional committed Chuck E. Cheese franchise venues across 14 countries and territories. In 2019, we opened 14 new venues collectively in eight countries, with two new Peter Piper Pizza venues in the United States and 12 new franchised Chuck E. Cheese venues in seven other countries. In Fiscal 2020, we expect 16 new Chuck E. Cheese franchised venues to open internationally. 
See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Expenditures” for more information regarding our capital initiatives and expenditures.
CEC Entertainment and Licensing Efforts. We will launch a division that will focus on global entertainment & media networks within CEC and the value creation of Chuck E. Cheese & Friends intellectual property (“IP”) in licensing and in-restaurant guest traffic. Utilizing its tremendous reach to young parents and children, CEC will formalize its in-store, online and digital assets for consumer brands to advertise on these channels with wholesome, approved commercial content. Additionally, the research states, and we believe, that the Chuck E. Cheese and friends IP is one of the most popular character sets in North America and we will develop focused sales and management support to help develop the licensing benefits in media, toys, games and other areas.
Generate Efficiencies and Lower Operating Costs: Our business model benefits from substantial operating leverage, enabling us to drive margin improvement. We continuously focus on delivering financial performance through expense rationalization across all of our venues and functions. We believe that the deployment of best corporate practices across each of our brands and our corporate functions will yield continued margin improvement. Our general managers at our venues and our corporate management staff typically have revenue, profit and customer satisfaction incentives, which foster a strict focus on both providing a high-quality experience for our guests and expense control. Additionally, we have implemented several new technology investments over the past three years that we believe drive continued cost savings. These investments include our enhanced labor management tool, a system-wide upgrade of our point-of-sale terminals and an improved venue inventory management system that provides additional visibility into food cost measurements and automates our replenishment cycles. These initiatives have generated cost efficiencies in a number of key areas, including labor, supplies, food and general and administrative expenses, and we expect these cost efficiencies to continue in the future.
Overview of Operations
Food and Beverage
Each Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza venue offers a variety of pizzas, wings, appetizers, salads and desserts, along with certain gluten-free options. Our hand-made pizza and prepared foods are made fresh to order. Soft drinks, coffee and tea are also served, along with, at most locations, beer and wine. Alcoholic beverages are limited to a maximum of two drinks per guest. Peter Piper Pizza venues also offer lunch buffet options with unlimited pizza, salad, breadsticks and dessert. We continuously focus on delivering a quality-driven product and believe the quality of our food compares favorably with that of our competitors. As part of our ongoing initiatives to improve operations, we have implemented an improved venue inventory management system that provides additional visibility into food cost measurements and automates our replenishment cycles.
Food and beverage sales represented 43.9%, 45.3% and 47.3% of our Company-operated venue sales during Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
Entertainment and Merchandise
Each of our Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza venues has a game room area, which includes an array of amusement and entertainment options. These options range from classic arcade, redemption and skill-oriented games, such as air hockey, skee-ball and basketball, to rides, such as mini trains, motorcycles and various driving games. At Chuck E. Cheese, we also offer musical and comical entertainment that features our iconic Chuck E. Cheese character with live performances and frequent appearances on our showroom and game room floor, along with ongoing entertainment featuring music videos and televised skits. Each Peter Piper Pizza venue also offers flat-screen televisions located throughout the dining area. In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the implementation of Play Pass, a new proprietary game card system, in all of our Chuck E. Cheese Company-operated venues. Play Pass is similar to a stored value gift card and allows guests to activate games and rides with their own personal card. In addition, in July 2018 we launched AYCP in all of our domestic Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese venues. AYCP, a time based play option, allows guests to play unlimited games within a block of time, increasing the number of games, tickets and prizes. More Tickets provides the thrill of winning a greater number of tickets on redemption games. A number of games dispense tickets that can be redeemed by guests for prize merchandise such as toys and plush items. Our guests can also purchase this merchandise directly for cash.

Entertainment and merchandise sales represented 56.1%, 54.7% and 52.7% of our Company-operated venue sales during Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
Franchising 
As of December 29, 2019, we franchised a total of 97 Chuck E. Cheese venues, with 22 venues located in the United States and 75 venues located in 15 foreign countries and territories, and a total of 89 Peter Piper Pizza venues, with 61 venues located in the United States and 28 venues located in Mexico. We have 18 active development and franchise agreements to open 79 Chuck E. Cheese venues in 14 countries and territories, and four signed development and franchise agreements with rights to open another 19 Peter Piper Pizza venues in Texas and one signed development and franchise agreement with rights to open another four venues in Mexico. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the risks associated with franchise development agreements.
Our standard franchise agreements grant the franchisee the right to construct and operate a venue and use our associated trade names, trademarks and service marks in accordance with our standards and guidelines. Most of our existing Chuck E. Cheese’s franchise agreements have an initial term of 15 to 20 years and include a 10-year renewal option. Peter Piper Pizza’s franchise agreements are for a 10-year term and include a 10-year successor agreement on Peter Piper Pizza’s then standard form of agreement. The standard franchise agreement provides us with a right of first refusal should a franchisee decide to sell a venue. We also enter into area development agreements, which grant franchisees exclusive rights to open a specified number of venues in a designated geographic area within a specified period of time. In addition to initial franchise and area development fees, the franchisee is charged a continuing monthly royalty fee equal to a percentage of its gross monthly sales, generally around 6%, which varies by location and brand.
In 1985, we and our Chuck E. Cheese franchisees formed the International Association of CEC Entertainment, Inc. (the “Association”) to discuss and consider matters of common interest relating to the operation of Company-operated and franchised Chuck E. Cheese venues. Routine business matters of the Association are conducted by a board of directors, composed of five members appointed by us and five members elected by the franchisees. The Association serves as an advisory council that, among other responsibilities, oversees expenditures, including (a) the costs of development, purchasing and placement of advertising programs, including websites; (b) the costs to develop and improve audio-visual and animated entertainment attractions, as well as the development and implementation of new entertainment concepts; and (c) the purchase of national network television advertising.
The franchise agreements governing existing franchised Chuck E. Cheese venues in the United States currently require each franchisee to pay to the Association a monthly contribution equal to a certain percentage of its gross monthly sales. Additionally, under these franchise agreements, we are required, with respect to Chuck E. Cheese Company-operated venues, to contribute at the same rates, or at higher rates in certain instances, as our franchisees. We and our franchisees are also required to spend minimum amounts on local advertising and could be required to make additional contributions to fund any deficits that may be incurred by the Association. Certain franchise agreements governing existing franchised Chuck E. Cheese venues outside of the United States currently require the franchisee to pay a certain percentage of their gross monthly sales to the Association to fund various advertising, media, and entertainment costs.
We do not currently have any advertising co-ops or a franchise advisory council with our Peter Piper Pizza franchisees, but we reserve the right to require the formation, merger or dissolution of either or both. Franchisees are required to contribute (a) 5% of weekly gross sales to be used to develop, produce, distribute and administer specific advertising, public relations and promotional programs that promote the services offered by system franchisees; and (b) 0.5% of weekly gross sales to be used to research, develop, produce, and support creative ideas and materials for use in commercial advertisements, public relations, and promotional campaigns in the United States and Mexico. We may elect at any time not to collect or maintain all or any portion of the amount contributed to fund advertising related programs and activities and, during such time that we have made such election, the monies not collected must be expended by the franchisees in their own markets. In addition, we are required, with respect to Company-operated Peter Piper Pizza venues, to contribute funds on the same basis as our franchisees.
Royalties, franchise and area development fees and other miscellaneous franchise income represented 2.5%, 2.3% and 2.0% of our total consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
Foreign Operations
As of December 29, 2019, we operated a total of ten Company-operated venues in Canada. Our Canadian venues generated total revenues of $15.2 million, $15.8 million, and $16.6 million during the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019, December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, representing 1.7%, 1.8% and 1.9% of our total consolidated revenues, respectively. All other international venues are franchised.

These foreign activities, along with our international franchisees, are subject to various risks of conducting business in a foreign country, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, laws and regulations and economic and political stability. See “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the risks associated with operations located in foreign markets.
Third-Party Suppliers
We use a network of 15 distribution centers operated by a single company to distribute most of the food products and supplies used in our domestic Chuck E. Cheese branded venues, five distribution centers for our Canadian Chuck E. Cheese branded venues, and four distribution centers for our Peter Piper Pizza branded venues. We believe that alternative third-party distributors are available for our products and supplies, but we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace our distributors or obtain the necessary products and supplies from other suppliers.
We have not entered into any hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility; however, we typically enter into short-term purchasing arrangements, which may contain pricing designed to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations.
We procure games, rides and other entertainment-related equipment from a limited number of suppliers, some of which are located in China. The number of suppliers from which we purchase games, rides and other entertainment-related equipment, redemption prizes and merchandise has declined due to industry consolidation over the past several years. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the risks associated with our third-party suppliers.
Competition
The family dining and entertainment industries are highly competitive, with a number of major national and regional chains operating in each of these markets. In this regard, we compete for customers on the basis of (a) our name recognition; (b) the price, quality, variety, and perceived value of our food and entertainment offerings; (c) the quality of our customer service; and (d) the convenience and attractiveness of our venues. Although there are other concepts that presently utilize the combined family dining and entertainment format, these competitors primarily operate on a regional or market-by-market basis. To a lesser extent, we also compete directly and/or indirectly with other dining and entertainment formats, including full-service and quick-service restaurants appealing to families with young children, the quick service pizza segment, movie theaters, themed amusement attractions, and other entertainment facilities for children.
Intellectual Property
We own various trademarks and proprietary rights, including Chuck E. Cheese®, Where A Kid Can Be A Kid®, Peter Piper Pizza® and the Chuck E. Cheese character image used in connection with our business, which have been registered with the appropriate patent and trademark offices. The duration of such trademarks is unlimited, subject to continued use and renewal. We believe that we hold the necessary rights for protection of the trademarks considered essential to conduct our business. We believe our trade names and our ownership of trademarks and proprietary rights in the names and character likenesses featured in the operation of our venues provide us with an important competitive advantage, and we actively seek to protect our interests in such property. As discussed earlier under “Our Strategic Plan”, we believe there is an opportunity to leverage our intellectual property into additional revenue and licensing opportunities.
Seasonality
Our operating results fluctuate seasonally. We typically generate our highest sales volumes during the first quarter of each fiscal year due to the timing of school vacations, holidays and changing weather conditions. School operating schedules, holidays and weather conditions may also affect our sales volumes in some operating regions differently than others. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for our full fiscal year.
Government Regulation
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the development and operation of Chuck E. Cheese’s and Peter Piper Pizza venues. For a discussion of government regulation risks to our business, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
10

Employees
As of December 29, 2019, we employed approximately 16,400 employees, including approximately 16,000 in the operation of our Company-operated venues and approximately 400 in our corporate offices. Our employees do not belong to any union or collective bargaining group. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our venues.
Each Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza venue typically employs a general manager, senior assistant manager, one or more assistant managers, an electronics specialist who is responsible for repair and maintenance of the show, games and rides, and approximately 25 to 45 food preparation and service employees, many of whom work part-time. Our staffing requirements are seasonal, and the number of people we employ at our venues will fluctuate throughout the year.
