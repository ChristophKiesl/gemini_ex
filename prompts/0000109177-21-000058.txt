General Overview
We are a diversified global branded consumer products and home essentials company.  We manage the business in three vertically integrated, product focused segments: (i) Home and Personal Care (“HPC”), (ii) Global Pet Care (“GPC”), and (iii) Home and Garden (“H&G”).  The Company manufactures, markets and distributes its products globally in the North America (“NA”), Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EMEA”), Latin America (“LATAM”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions through a variety of trade channels, including retailers, wholesalers and distributors. We enjoy strong name recognition in our regions under our various brands and patented technologies across multiple product categories. Global and geographic strategic initiatives and financial objectives are determined at the corporate level. Each segment is responsible for implementing defined strategic initiatives and achieving certain financial objectives and has a president responsible for sales and marketing initiatives and the financial results for all product lines within that segment. The segments are supported through center-led corporate shared service operations consisting of finance and accounting, information technology, legal and human resources, supply chain and commercial operations. The following is an overview of the consolidated business showing net sales by segment and geographic region sold (based upon destination) as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the year ended September 30, 2021.
Our operating performance is influenced by a number of factors including: general economic conditions; foreign exchange fluctuations; trends in consumer markets; consumer confidence and preferences; our overall product line mix, including pricing and gross margin, which vary by product line and geographic market; pricing of certain raw materials and commodities; energy and fuel prices; and our general competitive position, especially as impacted by our competitors’ advertising and promotional activities and pricing strategies. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Item 7 to this Annual Report, for further discussion of the consolidated operating results and segment operating results.
On September 8, 2021, SBI entered into a definitive Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement with ASSA ABLOY AB to sell the Company's Hardware and Home Improvement ("HHI") segment. As a result, the Company's assets and liabilities associated with the HHI segment have been classified as held for sale, and the respective operations of the HHI segment classified as discontinued operations and reported separately for all periods presented as the planned disposition represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results.
Home and Personal Care (HPC)
The following is an overview of net sales by product category and geographic region sold by destination for the year ended September 30, 2021.

Product Category | Products | Brands 
Home Appliances | Small kitchen appliances including toaster ovens, coffeemakers, slow cookers, blenders, hand mixers, grills, food processors, juicers, toasters, irons, kettles, and breadmakers | Black & Decker®, Russell Hobbs®, George Foreman®, Toastmaster®, Juiceman®, Farberware®, and Breadman®
Personal Care | Hair dryers, flat irons and straighteners, rotary and foil electric shavers, personal groomers, mustache and beard trimmers, body groomers, nose and ear trimmers, women's shavers, haircut kits and intense pulsed light hair removal systems | Remington®, LumaBella® 

We have a trademark license agreement (the "License Agreement") with Stanley Black & Decker ("BDC") pursuant to which we license the Black & Decker® brand in North America, Latin America (excluding Brazil) and the Caribbean for four core categories of household appliances: beverage products, food preparation products, garment care products and cooking products through December 31, 2021. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we agree to pay BDC royalties based on a percentage of sales, with minimum annual royalty payments of $15.0 million. The License Agreement also requires us to comply with maximum annual return rates for products. Total revenue under the License Agreement was $400.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. 
As of the date of this report, we are in discussions with BDC to replace the current License Agreement with a new multi-year trademark license agreement, but there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so. In the event that we cannot reach a new agreement, we believe the current License Agreement, provides us until June 30, 2023 to transition out of the BDC brand and prohibits BDC from competing in the four categories for five years after the end of the transition period. BDC has asserted that it believes the transition period and non-competition provisions in the License Agreement are no longer applicable. For additional information please see our Risk Factors set forth in this Annual Report, including the risk factor entitled "We may not be able to adequately establish and protect our intellectual property rights, and the infringement or loss of our intellectual property rights could harm our business."
We own the right to use the Remington® trademark for electric shavers, shaver accessories, grooming products and personal care products; and Remington Arms Company, Inc. (“Remington Arms”) owns the rights to use the trademark for firearms, sporting goods and products for industrial use, including industrial hand tools. The terms of a 1986 agreement between Remington Products, LLC and Remington Arms provides for the shared rights to use the trademark on products which are not considered “principal products of interest” for either company. We retain the trademark for nearly all products which we believe can benefit from the use of the brand name in our distribution channels. 
HPC products are sold primarily to large retailers, online retailers, wholesalers, distributors, warehouse clubs, food and drug chains and specialty trade or retail outlets such as consumer electronics stores, department stores, discounters and other specialty stores. International distribution varies by region and is often executed on a country-by-country basis. Our sales generally are made through the use of individual purchase orders. A significant percentage of our sales are attributable to a limited group of retailer customers, including Walmart and Amazon, which represent approximately 35% of segment sales for the year ended September 30, 2021.

Sales from electric personal care product categories tend to increase during the December holiday season (the Company's fiscal first quarter), while small appliances sales typically increase from July through December primarily due to the increased demand by customers in the late summer for “back-to-school” sales (the Company's fiscal fourth quarter) and in December for the holiday season. Our sales by quarter as a percentage of annual net sales during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:
