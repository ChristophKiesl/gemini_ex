ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Unless otherwise indicated by the context, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Prestige” refer to Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. and our subsidiaries.  Similarly, reference to a year (e.g., “2017”) refers to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year.
We are engaged in the marketing, sales, manufacturing and distribution of well-recognized, brand name, over-the-counter (“OTC”) healthcare and household cleaning products to mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience, and club stores in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets.  We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage.  Our ultimate success is dependent on several factors, including our ability to:

• | Develop and execute effective sales, advertising and marketing programs;


• | Integrate acquired brands;


• | Develop innovative new products;


• | Respond to the technological advances and product introductions of our competitors; and


• | Continue to grow our presence in the United States and international markets.

We conduct our operations in three reportable segments: North American OTC Healthcare, International OTC Healthcare, and Household Cleaning.

Major Brands
Our major brands, set forth in the table below, have strong levels of consumer awareness and retail distribution across all major channels.  These brands accounted for approximately 78.9%, 75.1%, and 70.8% of our net revenues for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, during the period the respective brands were owned by us.

(1) | We have prepared the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with regard to the market position for our brands based in part on data generated by Information Resources, Inc., an independent market research firm (“IRI”). IRI reports total U.S. Multi-Outlet retail sales data in the food, drug, mass merchandise markets (including Walmart), dollar stores (Dollar General, Family Dollar, Fred's), selected warehouse clubs (BJ's and Sam's) and DeCA military commissaries and convenience stores, representing approximately 90% of Prestige Brands' categories for retail sales. 


(2) | “Market segment” is defined by us and is either a standard IRI category or a segment within a standard IRI category and is based on our product offerings and the categories in which we compete.


(3) | Gaviscon is distributed by us in Canada only, and the market information was generated by Nielsen, an independent third party market research firm for the period ending March 4, 2017. Figures represent national, all channel retail sales data in the food, drug, mass merchandise (e.g. Walmart), general merchandise (e.g. Dollarama), and warehouse club stores (e.g. Costco). Data reported for warehouse club and general merchandise is calculated based on home scan panel data, and not direct point of sale data. 


(4) | The brands from our Care Pharmaceuticals Pty. Ltd. subsidiary ("Care Pharma") includes the Fess line of cold/allergy and saline nasal health products, which is the leading saline spray for both adults and children in Australia, and Hydralyte, which is the leading OTC brand in oral rehydration in Australia. Market information was generated by IRI Aztec, an independent market research firm, for the period ending March 19, 2017. 

Our products are sold through multiple channels, including mass merchandisers and drug, food, dollar, convenience, and club stores, which reduces our exposure to any single distribution channel.

We have grown our product portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. We develop our core brands organically by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and providing advertising support. Acquisitions of OTC brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We have acquired well-recognized brands from consumer products and pharmaceutical companies as well as from private equity investors. While certain of these brands have long histories of brand development and investment, we believe that, at the time we acquired them, certain brands were considered “non-core” by their previous owners. As a result, these acquired brands did not benefit from adequate management focus and marketing support during the period prior to their acquisition, which created opportunities for us to achieve our objective of reinvigorating these brands and improving their performance post-acquisition. After adding a brand to our portfolio, we seek to increase its sales, market share and distribution in both existing and new channels through our established retail distribution network.  This is achieved often through increased spending on advertising and promotional support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations and innovative development of brand extensions. Our business, business model, competitive strengths and growth strategy face various risks that are described in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competitive Strengths
Diversified Portfolio of Well-Recognized and Established Consumer Brands
We own and market well-recognized consumer brands, some of which were established over 60 years ago.  Our diverse portfolio of products provides us with multiple sources of growth and minimizes our reliance on any one product or category. We provide significant marketing support to our core brands that is designed to enhance our sales growth and our long-term profitability.  The markets in which we sell our products, however, are highly competitive and include numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers.  
Strong Competitor in Attractive Categories
We compete in product categories that address recurring consumer needs.  We believe we are well positioned in these categories due to the long history and consumer awareness of our brands, our strong market positions, and our low-cost operating model.  
Proven Ability to Develop and Introduce New Products
We focus our marketing and product development efforts on the identification of under-served consumer needs, the design of products that directly address those needs, and the ability to extend our highly recognizable brand names to other products.  As an example of this philosophy, in 2017, we launched Nix Ultra Kit, Compound W Complete Wart Kit, Luden's Green Apple, Chloraseptic Spray - improved flavors, Efferdent Reformulation, Gaviscon Max Relief Berry and Gaviscon Max Relief Peppermint.  In 2016, we launched Clear Eyes Pure Relief for Dry Eyes and Multi Symptom, Nix Ultra Lice Elimination System, Little Remedies Probiotic Plus Electrolytes and Goody's Mixed Fruit Blast and Back and Body Single Dose. Although line extensions and new product introductions are important to the overall growth of a brand, our efforts may reduce sales of existing products within that brand.  
Efficient Operating Model
To gain operating efficiencies, we oversee the production planning and quality control aspects of the manufacturing, warehousing and distribution of our products, while we primarily outsource the operating elements of these functions to well-established third-party providers.  This approach allows us to benefit from their core competencies and maintain a highly variable cost structure, with low overhead, limited working capital requirements, and minimal investment in capital expenditures, as evidenced by the following:

 | GrossMargin % | G&A %To Total Revenues | CapEx %To Total Revenues
2017 | 56.7 | 10.1 | 0.3 
2016 | 57.9 | 9.0 | 0.4 
2015 | 56.8 | 11.4 | 0.9 

In 2017, our gross margin percentage decreased 120 basis points versus 2016, primarily as a result of purchase accounting charges. In 2016, our gross margin percentage was comparable to the prior year with an increase of 110 basis points. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 110 basis points in 2017 versus 2016, primarily as a result of acquisition and integration charges. In 2017, our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues decreased 10 basis points versus 2016.

Management Team with Proven Ability to Acquire, Integrate and Grow Brands
Our business has grown through acquisition, integration and expansion of the many brands we have purchased.  Our management team has significant experience in consumer product marketing, sales, legal and regulatory compliance, product development and customer service.  We seek more experienced personnel to bear the substantial responsibility of brand management and to effectuate our growth strategy.  These managers nurture the brands to allow the brands to grow and evolve.
Growth Strategy
In order to continue to enhance our brands and drive growth, we focus our growth strategy on our core competencies:

• | Effective Marketing and Advertising;


• | Sales Excellence;


• | Extraordinary Customer Service;


• | Innovation and Product Development; and


• | Strategic Acquisitions

We execute this strategy through the following efforts:

• | Investments in Advertising and Promotion

We invest in advertising and promotion to drive the growth of our core brands.  Our marketing strategy is focused primarily on consumer-oriented programs that include targeted coupon programs, media, in-store and digital advertising. While the absolute level of marketing expenditures differs by brand and category, we have often increased the amount of investment in our brands after acquiring them.  Advertising and promotion spend on our top five selling brands was approximately15.0% of the revenues associated with these brands in 2017.  In 2017 and 2016, advertising and promotional spend on the core brands was approximately 16.4% and 15.7%, respectively, of the revenues associated with these brands. In 2017, advertising and promotion spend for the newly acquired Fleet brands was approximately 32.8% of revenues associated with these brands, from the acquisition date of January 26, 2017 through March 31, 2017. 

• | Growing our Categories and Market Share with Innovative New Products

One of our strategies is to broaden the categories in which we participate and increase our share within those categories through ongoing product innovation.  In 2017, we launched Nix Ultra Kit, Compound W Complete Wart Kit, Luden's Green Apple, Chloraseptic Spray - improved flavors, Efferdent Reformulation, Gaviscon Max Relief Berry and Gaviscon Max Relief Peppermint. In 2016, we launched Clear Eyes Pure Relief for Dry Eyes and Multi Symptom, Nix Ultra Lice Elimination System, Little Remedies Probiotic Plus Electrolytes and Goody's Mixed Fruit Blast and Back and Body Single Dose. While there is always a risk that sales of existing products may be reduced by new product introductions, our goal is to grow the overall sales of our brands.

• | Increasing Distribution Across Multiple Channels

Our broad distribution base attempts to ensure that our products are well positioned across all available channels and that we are able to participate in changing consumer retail trends.  In an effort to ensure continued sales growth, we focus on expanding our reliance on direct sales while reducing our reliance on brokers.  

• | Growing Our International Business

International sales beyond the borders of North America represented 8.4%, 7.4% and 8.9% of revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and are primarily from the acquisition of DenTek in 2016, and the acquisition of Hydralyte in 2015.  We have designed and developed both products and packaging for specific international markets and expect that our international revenues will continue to grow. 
A number of our other brands have previously been sold internationally, and we seek to expand the number of brands sold through our existing international distribution network and continue to identify additional distribution partners for further expansion into other international markets.

• | Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions

Acquisitions are an important part of our overall strategy for growing revenue.  We have a history of growth through acquisition (see "Our History and Accomplishments" below). While we believe that there will continue to be a pipeline of acquisition candidates for us to investigate, strategic fit and relative cost are of the utmost importance in our decision to pursue such opportunities.  We believe our business model allows us to integrate acquisitions in an efficient manner, while also providing opportunities to realize significant cost savings. 
Market Position
During 2017, approximately 75.5% of our net revenues were from brands with a number one or number two market position, compared with approximately 72.1% and 73.0% during 2016 and 2015, respectively.  These brands included Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Compound W, Dramamine, Efferdent, BC/Goody's, Beano, Debrox, Gaviscon, Fess, Hydralyte, Monistat, Nix, DenTek, Summer's Eve, Fleet and Comet.
Our History and Accomplishments
Since our formation in 1996, we have added brands to our portfolio principally by acquiring strong and well-recognized brands from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies.  We engaged in strategic mergers and acquisitions over the last three years as follows:
2017 Acquisition
Acquisition of Fleet
On January 26, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of C.B. Fleet Company, Inc. ("Fleet") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 22, 2016, for $823.7 million. The purchase price was funded by available cash on hand, additional borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the "2012 ABL Revolver"), and a new $740.0 million senior secured incremental term loan (the "2012 Term Loan"). As a result of the merger, we acquired multiple women's health, gastrointestinal and dermatological care OTC brands, including Summer’s Eve, Fleet, and Boudreaux's Butt Paste, as well as a “mix and fill” manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, Virginia. The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with Business Combinations topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The financial results from the Fleet acquisition are included in the Company's North American and International OTC Healthcare segments.
2017 Divestitures
The Company entered into an agreement on June 29, 2016 to sell Pediacare, New Skin and Fiber Choice, which were reported under the North American OTC Healthcare segment in the Cough & Cold, Dermatologicals and Gastrointestinal product groups, respectively.
On July 7, 2016, we completed the sale of the Pediacare, New Skin and Fiber Choice brands for $40.0 million plus the cost of inventory. As a result, we received approximately $40.1 million including the cost of inventory of $2.6 million, less certain immaterial holdbacks, which will be paid upon meeting certain criteria as defined in the asset purchase agreement and within approximately 18 months following the closing date of the transaction. During the year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $56.2 million. The proceeds were used to repay debt and related income taxes due on the dispositions.
Concurrent with the completion of the sale of these brands, we entered into a transitional services agreement with the buyer, whereby we agreed to provide the buyer with various services, including marketing, operations, finance and other services, from the date of the acquisition through January 7, 2017. We also entered into an option agreement with the buyer to purchase Dermoplast at a specified earnings multiple as defined in the option agreement. The buyer paid a $1.25 million deposit for this option in September 2016 and later notified us of its election to exercise the option. 
In December 2016, we completed the sales of the Dermpolast and e.p.t brands for an aggregate amount of $59.6 million. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax net gain on these divestitures of $3.6 million which is included within loss on divestitures on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
 6

 We had licensed to an international consumer packaged goods company (the "licensee") the right to use the Comet, Spic and Span and Chlorinol® trademarks in the commercial/institutional/industrial business throughout the world (excluding Russia and specified Eastern European countries).  We had also transferred to the licensee the Comet and Chlorinol trademarks in Russia and specified Eastern European countries. These agreements were amended in December 2014 to allow the licensee to obtain the trademarks in certain specified Eastern European countries for $10.0 million. The amended agreement was set to expire December 31, 2025, and included an option for the licensee to buy out the remaining commercial/institutional/industrial business at any time after July 1, 2016. The licensee elected to exercise this option and, in August 2016, we received $11.0 million for the purchase of the remaining license rights. Furthermore, the licensee is no longer required to make additional royalty payments to us, and as a result, our future royalty income will be reduced accordingly. 
2016 Acquisition
Acquisition of DenTek
On February 5, 2016, we completed the acquisition of DenTek Holdings, Inc. ("DenTek"), a privately-held marketer and distributor of specialty oral care products. The closing was finalized pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, announced November 23, 2015, under which we agreed to acquire DenTek from its stockholders for a purchase price of $226.9 million. The acquisition expanded our portfolio of brands, strengthened our existing oral care platform and increased our geographic reach in parts of Europe. We financed the transaction with a combination of available cash on hand, available cash from our 2012 ABL Revolver, and financing of an additional unsecured bridge loan. This acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The DenTek brands are included in our North American and International OTC Healthcare segments.
2015 Acquisitions
Acquisition of Insight Pharmaceuticals 
On September 3, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Insight Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("Insight"), a marketer and distributor of feminine care and other OTC healthcare products, for $745.9 million in cash after receiving a return of approximately $7.2 million from escrow. The closing followed the Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) approval of the acquisition and was finalized pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement announced on April 25, 2014. Pursuant to the Insight purchase agreement, we acquired 27 OTC brands sold in North America (including related trademarks, contracts and inventory), which extended our portfolio of OTC brands to include a leading feminine care platform in the United States and Canada anchored by Monistat, the leading North American brand in OTC yeast infection treatment. The acquisition also added brands to the Company's cough & cold, pain relief, ear care and dermatological platforms. In connection with the FTC's approval of the Insight acquisition, we sold one of the competing brands that we acquired from Insight on the same day as the Insight closing. Insight is primarily included in our North American OTC Healthcare segment. The Insight acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition of Hydralyte
On April 30, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Hydralyte brand in Australia and New Zealand from The Hydration Pharmaceuticals Trust of Victoria, Australia, which was funded through a combination of cash on hand and our existing senior secured credit facility. Hydralyte is the leading OTC brand in oral rehydration in Australia and is marketed and sold through Care Pharma. Hydralyte is available in pharmacies in multiple forms and is indicated for oral rehydration following diarrhea, vomiting, fever, heat and other ailments. Hydralyte is included in our International OTC Healthcare segment. The Hydralyte acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.

Debrox is the number one recommended brand with pharmacists in the United States according to Pharmacy Times.
Gaviscon
Gaviscon is currently the number one brand in the $160.0 million Canadian Upset Stomach Remedies category.

For additional information concerning our business segments, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing strategy is based on the acquisition and the rejuvenation of established consumer brands that possess what we believe to be significant brand value and unrealized potential.  Our marketing objective is to increase sales and market share by developing innovative new products and line extensions and executing creative and cost-effective advertising and promotional programs.  After we acquire a brand, we implement a brand building strategy that uses the brand’s existing consumer awareness to maximize sales of current products and provides a vehicle to drive growth through product innovation.  This brand building process involves the evaluation of the existing brand name, the development and introduction of innovative new products, and the execution of support programs.  Recognizing that financial resources are limited, we allocate our resources to focus on our core brands with the most impactful, consumer-relevant initiatives that we believe have the greatest opportunities for growth and financial success.  Brand priorities vary from year-to-year and generally revolve around new product introductions.
Customers 
Our senior management team and dedicated sales force strive to maintain long-standing relationships with our top 50 domestic customers.  We also contract with third-party sales management enterprises that interface directly with our remaining customers and report directly to members of our sales management team.
We enjoy broad distribution across each of the major retail channels, including mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience and club stores.  The following table sets forth the percentage of gross sales across our six major distribution channels during each of the past three years ended March 31:

 | Percentage ofGross Sales(1)
Channel of Distribution | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
Mass | 30.9 | 30.2 | 30.1
Drug | 22.8 | 22.3 | 26.5
Food | 16.5 | 18.0 | 18.4
Dollar | 9.8 | 10.7 | 9.3 
Convenience | 7.0 | 6.6 | 5.7 
Club | 3.0 | 2.7 | 2.0 
Other | 10.0 | 9.5 | 8.0 


(1) | Includes estimates for some of our wholesale customers that service more than one distribution channel.

Due to the diversity of our product lines, we believe that each of these channels is important to our business, and we continue to seek opportunities for growth in each channel.
Our principal customer relationships include Walmart, Walgreens, and CVS. During 2017, 2016, and 2015, Walmart accounted for approximately 21.1%, 20.2%, and 18.1%, respectively, of our gross revenues. We expect that for future periods, our top ten customers, including Walmart, will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of our sales.
Our strong customer relationships and product recognition allow us to attempt to capitalize on a number of important strategic opportunities, including (i) minimization of slotting fees, (ii) maximization of new product introductions, (iii) maximization of shelf space prominence, and (iv) minimization of cash collection days.  We believe that our emphasis on strong customer relationships, speed and flexibility and leading sales technology capabilities, combined with consistent marketing support programs and ongoing product innovation, will continue to maximize our competitiveness in the increasingly complex retail environment.

Outsourcing and Manufacturing
In order to maximize our competitiveness and efficiently allocate our resources, third-party manufacturers fulfill most of our manufacturing needs.  We have found that contract manufacturing often maximizes our flexibility and responsiveness to industry and consumer trends while minimizing the need for capital expenditures.  We select contract manufacturers based on their core competencies and our perception of the best overall value, including factors such as (i) depth of services, (ii) professionalism and integrity of the management team, (iii) manufacturing agility and capacity, (iv) regulatory compliance, and (v) competitive pricing.  We also conduct thorough reviews of each potential manufacturer’s facilities, quality standards, capacity and financial stability.  We generally purchase only finished products from our manufacturers.
Our primary contract manufacturers provide comprehensive services from product development through the manufacturing of finished goods.  They are responsible for such matters as (i) production planning, (ii) product research and development, (iii) procurement, (iv) production, (v) quality testing, and (vi) almost all capital expenditures.  In most instances, we provide our contract manufacturers with guidance in the areas of (i) product development, (ii) performance criteria, (iii) regulatory guidance, (iv) sourcing of packaging materials, and (v) monthly master production schedules.  This management approach results in minimal capital expenditures and maximizes our cash flow, which allows us to reinvest to support our marketing initiatives, fund brand acquisitions or repay outstanding indebtedness.
At March 31, 2017, we had relationships with 113 third-party manufacturers.  Of those, we had long-term contracts with 47 manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately 78.4% of our gross sales for 2017, compared to 55 manufacturers with long-term contracts that accounted for approximately 79.9% of our gross sales in 2016.  The fact that we do not have long-term contracts with certain manufacturers means that we are at risk that they may cease manufacturing our products at any time and for any reason or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases.
At March 31, 2017, suppliers for our key brands included GSK, Denison Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aspen Pharmacare, Olds Products Company, Tower Laboratories Ltd., and Contract Pharmaceuticals Corp. We enter into manufacturing agreements for a majority of our products by sales volume, each of which vary based on the capabilities of the third-party manufacturer and the products being supplied.  These agreements explicitly outline the manufacturer’s obligations and product specifications with respect to the brand or brands being produced.  The purchase price of products is subject to change pursuant to the terms of these agreements due to fluctuations in raw material, packaging and labor costs.  Other products are manufactured on a purchase order basis, which is generally based on batch sizes and results in no long-term obligations or commitments.
In conjunction with the acquisition of Fleet, we acquired a "mix and fill" manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, Virginia, which manufactures products comprising approximately two-thirds of Fleet's sales. Over time, we expect to leverage this facility by expanding production into other products and initiatives.

Warehousing and Distribution
We receive orders from retailers and/or brokers primarily by electronic data interchange, which automatically enters each order into our information systems and then routes the order to our distribution center.  The distribution center will, in turn, send a confirmation that the order was received, fill the order and ship the order to the customer, while sending a shipment confirmation to us.  Upon receipt of the shipment confirmation, we send an invoice to the customer.
We manage product distribution in the continental United States primarily through one facility located in St. Louis, which is owned and operated by a third-party provider.  Our U.S. warehouse provider provides warehouse services including storage, handling and shipping, as well as transportation services, with respect to our full line of products, including (i) complete management services, (ii) claims administration, (iii) proof of delivery, (iv) procurement, (v) report generation, and (vi) automation and freight payment services.
Competition
The business of selling brand name consumer products in the OTC Healthcare and Household Cleaning categories is highly competitive.  These markets include numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers’ business both in the United States and abroad.  In addition, like most companies that market products in these categories, we are experiencing increased competition from “private label” products introduced by major retail chains.  While we believe that our branded products provide superior quality and benefits, we are unable to predict the extent to which consumers will purchase “private label” products as an alternative to branded products. 
Our principal competitors vary by industry category.  Competitors in the OTC Healthcare category include: Johnson & Johnson, maker of Visine®, which competes with our Clear Eyes brand; McNeil-PPC (owned by Johnson & Johnson), maker of Children's Tylenol®, and Novartis Consumer Healthcare, maker of Triaminic®, each of which competes with our Little Remedies brand; The Procter & Gamble Company, maker of Vicks®, Reckitt Benckiser, maker of Cepacol®, and Kraft Foods, maker of Halls®, each of which competes with our Chloraseptic and Luden's brands; and The Procter & Gamble Company, maker of Fixodent®, and GSK, maker of Polident®, each of which competes with our Efferdent brand. Sunstar America, Inc., maker of the GUM® line of oral care products, competes with our DenTek and The Doctor's oral care brands. Top competitors of our acquired GSK Brands categories include: McNeil-PPC (owned by Johnson & Johnson), maker of Tylenol®, Pfizer, maker of Advil®, and Novartis Consumer Healthcare, maker of Excedrin®, each of which competes with our BC, Goody's and Ecotrin brands. Novartis Consumer Healthcare, maker of Gas X®, competes with our Beano brand; and GSK, maker of Tums®, competes with our Gaviscon and Tagamet brands. Competitors of our recently acquired Fleet brands include Combe, maker of Vagisil, Boehringer Ingelheim, maker of DulcoLax, Johnson & Johnson, maker of Desitin, and GlaxoSmithKline, maker of Gas-X.
Competitors in the Household Cleaning category include: Henkel AG & Co., maker of Soft Scrub®, Colgate-Palmolive Company, maker of Ajax® Cleanser, and The Clorox Company, maker of Tilex®, each of which competes with our Comet brand.  Additionally, Clorox’s Pine Sol® and The Procter & Gamble Company’s Mr. Clean® compete with our Spic and Span brand, while 3M Company, maker of Scotch-Brite®, O-Cel-O® and Dobie® brands, and Clorox’s SOS® compete with our Chore Boy brand. 
We compete on the basis of numerous factors, including brand recognition, product quality, performance, value to customers, price, and product availability at the retail level.  Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging, the timing of new product introductions, and line extensions also have a significant impact on customers’ buying decisions and, as a result, on our sales.  The structure and quality of our sales force, as well as sell-through of our products, affect in-store position, wall display space and inventory levels in retail outlets.  Our markets are also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market.  
Many of the competitors noted above are larger and have substantially greater research and development and financial resources than we do, and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively and consistently on research and development, advertising and marketing, and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. See “Competitive Strengths” above for additional information regarding our competitive strengths and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for additional information regarding competition in our industry.
Regulation
Product Regulation
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the FDA, FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries 
 12

in which our products are manufactured, distributed and sold.  Our Regulatory Team is guided by a senior member of management and staffed by individuals with appropriate legal and regulatory experience.  Our Regulatory and Operations teams work closely with our third-party manufacturers and our own manufacturing operation on quality-related matters, while we monitor our third party manufacturers' compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and perform periodic audits to ensure compliance.  This continual evaluation process is designed to ensure that our manufacturing processes and products are of the highest quality and in compliance with known regulatory requirements.  If the FDA or a foreign governmental authority chooses to audit a particular third-party manufacturing facility, we require the third-party manufacturer to notify us immediately and update us on the progress of the audit as it proceeds.  If we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could become subject to significant claims or penalties or be required to discontinue the sale of the non-compliant product. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales.
Most of our U.S. OTC drug products are regulated pursuant to the FDA’s monograph system.  The monographs set out the active ingredients and labeling indications that are permitted for certain broad categories of U.S. OTC drug products.  When the FDA has finalized a particular monograph, it has concluded that a properly labeled product formulation is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded.  A tentative final monograph indicates that the FDA has not made a final determination about products in a category to establish safety and efficacy for a product and its uses.  However, unless there is a serious safety or efficacy issue, the FDA typically will exercise enforcement discretion and permit companies to sell products conforming to a tentative final monograph until the final monograph is published.  Products that comply with either final or tentative final monograph standards do not require pre-market approval from the FDA.
Certain of our U.S. OTC drug products are New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) products and are manufactured and labeled in accordance with a FDA-approved submission. These products are subject to reporting requirements as set forth in FDA regulations.
Certain of our U.S. OTC Healthcare products are medical devices regulated by the FDA through a system which usually involves pre-market clearance.  During the review process, the FDA makes an affirmative determination as to the sufficiency of the label directions, cautions and warnings for the medical devices in question.
Certain of our products are considered cosmetics regulated by the FDA through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). FDA does not require pre-market clearance but seeks to insure the products are not adulterated or misbranded. 
In accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) and FDA regulations, we and our third-party manufacturers of U.S. products must also comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”).  The FDA inspects our facilities and those of our third-party manufacturers periodically to determine that both we and our third-party manufacturers are complying with GMPs.
A number of our products are regulated by the CPSC under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (the “FHSA”), the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (the “PPPA”) and the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (the “CPSIA”).  Certain of our household products are considered to be hazardous substances under the FHSA and therefore require specific cautionary warnings to be included in their labeling for such products to be legally marketed.  In addition, a small number of our products are subject to regulation under the PPPA and can only be legally marketed if they are dispensed in child-resistant packaging or labeled for use in households where there are no children.  The CPSIA requires us to make available to our customers certificates stating that we are in compliance with any applicable regulation administered by the CPSC. 
Nix spray and certain Household Cleaning products are considered pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”).  Generally speaking, any substance intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest is considered to be a pesticide under FIFRA.  We also market and distribute certain household products under our Comet and Spic and Span brands that make antibacterial and/or disinfectant claims governed by FIFRA.  Due to the antibacterial and/or disinfectant claims on certain of the Comet and Spic and Span products and the lice killing claims on Nix spray, such products are considered to be pesticides under FIFRA and are required to be registered with the EPA and contain certain disclosures on the product labels.  In addition, the contract manufacturers from which we source these products must be registered with the EPA.  Our EPA registered products are also subject to state regulations and the rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions where these products are sold.
Our international business is also subject to product regulations by local regulatory authorities in the various regions these businesses operate, including regulations regarding manufacturing, labeling, distribution, sale and storage.

Other Regulations
We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets, including regulations pertaining to import/export regulations and antitrust issues.  To the extent we decide to commence or expand operations in additional countries, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country’s ministry of health or comparable agency.  We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that may vary from country to country.  Government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction, or require the reformulation or withdrawal, of some of our products.  Our failure to comply with these regulations can also result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.  In addition, we are subject to FTC and state regulations, as well as foreign regulations, relating to our product claims and advertising.  If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions and the imposition of penalties. 
Intellectual Property
We own a number of trademark registrations and applications in the United States, Canada and other foreign countries.  The following are some of the most important registered trademarks we own in the United States and/or Canada:  Chloraseptic, Chore Boy, Cinch®, Clear Eyes, Comet, Compound W, Dramamine, Efferdent, Effergrip, Freeze Off, Little Remedies, Luden's, NasalCrom, Spic and Span, The Doctor’s Brushpicks, DenTek, The Doctor’s NightGuard, Wartner, BC, Goody's, Ecotrin, Beano, Gaviscon, Tagamet, Debrox, Gly-Oxide, Monistat, Nix, Fleet, Summer's Eve and Boudreaux's Butt Paste.
Our trademarks and trade names are how we convey that the products we sell are “brand name” products.  Our ownership of these trademarks and trade names is very important to our business, as it allows us to compete based on the value and goodwill associated with these marks.  We may also license others to use these marks.  Additionally, we own or license patents on innovative and proprietary technology.  The patents evidence the unique nature of our products, provide us with exclusivity, and afford us protection from the encroachment of others.  None of the patents that we own or license, however, is material to us on a consolidated basis. Enforcing our rights, or the rights of any of our licensors, represented by these trademarks, trade names and patents is critical to our business and may require significant expense.  If we are not able to effectively enforce our rights, others may be able to dilute our trademarks, trade names and patents and diminish the value associated with our brands and technologies.
We do not own all of the intellectual property rights applicable to our products.  In those cases where our third-party manufacturers own patents that protect our products, we are dependent on them as a source of supply for our products.  Unless other non-infringing technologies are available, we must continue to purchase patented products from our suppliers who sell patented products to us.  In addition, we rely on our suppliers for their enforcement of their intellectual property rights against infringing products.
We previously licensed to an international consumer packaged goods company the right to use the Comet, Spic and Span and Chlorinol® trademarks in the commercial/institutional/industrial business throughout the world (excluding Russia and specified Eastern European countries).  We also transferred to the licensee the Comet and Chlorinol trademarks in Russia and specified Eastern European countries. These agreements were amended in December 2014 to allow the licensee to obtain the trademarks in certain specified Eastern European countries for $10.0 million. The amended agreement was set to expire December 31, 2025, and included an option for the licensee to buy out the remaining commercial/institutional/industrial business at any time after July 1, 2016. The licensee elected to exercise this option and, in August 2016, we received $11.0 million for the purchase of the remaining license rights. Furthermore, the licensee is no longer required to make additional royalty payments to us, and as a result, our future royalty income will be reduced accordingly. 
Seasonality
The first quarter of our fiscal year typically has the lowest level of revenue due to the seasonal nature of certain of our brands relative to the summer and winter months.  In addition, the first quarter generally is the least profitable quarter due to the increased advertising and promotional spending to support those brands with a summer selling season, such as Clear Eyes products, Compound W, and Wartner.  The level of advertising and promotional campaigns in the third quarter influences sales of our cough/cold products, such as Chloraseptic, Little Remedies, and Luden's, during the fourth quarter cough & cold winter months.  Additionally, the fourth quarter typically has the lowest level of advertising and promotional spending as a percent of revenue. 
Employees
We employed approximately 520 full time and 10 part time individuals at March 31, 2017. Of our approximately 530 employees, approximately 340 are non-production employees.  None of our employees is a party to a collective bargaining agreement.  Management believes that our relations with our employees are good.
Backlog Orders
We define backlog as orders with requested delivery dates prior to March 31, 2017 that were not shipped as of March 31, 2017. We had no significant backlog orders at March 31, 2017 or 2016.
