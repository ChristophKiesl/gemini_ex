ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organization
GreenSky, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation on July 12, 2017. The Company was formed for the
purpose of completing an initial public offering ("IPO") of its Class A common stock and certain Reorganization
Transactions, as further described in the GreenSky, Inc. Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") on March 2, 2020 (the "2019 Form 10-K"), in order to carry on the business of GreenSky, LLC (“GSLLC”), a Georgia limited liability Company. GSLLC is an operating entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of GS Holdings, LLC ("GS Holdings"). GS Holdings, a holding company with no operating assets or operations other than its equity interest in GSLLC, was organized in August 2017 to serve as a holding company for GSLLC. The equity of GS Holdings is owned partially by GreenSky, Inc. and partially by certain pre-IPO equity owners of GS Holdings. Common membership interests of GS Holdings are referred to as "Holdco Units." On May 24, 2018, the Company's Class A common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in connection with its IPO. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for a detailed discussion of the Reorganization Transactions, as defined in that footnote, and the IPO.
In 2020, we formed GS Depositor I, LLC (“Depositor”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, and GS Investment I, LLC (the “Warehouse SPV”), a special purpose vehicle and indirect subsidiary of the Company, to facilitate purchases of participation interests in loans (“Warehouse Loan Participations") originated by Bank Partners through the GreenSky program. These purchases are made by Depositor and then transferred to the Warehouse SPV. Each of the Warehouse SPV and Depositor is a separate legal entity from the Company, and the assets of the Warehouse SPV and Depositor are solely available to satisfy the creditors of the Warehouse SPV or Depositor, respectively.
Unless the context requires otherwise, "we," "us," "our," "GreenSky" and "the Company" refer to GreenSky, Inc. and its subsidiaries. "Bank Partners" are the federally insured banks that originate loans under the consumer financing and payments program that we administer for use by merchants on behalf of such banks in connection with which we provide point-of-sale financing and payments technology and related marketing, servicing, collection and other services (the "GreenSky program" or "program").
Company Overview
GreenSky is a leading U.S.-based technology company enabling frictionless promotional financing at the point of sale for a growing ecosystem of merchants, consumers and Bank Partners. Our Company was founded on the idea that payment, credit and commerce could be enhanced using technology delivered via an elegant user experience. We believe payment and credit can be an asset that empowers and enables commerce, not a distraction or impediment. Our mission is to help businesses grow and delight their customers. For specific key developments and results during the year ended December 31, 2020, see "Executive Summary–2020 Developments" and "Executive Summary–2020 Results" in Part II, Item 7.


The way in which we conduct our business is guided by our core values:
Our business model, built upon repeat and growing usage by merchants, allows us to generate recurring revenues with limited customer acquisition and marketing costs, resulting in attractive unit economics and strong margins. We derive most of our revenue and profitability from upfront transaction fees that merchants pay us every time they facilitate a transaction using our platform. Thus, our profitability is strongly correlated with merchant transaction volume. The transaction fee rate depends on the terms of financing underlying the consumer loans. In addition, we receive servicing fees on the loan portfolios we service for our Bank Partners and share, indirectly, in the excess profitability, if any, of the loan portfolios we facilitate for our Bank Partners. Beginning in 2020, we also facilitate sales of participation interests in loans and whole loans originated by our Bank Partners under the GreenSky program. We receive servicing fees on participated loans, where a Bank Partner retains the loan and servicing rights and we service the participated loans for the Bank Partner. Our loan receivables held for sale are loan participations that we purchased, which are primarily expected to be sold to institutional investors, financial institutions and other capital markets investors or to Bank Partners.
We developed and have been advancing and refining our proprietary, purpose-built platform to provide significant benefits to our growing ecosystem of merchants, consumers and Bank Partners. Our platform enables each of these constituents to benefit from enhanced access to each other and to our technology, resulting in a virtuous cycle of increasing engagement and value creation. We believe our ecosystem grows stronger with scale.
Merchants. Merchants using our platform presently range from small, owner-operated home improvement contractors and healthcare providers to large national home improvement brands and retailers and healthcare service organizations. With COVID-19 persisting, the partnership we enjoy with our merchants has never been more important. In order for our merchants to better adapt to their customers' financing needs in the current economic environment, we developed a suite of new promotional loan product offerings, primarily additional reduced rate and deferred interest loan products, based on merchant feedback. The value proposition to merchants leveraging our scalable, proprietary technology platform includes: 
•Increased sales volume. By facilitating reduced rate or deferred interest promotional point-of-sale financing and payments solutions for their customers, merchants enhance their sales volume potential through higher conversion from bid to contract, and increased ticket size.
•Seamless integration. Our platform is designed to provide a seamless experience for our merchants with a mobile-native design that is intuitive, easy to use and integrates effortlessly with merchants’ existing payments systems. We settle payments through a national credit card payment network or through the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) network, meaning merchants that already accept these types of payments require no systems integration to adopt our platform. This frictionless onboarding makes consumer point-of-sale financing available for merchants of all sizes. 
•Agility. We work creatively and collaboratively to design, configure and manage promotional financing offers that fulfill the evolving and competitive needs of our merchants while continuing to improve our solutions to appeal to their customers.
Consumers. Consumers who transact on our platform typically have super-prime or prime credit scores and find financing with promotional terms to be an attractive alternative to other forms of payment, particularly in the case of larger purchases. We provide a completely paperless, mobile-enabled experience that typically permits a consumer to apply and be approved for financing in less than 60 seconds at the point of sale. The value proposition to consumers includes:
•Superior experience. Because we are able to process an application and approve financing at the point of sale with limited burden on the consumer, our platform enables consumers to “apply and buy” in most cases in less than 60 seconds, utilizing an intuitive mobile interface and paperless loan agreement. 
•Promotional interest rates and terms. The majority of the loans facilitated by our platform carry promotional financing with deferred interest or reduced rate terms, an attractive alternative relative to typical financing rates on credit card accounts.
•Enablement of larger purchases. By allowing merchants to market to their customers by focusing on the monthly cost of their purchases rather than the one-time upfront cash outlays, consumers are able to better budget for purchases that are larger than they might otherwise make in the absence of financing.
•Preservation of revolving credit availability. Rather than utilizing revolving credit for large purchases, which results in available credit lines being reduced, the loans we facilitate preserve credit card availability for everyday purchases.
Bank Partners. Bank Partners in our ecosystem have access to our proprietary technology solution and merchant network, enabling them to build a diversified nationwide portfolio of high-quality consumer loans with attractive risk-adjusted yields. Our platform delivers significant loan volume, while requiring minimal upfront investment by our Bank Partners. Furthermore, our program is designed to adhere to the regulatory and compliance standards of our Bank Partners, which has helped us to gain their confidence, allowing them to outsource both loan facilitation and servicing functions to us. The value proposition to our Bank Partners includes:
•Consumer credit exposure at attractive risk-adjusted yields. We believe loans originated on our platform offer strong net interest margin, credit performance and duration characteristics relative to financing institutions' other unsecured consumer lending opportunities.
•Nationally diversified, small-balance loans. While many of our Bank Partners may traditionally focus on lending opportunities within their geographic footprints, our platform enables them to originate loans in all 50 states, with an average loan size of approximately $10,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, thus creating an efficient mechanism to aggregate a granular, diversified national portfolio.
•Access to our proprietary technology and merchant network. Over the past decade, we built and refined our technology platform to deliver significant value to merchants and consumers. We also cultivated strong relationships with "Sponsors" and merchants. "Sponsors" refers to manufacturers, their captive and franchised operations, and trade associations with which we partner to source prospective merchants. We believe our Bank Partners would require significant time and investment to build such a technology solution and merchant network themselves.
•No customer acquisition cost and limited operating expenses. Our platform alleviates the need for our Bank Partners to bear any direct marketing, software development or technology infrastructure costs to originate loans.
•Robust compliance framework. We continuously refine and upgrade our platform, risk management and servicing capabilities to meet the compliance, information security, documentation and vendor management requirements of our Bank Partners and their regulators.
Our Platform
Our platform is powered by a proprietary, patented technology infrastructure that delivers stability, speed, scalability and security. It supports the full transaction lifecycle, including credit application, underwriting, real-time loan allocation to our Bank Partners, document distribution, funding, settlement and servicing, and it can be expanded to additional industry verticals and origination channels as we scale our business. 
We believe our technology platform creates meaningful barriers to entry for other providers attempting to reach the same scale with merchants, consumers and funding partners. These attributes include: 
•Intuitive user interface. We designed our digital platform to be simple and easy to use.
•Paperless application and documentation environment. Our platform populates applications using a mobile device’s location data and a scan of the consumer’s driver license, eliminating unnecessary effort. Once the application is approved, a digital loan agreement is delivered in real time, generally back to the same mobile device. The consumer accepts the terms of the agreement through electronic signature, eliminating the need for a physical signature.
•Capacity to support a wide range of promotional financing solutions. Our technology enables merchants of all sizes and their sales associates to select among several promotional financing solutions based on customer preferences.
•Significant flexibility and processing capabilities. Our technology stack includes an “Application Tier” (multiple user-facing applications) and a dynamic “Database Tier” (real-time algorithmic underwriting and processing functionality, data archiving, lookup and reporting). Together, this results in a comprehensive technology solution that supports the full transaction lifecycle.
•Real-time credit decisions and placement with a Bank Partner. We developed an algorithm that underwrites potential loans against the specified credit criteria of each of our Bank Partners. Once loan applications are underwritten and matched against the Bank Partners’ credit criteria, a proprietary, patented, digital “round-robin” system allocates each unique approved loan to a Bank Partner.
•Automated regulatory compliance. During the underwriting process, our systems instantly check applicants against national databases designed to identify potential fraud, money laundering and other “red flags.”
•Integration into payments network. We settle and fund transactions on a national credit card network or via the ACH system, allowing merchants to adopt our digital platform without any capital expenditure or back-end payment systems integration.
•System of record and loan servicing. Our technology maintains the system of record for the portfolio of each of our Bank Partners, whereby details of all loans initiated, funded and serviced are maintained in a secure, online, user-accessible environment.
•Scalable digital platform. Because each feature of our platform is digitally-enabled, we can efficiently adapt to the changing preferences of our constituents and achieve greater scale.
Enterprise Risk Management
GreenSky operates in a highly regulated industry. In addition, our relationships with our merchants and third-party vendors subject us to a variety of regulatory, financial and reputational risks. The Company developed and implemented a comprehensive compliance management system designed to maintain compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the GreenSky program and to adapt to our evolving business strategy and operations. In addition, we have developed a proprietary complaints management system designed to identify, document and remediate customer complaints promptly and efficiently. Key components of our risk management efforts include the following:
•Merchant Management. Prior to enrollment for participation in the GreenSky program, prospective merchants undergo a rigorous vetting and underwriting process. Thereafter, merchants are subject to continued review through our merchant risk management, compliance management and complaints management programs, and, depending on the results of that review, may be subject to suspension or termination from the GreenSky program. In addition, merchants are required to complete initial compliance and fair lending training and are provided ongoing training materials. Each of these programs is designed to prevent, detect and mitigate financial and reputational risks brought to the GreenSky program by merchants.
•Customer Satisfaction. We deploy multiple communication channels to raise borrower awareness of account activity related to their GreenSky program loan, including welcome emails, account alerts and outbound calls. In addition, we routinely make outbound customer satisfaction calls and send emails to sample populations of borrowers as part of our ongoing merchant reevaluation and review process. This process includes dedicated outbound call campaigns designed to sample borrowers across the program merchant network, with particular focus on certain higher risk groups, such as elderly borrowers. We have a team of GreenSky Customer Advocates who work to resolve borrower dissatisfaction with merchants or the GreenSky program.
•Bank Partners. We engage with bank partners that seek attractive risk-adjusted yields and portfolio diversification through exposure to high quality consumer credit. For the GreenSky program, each of our Bank Partners has directed a proprietary credit policy, which is grounded in proven, established credit performance attributes and is designed to incorporate the credit performance of a full economic cycle. Our proprietary technology platform instantly adjudicates on each application using transparent and verifiable credit criteria and allocates each loan based on the credit guidelines of our Bank Partners.
Intellectual Property, Patents and Trademarks
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and contractors and other parties with whom we conduct business to control use and access to, and limit disclosure of, our proprietary information. In 2014, we submitted a patent application relating to our mobile application process and credit decisioning model; the related patent was issued in July 2020. In 2020, we submitted additional patent applications related to our mobile application process and credit decisioning model; we received a patent related to one of these applications in November 2020. We also submitted a patent application related to our Universal Credit Application platform, which allows participating merchants to seamlessly make available second-look financing to their customers. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States. We also own the domain name rights for "greensky.com," as well as other words and phrases important to our business. 
For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property, see Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Competition
The consumer credit and payments market is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving, subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight and highly competitive. We face competition from a diverse landscape of consumer lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions and credit card issuers, as well as alternative technology-enabled lenders. 
Many of our credit and payment competitors are (or are affiliated with) financial institutions with the capacity to hold loans on their balance sheets, increasing the potential profitability of individual consumer relationships. Some of these competitors offer a broader suite of products and services than we do, including retail banking solutions, credit and debit cards and loyalty programs. 
We compete for merchants based on a number of key product features, including price, simplicity of loan terms, promotional terms, ease of applying, merchant fees, user experience and time-to-funding. Our existing core unsecured term loan products face competition primarily from home equity lines of credit and general-purpose revolving credit cards. Consumers can access these alternatives through a range of traditional and technology-enabled sources. We expect competition to continue to increase as many traditional, large-scale consumer lenders are investing in technology to streamline loan application and funding processes. We also expect to face additional competition from current competitors or others who embrace new technologies to significantly change the consumer credit and payment industry.
Seasonality
Our business is generally subject to seasonality in consumer spending and payment patterns. While these patterns historically observed have been somewhat disrupted by COVID-19, we expect seasonality to continue. Given that our home improvement vertical is our most significant contributor to our overall revenue, our revenue generally is higher during the second and third quarters of the year as the weather improves, the residential real estate market becomes more active and consumers begin home improvement projects. During these periods, we tend to experience increased loan applications and, in turn, transaction volume. Conversely, our revenue generally slows during the first and fourth quarters of the year, as consumer spending on home improvement projects tends to slow leading up to the holiday season and through the winter months. As a result, the volume of loan applications and transactions also tends to slow during these periods. The elective healthcare vertical is susceptible to seasonality during the fourth quarter of the year, as the licensed healthcare providers take more vacation time around the holiday season. During this period, the volume of elective healthcare procedures and our resulting revenue tend to slow relative to other periods throughout the year. Our seasonality trends may vary in the future as we introduce our program to new industry verticals and become less concentrated in the home improvement industry. 
The origination related and finance charge reversal components of our cost of revenue (further discussed in Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8) also are subject to these same seasonal factors, while the servicing related component of cost of revenue, in particular customer service staffing, printing and postage costs, is not as closely correlated to seasonal volume patterns. As transaction volume increases, the transaction volume related personnel costs, as well as costs related to credit and identity verification, among other activities, increase as well. Further, finance charge reversal settlements are positively correlated with transaction volume in the same period of the prior year. As prepayments on deferred interest loans, which trigger finance charge reversals, typically are highest towards the end of the promotional period, and promotional periods are most commonly 12, 18 or 24 months, finance charge reversal settlements typically follow a similar seasonal pattern as transaction volumes over the course of a calendar year. 
Lastly, we have observed seasonal patterns in consumer credit, driven to an extent by income tax refunds, which result in lower charge-offs during the second and third quarters of the year. Credit improvement during these periods has a positive impact on the incentive payments we receive from our Bank Partners. Conversely, during the first and fourth quarters of the year, when credit performance is comparably lower, our incentive payment receipts are negatively impacted, which in turn has a negative impact on our cost of revenue.
Significant Customers
Our top ten merchants (including certain groups of affiliated merchants) accounted for an aggregate of 27% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Home Depot is our most significant single merchant, followed by affiliates of Renewal by Andersen, our largest Sponsor, such affiliates including both Andersen Corporation-owned licensed dealers and approximately 90 independently owned and operated Renewal by Andersen licensed dealers. We expect to have significant concentration in our largest merchant relationships for the foreseeable future. In the event that (i) The Home Depot or one or more of our other significant merchants, or 
groups of merchants, or (ii) Renewal by Andersen or one or more of our other significant Sponsors, and their dealers, terminate their relationships with us, or elect to utilize an alternative source for financing, the number of loans originated through the GreenSky program likely would decline, which would materially adversely affect our business and, in turn, our revenue.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, GreenSky had 1,164 full-time employees, with substantially all employees located in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, Crestview Hills, Kentucky and Mooresville, North Carolina. Our sales force is mainly remote across the country. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
We believe that the success and future growth of our Company depends greatly on our ability to attract, develop and retain top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values. We strive to ensure that GreenSky is a diverse, inclusive and safe environment that fosters creativity and innovation. To succeed in a competitive labor market, we seek to provide our employees with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs.
Health and Safety. The health and safety of our employees and their families is our highest priority and is reflected, most recently, in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in response to which we successfully instituted a company‑wide work‑from‑home program in March 2020 to ensure the safety of all of our employees and their families and implemented an emergency paid-time-off policy that employees can use to help cover time out of work in order to care for themselves or their immediate family members. Our Business Continuity Planning (BCP) Team communicates regularly with employees, provides resources for health, wellness and engagement, and establishes safety protocols for employees continuing critical on-site work.
Diversity and Inclusion. The Company believes that an inclusive and diverse work environment serves the interests of all of our stakeholders, encourages employee acceptance, development and retention, and helps us to exceed customer expectations and meet our growth objectives. We are committed to building a culture that fosters diversity, values inclusion and promotes individuality. Current key initiatives include employee experience, learning and development, talent acquisition, and external relationships. 
Compensation and Benefits. We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering a comprehensive compensation and benefits program to our employees. Salaries and wages paid to our employees are competitive based on position, skill and experience level, knowledge, and geographic location. In addition, we maintain an annual bonus plan, an equity award plan and a 401(k) plan for eligible employees. We also provide, among other benefits, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, a healthcare advocacy service, employer paid disability leave, employer paid life insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, employer paid telehealth, employee assistance programs and tuition assistance.
Training and Talent Development. Our ability to grow and succeed in a highly competitive industry depends on the continued engagement, training and development of our employees. The Company’s talent development programs are designed to provide employees with the resources to help them achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We have a strong value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative working environment and shared sense of purpose to attract talent. We provide a wide variety of opportunities for professional growth for all employees with classroom and online training and on‑the‑job experience and counseling.
