Item 1. Business 
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19, a new respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus, as a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, President Trump declared the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States a national emergency. The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has expanded in recent weeks, and has resulted in stay-at home orders, school closures and widespread business shutdowns across the country. The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant adverse impact and created many uncertainties related to our business, and we expect that it will continue to do so. Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and the fast pace at which new developments relating to the outbreak are occurring, it is difficult to assess or predict the short-term or long-term effects of the outbreak on our financial performance.
 
The COVID-19 outbreak has caused substantial financial market volatility in recent weeks and has significantly adversely affected both the U.S. and the global economy. The extensive shutdowns of businesses, schools, and shops and other reductions in both consumer and industrial business activity across the country and globally have substantially decreased our revenue opportunities and increased financial uncertainty. The outbreak has already resulted in a contraction in U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) for the first quarter of 2020 and could result in a sustained drop in the level of U.S. economic activity which will adversely impact our future growth and revenues. Our future business outlook and expectations are very uncertain due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and are very difficult to quantify. It is difficult to assess or predict the impact of this unprecedented event on our business, financial results or financial condition. Factors that will impact the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak affects our business, financial results and financial condition include: the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak; the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including government actions to mitigate the economic impact of the outbreak; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, including whether any future outbreaks interrupt economic recovery.


Overview
 
Telidyne Inc. ("Telidyne" or the "Company") is a technology platform company offering digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide through its proprietary mobile App payment platform TELI.
 
Telidyne’s mobile payment platform enables our users to send and receive payments. We are also developing a two-sided network where both merchants and consumers can have TELI accounts with a digital wallet balance functionality. Our payment service enables the completion of payments on our Payments Platform on behalf of our mobile App users. We offer our users the flexibility to use their digital wallet account to make payment to each other for goods and services, as well as to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to add funds into their digital wallet safely using a variety of funding sources, including a bank account or a credit or debit card. Our TELI platform also makes it easier for friends and family to transfer funds to each other for peer to peer transfers.
 
Our revenues are earned by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our users and other payment-related services. We do not charge users any fees to fund or withdraw from their digital TELI account; however, we generate revenue from consumers on use of our credit card other value-added services which include peer to peer borrowing. We also plan to generate revenue from advertising on our mobile app.
 
Telidyne Inc. (formerly known as TEC technology, Inc.) was incorporated on December 5, 2011 in the State of Dealware (the “Company”).
 
On July 25, 2012, the Company divested all three of its wholly owned subsidiaries which conducted 100% of the Company’s operations, i.e.: (i) TEC Technology Limited, Hong Kong, (ii) Anhui TEC Tower Co., Limited, PRC, and (iii) Zhejiang TEC Tower Co., Limited, PRC. Thus, subsequent to that date, the Company had no subsidiaries and no operations going forward.

On January 31, 2018, Aron Govil was appointed officer and director of the Company and on April 5, 2018, he acquired majority ownership stake in the Company.
 
On March 22, 2018 Company changed its name to Telidyne Inc. and carried out a reverse split of its common stock, par value $0.001, at a ratio of one-for-one thousand. This reverse stock split became effective on March 22, 2018 and, unless otherwise indicated, all share amounts, per share data, share prices, and conversion rates set forth in this Report and the accompanying financial statements have, where applicable, been adjusted retroactively to reflect this reverse stock split of 1000: 1.


Recent Developments

On March 24, 2018 the Company started developing software to provide technologies and platforms to a wide variety of companies to ecommerce platform utilizing Blockchain technology. The Company has also developed a mobile App named ‘TELI” that facilitates peer to peer payments and third-party payments.
 
Company’s mobile payment platform enables our users to send and receive payments. We are also developing a two-sided network where both merchants and consumers can have TELI accounts with a digital wallet balance functionality. Our payment service enables the completion of payments on our Payments Platform on behalf of our mobile App users. We offer our users the flexibility to use their digital wallet account to make payments to each other for goods and services, as well as to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to add funds into their digital wallet safely using a variety of funding sources, including a bank account, a credit or debit card. Our TELI platform also makes it easier for friends and family to transfer funds to each other for peer to peer transfers. The TELI App is currently available to download on Android phones through Google Play. Presently more than 100 users have downloaded the TELI App.
 
Our revenues are earned by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our users and other payment-related services. We do not charge users any fees to fund or withdraw from their digital TELI account; however, we generate revenue from consumers on use of our credit card other value-added services which include peer to peer borrowing. We also plan to generate revenue from advertising on our mobile app.
 
The Company is experiencing challenges in increasing the number of users for its Mobile App due to limited marketing resulting from lack of sufficient funds. Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected the consumers who are preoccupied with health safety issues and not taking keen interest in following the new mobile Apps in the marketplace. Thus, this pandemic has substantially decreased our revenue opportunities and increased financial uncertainty. Company does not anticipate any material adverse impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s supply chain or the methods used to distribute our products or services. The Company does not expect the anticipated impact of COVID-19 to materially change the relationship between costs and revenues. The exact impact of travel restrictions and border closures on our operations in uncertain at the present time.


On January 18, 2019, the Company re-domiciled from Nevada to Delaware through a Holding Company Reorganization in accordance with section 251(g) of the Delaware general Corporation Law (“DGCL”). In accordance with Section 251(g) of the DGCL, the issuer, Telidyne Inc., the Nevada Company, as previously constituted (the “Predecessor”) became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of a newly formed Delaware corporation, Telidyne Inc. (the “Holding Company”), which became the successor issuer. In other words, the Holding Company is now the public entity.
 
In accordance with section 251(g) of the DGCL, Telidyne Merger Corporation (“Merger Co”), another newly formed Delaware corporation and, prior to the Holding Company Reorganization, was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company, merged with and into the Predecessor, with Merger Co surviving the Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company and Predecessor losing its existence, (the “Merger”); however as of the effective time of the Merger, the designation, rights, powers and preferences of the Predecessor company’s common stock immediately before the Merger became the same as those of the common stock of the Holding Company. Thus in accordance with section 251(g) of the CGCL Holding Company Reorganization all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Predecessor were automatically converted into identical shares of the common stock of the Holding Company on a one-for-one basis, and the Predecessor’s existing stockholders and other equity holders became stockholders and equity holders, as applicable of the Holding Company in the same amounts and percentages as they were in the Predecessor prior to the Holding Company Reorganization. The executive officers and the board of directors of the Holding Company are the same as those of the Predecessor in effect immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization.

Strategy
 
We plan to increase our marketing activities so as to generate the awareness of TELI App and thus generate more downloads and users. As the Company generates more funds it will invest in marketing activities and further enhancing the App’s capabilities.
 
Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, consumer spending patterns, businesses and consumer adoption of digital payment methods, the growth of internet band-width, increased use of mobile Apps by consumers and businesses. The growth of Company will depend upon consumers’ ability to have fast internet access on their mobile devices and the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payments. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:
 

§ | Growing our payment platform by expanding our global platform capabilities, our user base and addressing our user’s evolving demands and concerns related to our mobile platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Instilling confidence and trust in our users by instilling trust and confidence through the use of our mobile platform and minimizing perception of risk in our two-sided Payments Platform, and being technology and platform agnostic;

Suppliers
 
We are not currently dependent on, nor do we expect to become dependent on, any one or a limited number of suppliers. We utilize sub-suppliers and third party vendors to work with us on developing the software and our payment platforms and to date, we have not experienced difficulties either in obtaining fabricated components and other materials and parts or in obtaining qualified subcontractors for installation work, but we cannot assure that we will not experience difficulties in the future.
Competition 
 
The payment processing industry is highly competitive. The level of competition has increased in recent years as other providers of payment processing services have established a sizable market share in the small and medium sized merchant segment. Our primary competitors for these merchants in these markets include financial institutions and their affiliates and well-established payment processing companies that target merchants directly and through third parties, including Bank of America Merchant Services, Chase Paymentech, Elavon, Inc. (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp), First Data Corporation, Heartland Payment Systems, Inc., Vantiv, Inc., Global Payments, Inc. and Wells Fargo. Competing with financial institutions is challenging because they often bundle merchant acquiring services with other banking products. Our growth will depend on the continued growth of electronic payments and our ability to increase our market share through successful competitive efforts to gain new merchants.
 
We compete against all forms of payments, including credit and debit cards; automated clearing house and bank transfers; other online payment services; mobile payments; and offline payment methods, including cash and check. In addition, many financial institutions, subsidiaries of financial institutions or well-established payment processing companies that we compete with have substantially greater capital, technological, management and marketing resources than we have. These factors may allow our competitors to offer better pricing terms to merchants, which could result in a loss of our potential merchants. This competition may effectively limit the prices we can charge our merchants and require us to control costs aggressively in order to maintain acceptable profit margins. Additionally, our future competitors may develop or offer services that have price or other advantages over the services we provide.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have developed what we hope are proprietary technologies that may give us an edge in competing with our competitors. We rely on a combination of trade secrets and know-how to protect our intellectual property. This strategy exposes us to the risk that others may learn of our trade secrets and know-how and employ this knowledge and thereby put us at a severe disadvantage with consequent injury to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace.
 
We face many existing larger and more sophisticated competitors and others who are able enter the markets where we sell our products and compete against us in those markets. We have not obtained and have no plans to obtain any evaluation of our intellectual property rights or whether we may be able to prevail in the event that others claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our intellectual property strategy is or will remain successful and we may suffer losses thereby.

Marketing
 
We sell our products globally through internet advertising, trade directories and various online media outlets.
 
Customers
 
Our principal customers are consumers who have need to send and receive funds from family, friends, peers, coworkers. We also develop software for other companies in any industry.
Government Regulation
 
We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business and the products and services that we offer are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations and the rules and standards of the payment networks that we utilize to provide our electronic payment services, as more fully described below.
 
Dodd-Frank Act 
 
The Dodd-Frank Act and the related rules and regulations have resulted in significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Changes impacting the electronic payments industry include providing merchants with the ability to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers. New rules also contain certain prohibitions on payment network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions. Additionally, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the interchange fees that certain issuers charge merchants for debit transactions will be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transactions. Rules released by the Federal Reserve in July 2011 to implement the Durbin Amendment mandate a cap on debit transaction interchange fees for issuers with assets of $10 billion or greater.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which has assumed responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has the authority to determine whether any non-bank financial company, such as us, should be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System because it is systemically important to the U.S. financial system. Any new rules or regulations implemented by the CFPB or the Financial Stability Oversight Council or in connection with Dodd-Frank Act that are applicable to us, or any changes that are adverse to us resulting from litigation brought by third parties challenging such rules and regulations, could increase our cost of doing business or limit permissible activities.
 
Privacy and Information Security Regulations 
 
We provide services that may be subject to privacy laws and regulations of a variety of jurisdictions. Relevant federal privacy laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which applies directly to a broad range of financial institutions and indirectly, or in some instances directly, to companies that provide services to financial institutions. These laws and regulations restrict the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Our business may also be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also imposes disclosure requirements on entities who take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies. In addition, there are state laws restricting the ability to collect and utilize certain types of information such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers. Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals, state officers and consumer reporting agencies and businesses and governmental agencies that own data.

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Regulation 
 
Our business is subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which we refer to collectively as the “BSA.” The BSA, among other things, requires money services businesses to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records. We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process. We have developed and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address related legal and regulatory requirements and developments.
 
We and many of our merchants are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or UDAP. In addition, the UDAP and other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, may directly impact the activities of certain of our merchants, and in some cases may subject us, as the merchant’s payment processor or provider of certain services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of the merchant through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the Federal Trade Commission and the states attorneys general have authority to take action against non-banks that engage in UDAP or violate other laws, rules and regulations and to the extent we are processing payments or providing services for a merchant that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business.
 
Other Regulations 
 
We are subject to U.S. federal and state unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others we hold that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time such as account balances that are due to a distribution partner or merchant following discontinuation of its relationship with us. The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 requires certain merchant acquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations to provide information returns for each calendar year with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment transactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also subject to backup withholding requirements.
Payment Network Rules and Standards 
 
Payment networks establish their own rules and standards that allocate responsibilities among the payment networks and their participants. These rules and standards, including the PCI DSS, govern a variety of areas including how consumers and merchants may use their cards, data security and allocation of liability for certain acts or omissions including liability in the event of a data breach. The payment networks may change these rules and standards from time to time as they may determine in their sole discretion and with or without advance notice to their participants. These changes may be made for any number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the regulatory environment, to maintain or attract new participants, or to serve the strategic initiatives of the networks and may impose additional costs and expenses on or be disadvantageous to certain participants. Participants are subject to audit by the payment networks to ensure compliance with applicable rules and standards. The networks may fine and penalize and/or suspend the registration of participants for certain acts or omissions or the failure of the participants to comply with applicable rules and standards.
 
An example of a recent standard is EMV, which is mandated by Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover to be supported by payment processors by April 2013 and by merchants by October 2015. This mandate sets new requirements and technical standards, including requiring IPOS systems to be capable of accepting the more secure “chip” cards that utilize the EMV standard and setting new rules for data handling and security. Processors and merchants that do not comply with the mandate or do not use systems that are EMV compliant risk fines and liability for fraud-related losses.
 
To provide our electronic payments services, we must be registered either indirectly or directly as service providers with the payment networks that we utilize. Because we are not a bank, we are not eligible for membership in certain payment networks, including Visa and MasterCard, and are therefore unable to directly access these networks. The operating regulations of certain payment networks, including Visa and MasterCard, require us to be sponsored by a member bank as a service provider. We are not registered with any payment networks. In due course we plan to set up the necessary sponsorships with our banking connections. Any agreement with our bank sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants.
