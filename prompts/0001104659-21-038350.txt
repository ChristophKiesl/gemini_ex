Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer. Immunotherapy is a rapidly evolving field that is redefining cancer care by harnessing a patient’s own immune system to eliminate tumor cells. Our focus is on developing inhibitors of CD47, a checkpoint of the innate immune system. CD47 is emerging as a promising next generation immuno-oncology target following the scientific, clinical and commercial success of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors. We have two product candidates in early stages of clinical development – TTI-622 (a SIRPα-IgG4 Fc fusion protein) and TTI-621 (a SIRPα-IgG1 Fc fusion protein). Both molecules are highly differentiated from the rest of the CD47 field by meaningful monotherapy activity demonstrated across a range of hematologic malignancies, and minimal binding to red blood cells, hence reducing the risk of anemia, a common side effect of some other CD47 agents. In 2021, our immediate goal is to complete ongoing dose escalation studies, and initiate a phase 1b/2 program across a range of both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies.
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading innovator in the field of oncology by targeting the CD47-SIRPα axis, an immune-regulatory pathway that tumor cells exploit to evade the host immune system. We believe we have a differentiated and comprehensive approach to targeting CD47, with the development of two SIRPαFc fusion proteins, TTI-622 and TTI-621. We intend to:

· | Rapidly advance the clinical development of TTI-622 and TTI-621. We are currently in the process of identifying the maximum tolerated or recommended phase 2 doses for both TTI-621 and TTI-622, and plan to rapidly advance both molecules into phase 1b/2 studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus our TTI-622 and TTI-621 clinical programs on promising cancer indications. Because CD47 is highly expressed by multiple hematologic and solid tumors, and high expression is often correlated with negative clinical outcomes, we believe our SIRPαFc fusion proteins have the potential to be effective in a range of cancers. Through our early stage clinical trials we have identified several cancers where we saw monotherapy responses to our SIRPαFc fusion proteins in patients, including B- and T-cell lymphomas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus our TTI-622 and TTI-621 clinical programs on promising combinations. While we believe that there may be a monotherapy path in certain indications for our programs, we are planning to evaluate TTI-622 and TTI-621 primarily in combination with other agents.

Our Product Candidates (SIRPαFc)
 
Our Pipeline
 
We have two SIRPαFc fusion proteins, TTI-622 and TTI-621, in clinical development. TTI-622 consists of the CD47-binding domain of human SIRPα linked to the Fc region of IgG4. It is designed to enhance macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and anti-tumor activity by blocking the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal and generating a moderate activating “eat” signal via the IgG4 Fc. TTI-621 consists of the same CD47-binding domain as TTI-622 but linked to the Fc region of IgG1, which generates a stronger “eat” signal than IgG4. It is anticipated that the distinct “eat” signals will result in different tolerability profiles, thus achieving different levels of drug exposure and CD47 blockade in patients. Specifically, TTI-622 is expected to achieve a high level of CD47 blockade and deliver a moderate “eat” signal, whereas TTI-621 is expected to achieve a lower level of CD47 blockade but deliver a strong “eat” signal. Both agents have been well tolerated and have demonstrated monotherapy activity in patients with B- and T-cell lymphomas.

 Mechanism of Action: Blocking the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal using a SIRPαFc decoy receptor
 
The immune system is the body’s mechanism to identify and eliminate pathogens, and can be divided into the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is the body’s first line of defense to identify and eliminate pathogens and consists of proteins and cells, such as macrophages, that identify and provide an immediate response to pathogens. The adaptive immune system is activated by, and adapts to, pathogens, creating a targeted and durable response. Cancer cells often have the ability to reduce the immune system’s ability to recognize and destroy them.
 
Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that can ingest and destroy (phagocytose) other cells. Macrophage activity is controlled by both positive “eat” and negative “don’t eat me” signals. Recently, a role for macrophages in the control of tumors has been described. Tumor cells may express “eat” signals (e.g. calreticulin) that make themselves visible to macrophages. To counterbalance this increased visibility the tumor cells often express high levels of CD47, which transmits a “don’t eat me” signal by binding SIRPα on the surface of macrophages. High expression of CD47 has been observed across a range of hematologic and solid tumors. In many cases, high CD47 expression was shown to have negative clinical consequences, correlating with more aggressive disease and poor survival.
 
In preclinical studies, TTI-622 and TTI-621 frequently triggered significant macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells in vitro compared to control treatment. In vivo, both fusion proteins exhibited anti-tumor activity in human xenograft models.
 
In addition to their direct anti-tumor activity, macrophages can also function as antigen-presenting cells and stimulate antigen-specific T-cells. Thus, it is possible that increasing tumor cell phagocytosis after SIRPαFc exposure may result in enhanced adaptive immunity. In support of this, CD47 blockade has been recently shown to augment antigen presentation and prime an anti-tumor cytotoxic T-cell response in immune-competent mice. In 2016, we presented data demonstrating that TTI-621 can augment antigen-specific T-cell responses in vitro. CD47 blockade has also been reported to promote tumor-specific T-cell responses through a dendritic cell-based mechanism, although the effect of SIRPαFc on dendritic cells is currently unknown.
 
The figure below illustrates how SIRPαFc blocks the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal and engages activating Fc receptors on macrophages, leading to tumor cell phagocytosis and possibly increased antigen presentation and enhanced T-cell responses.

By inhibiting the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal, we believe SIRPαFc has the ability to promote the macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells in a range of cancers, including but not limited to, acute myeloid leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and solid tumors, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents. Both SIRPαFc fusion proteins enable CD47 blockade with different levels of Fc receptor engagement on macrophages and thus may have unique applications.
 
We have also demonstrated that our SIRPαFc fusion proteins exhibit minimal binding to red blood cells, or RBCs, ex vivo in contrast to some CD47-specific antibodies and a mutated high affinity SIRPαFc. We believe that this property has the potential to confer several possible advantages, including avoidance of drug-induced anemia, avoidance of the “antigen sink effect” (i.e. removal of drug from circulation by RBCs) and non-interference with laboratory blood typing tests.
 
Combination Therapy
 
We believe that SIRPαFc enhancement of macrophage activity, and possibly T-cell responses, could be synergistic with other immune-mediated therapies. Since many cancer antibodies work at least in part by activating cells of the innate immune system, it may be possible to enhance the potency of these agents by blocking the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal that tumor cells deliver to macrophages. We hypothesize that SIRPαFc may act synergistically with other immunological agents, including T-cell checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. pembrolizumab and nivolumab), anti-cancer antibodies, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses or chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR T-cells.
TTI-622 Clinical Development
 
A two-part, multicenter, open-label, phase 1a/1b study of TTI-622 in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory lymphoma and multiple myeloma is currently in progress (NCT03530683). In the ongoing phase 1a dose-escalation part, relapsed or refractory lymphoma patients are being enrolled in sequential dose cohorts to receive TTI-622 once weekly to characterize safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose. In the phase 1b part, patients with untreated AML and multiple myeloma will be treated with TTI-622 in combination with other agents.

On September 8, 2020, we released an update on the ongoing TTI-622 study. In the phase 1a portion of the study, the safety assessment of the 8 mg/kg dosing cohort has been successfully completed. One Grade 4 thrombocytopenia DLT was reported among the six evaluable patients; no additional Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia events have been observed. A total of six objective responses (33%; 1 complete response, 5 partial responses) have been observed among 18 response-evaluable patients treated at dose levels of 0.8, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 mg/kg. Clinical responses have occurred across all dose levels in this range, with three of six (50%) patients achieving responses in the 8.0 mg/kg cohort (response assessment for one additional patient at 8 mg/kg dose was not available). Clinical responses have been observed across multiple lymphoma indications, including DLBCL, CTCL, PTCL and follicular lymphoma. All responses were observed at the first assessment at 8 weeks.
 
We provided a data update at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, annual meeting on December 7, 2020 with a data cut-off as of November 3, 2020. Specifically, we updated that a total of 31 patients had been enrolled in the first seven cohorts, receiving weekly intravenous doses between 0.05-12 mg/kg. All dose levels were well tolerated and a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, was not reached. Adverse events, or AEs, were predominantly Grade 1-2; related AEs ≥Grade 3 were neutropenia (13%), thrombocytopenia (3%) and anemia (3%). Dose-dependent increases in TTI-622 serum exposure supported continued dose escalation beyond 12 mg/kg, and dose-dependent increases in receptor occupancy, or RO, durability were observed. Objective responses were achieved in six of 22 (27%) response-evaluable patients, with an overall response rate, or ORR, of 35% (6/17) among response-evaluable patients at dose levels ≥0.8 mg/kg. Relative to September 8, 2020, the ORR at 8 mg/kg was updated from 3/6 (50%) to 3/7 (43%), after one patient had a 77% target lesion reduction but developed a new concurrent lesion and thus was classified as progressive disease. All responses occurred within the first eight weeks of treatment across multiple lymphoma indications, and included one complete response, or CR, and five partial responses, or PRs. The CR patient treatment was ongoing at 534 days and showed evidence of expansion of new and existing T-cell clones. Among the five patients achieving PRs, three patients discontinued therapy due to progression and two for reasons other than progressive disease. We completed a safety evaluation of the 12 mg/kg dose level, with results indicating no observed dose-limiting toxicity or other major safety concerns, and we escalated dosing to 18 mg/kg. One patient at the 12 mg/kg dose level achieved a stable disease assessment and continued on therapy.
 
Overall, we believe the results presented at the ASH annual meeting demonstrate that TTI-622 exhibits monotherapy activity across multiple lymphoma indications among heavily pre-treated patients (3-9 prior systemic therapies in responders) and a broad potential therapeutic window (0.8-8.0 mg/kg).
 
We intend to provide a further update on our ongoing TTI-622 study in the second quarter of 2021. See “2021 Guidance and R&D Day”.
 
TTI-621 Clinical Development
 
A phase 1 multicenter, open-label study in which patients with advanced relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies receive intravenous TTI-621 is currently in progress (NCT02663518). The study consists of four parts: (a) completed “Parts 1-3” in hematologic malignancies, with dosing up to 0.5 mg/kg, conducted under initial dose-limiting toxicity, or DLT, criteria; and (b) ongoing “Part 4” in CTCL, which allows for dosing above 0.5 mg/kg. Given the transient nature of thrombocytopenia observed in Parts 1-3 of the study, the DLT definition for thrombocytopenia was revised, from Grade 4 of any duration in Parts 1-3, to Grade 4 lasting >72 hours or a platelet count less than 10,000/microliter at any time in Part 4.
 
On September 8, 2020, we released an update on the TTI-621 intravenous study. Preliminary data from Part 4 indicate the weekly infusions of TTI-621 up to 1.4 mg/kg are well tolerated without dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. Platelet decreases generally occurred on dosing days, recovered in 2-4 days, and have not worsened with increasing dose levels. Infusion-related reactions, or IRRs, typically occurred during initial infusions and often resolved without recurrence. One Grade 3 IRR DLT was observed at 1.0 mg/kg. Anti-tumor activity in the 1 mg/kg cohort included one partial response and one skin complete response (overall assessment stable disease) in six evaluable patients; two patients were bridged to allogeneic transplantation. Preliminary data suggest dose-dependent improvements in modified severity weighted assessment tool, or mSWAT, scores in the 0.5 to1.0 mg/kg cohorts (1.4 mg/kg cohort data were not yet available). We reported that the study was dosing at the 2.0 mg/kg level, and the protocol allows for higher dosing if appropriate.
 
We provided a data update at the ASH Annual Meeting on December 7, 2020 with a data cut-off of November 3, 2020. Specifically, we reported that a total of 17 CTCL patients had completed DLT evaluation, including two at the 2 mg/kg dose level. One Grade 4 thrombocytopenia DLT event was observed at 2.0 mg/kg and this cohort was expanded to six patients. Across Parts 1-4, the most common treatment-related AEs were infusion-related reactions (44%) and thrombocytopenia (30%), which was transient and not dose-limiting. Monotherapy activity was observed in CTCL (17% ORR), PTCL (18% ORR) and DLBCL (29% ORR). The majority of these patients received doses of 0.5 mg/kg or lower; a dose-activity relationship in Part 4 was difficult to ascertain due to the small sample sizes. Dose-dependent increases in drug exposure and RO of 40-65% at doses 0.5-1.4 mg/kg were observed. Evidence of changes in both innate and adaptive immune cells was apparent in a responding CTCL patient.

We have also conducted an open-label phase 1 trial in which TTI-621 was delivered by intratumoral injection in patients with relapsed and refractory, percutaneously-accessible cancers. As reported at the ASH 60th Annual Meeting in December 2018, local delivery of TTI-621 was well tolerated, and reductions in Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity, or CAILS scores, which measure local lesion responses, were observed in 91% of evaluable mycosis fungoides patients, with 41% exhibiting reductions of 50% or greater. These responses occurred rapidly within the 2-week induction period. Collectively, these data provide clinical proof-of-concept for TTI-621. As announced in October 2019, the intratumoral study has been closed and we are now focused on intravenous delivery of TTI-621.
 
TTI-621 was granted an Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of CTCL. Orphan Drug Designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug candidate for various development incentives, which may include tax credits for qualified clinical testing, an exemption from fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, and a seven-year marketing exclusivity period following approval.
 
We intend to provide a further update on our ongoing TTI-621 study in the second quarter of 2021. See “2021 Guidance and R&D Day”.
 
Key Takeaways
 
We have a diversified approach to CD47 blockade, with two decoy receptors – TTI-622 (SIRPαFc-IgG4) and TTI-621 (SIRPαFc-IgG1) – in clinical development. We believe that both agents are highly differentiated and have best-in-class potential in the CD47 field due to the following three characteristics:

· | Monotherapy activity. Both TTI-622 and TTI-621 have demonstrated class-leading monotherapy activity (including complete responses), specifically in patients with B- and T-cell lymphomas. We believe this monotherapy activity has the potential to de-risk our CD47 program, and provides us with a strong foundation for combination therapies, a strategy we intend to pursue going forward.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong safety profile. Both TTI-622 and TTI-621 have been well tolerated in patients following intravenous administration. Notably, treatment-related anemia has occurred very infrequently, consistent with the minimal binding of both agents to human RBCs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potential solid tumor advantage. Both TTI-622 and TTI-621 are half the molecular weight (approximately 75 kDa) of monoclonal antibodies (approximately 150 kDa), which we believe may provide for greater penetration into solid tumors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
2021 Guidance and R&D Day
 
In the second quarter of 2021, we plan to hold an R&D Day, at which we will:


· | Provide a data update for TTI-622 and TTI-621, including data for the 18 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg dose cohorts, respectively;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Announce key strategic priorities in terms of target indications and drug combinations across hematologic malignancies and solid tumors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Outline clinical development plan and clinical studies to be initiated in 2021.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plan of Operations
 
Our main focus in the immediate term is to identify the maximum tolerated or recommended phase 2 doses for both TTI-622 in the ongoing study NCT03530683 and TTI-621 under the revised DLT criteria in Part 4 of study NCT02663518. We expect to significantly expand our staffing in 2021, primarily in clinical development and chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, as we intend to initiate multiple phase 1b/2 combination studies. We will also undertake research, manufacturing and regulatory activities to support the CD47 clinical programs.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid innovation of new technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our pipeline and our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue oncology therapeutics. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products.
 
There are a number of other CD47-SIRPα blocking agents in development, including other SIRPαFc fusion proteins, CD47-specific antibodies, SIRPα-specific antibodies, bispecific antibodies and fusion proteins, and small molecule inhibitors. The most advanced competitor molecule is magrolimab (developed by Forty Seven, Inc., recently acquired by Gilead Sciences Inc.), a CD47-specific antibody currently in phase 3 development.
 
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our agents. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 
License agreement with University Health Network (UHN) and The Hospital for Sick Children (HSC)
 
On February 1, 2010 we entered into a License Agreement with the UHN and HSC pursuant to which we licensed intellectual property relating to methods and compounds for the modulation of the SIRPα - CD47 interaction for therapeutic cancer applications. The license agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed technology. The license agreement will terminate on a country-by-country basis, in countries where a valid claim exists, when the last valid claim expires in such country, or if no valid claim exists, when the last valid claim expires in the United States. Our continuing obligations include the payment of development milestones of $0.2 million and $0.2 million on the initiation of phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials respectively, and payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones as well as royalties of either 3% or 1% of net revenues on commercial sales. The regulatory milestone payments amount to $0.8 million on each of the submission of a first biologics license application, or BLA in the U.S. and receipt of first regulatory approval in the U.S. and proportionate payments in other territories worldwide. The aggregate milestones payable on their first achievement under the agreement in the major markets of the U.S., Europe and Asia combined are $4.5 million.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We control two main patent families relating to SIRPα. One family claims the two species of SIRPαFc (TTI-621 and TTI-622) currently in clinical trials and their anti-cancer use. These patent rights are owned outright by Trillium and patent filings have been arranged in the major pharmaceutical markets. In October 2020, we announced that we received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, for the patent application covering TTI-622 composition of matter. On February 2, 2021, this patent was issued as U.S. No. 10,906,954. This patent has claims that cover TTI-622 composition of matter comprising human SIRPα linked to an IgG4 Fc region, as well as claims covering pharmaceutical compositions that contain TTI-622. A composition of matter patent for TTI-621 (SIRPα linked to an IgG1 Fc) has already been granted in the U.S. (U.S. 9,969,789). Composition of matter patents are also granted in Europe, Australia, Japan and China. Patents emerging from this family begin to expire in 2033.

A second SIRPα patent family was in-licensed on an exclusive basis from co-owners UHN and HSC and is a method of use application. This family has been filed in the major markets. In October 2020, we announced that we received a Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for this application, which was issued U.S. Patent No. 10,907,209 on February 2, 2021. This patent provides coverage for the use of SIRPαFc biologics to treat all CD47+ cancer cells and tumors, including hematologic and solid cancers. The claims cover the use of various forms of SIRPα to treat CD47-positive cancers. Method of use patents have also been granted in Japan, Canada and Australia. Patents in this family begin to expire in the year 2029. The foregoing patent granted in Europe was revoked following an opposition and is currently under appeal.
 
We have also filed for patent protection covering additional inventions relating to SIRPα, including anti-cancer drug combination therapies that utilize SIRPαFc, and biomarkers that identify SIRPαFc responders.
 
Government Regulation
 
The development and manufacture of our product candidates are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy, quality and ethics by various governmental authorities around the world. In the United States, biological products are licensed by the FDA for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Both the FDCA and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, clinical trial, manufacturing, quality control, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting involving biological products. The FDA must receive and allow to proceed an investigational new drug, or IND, application before clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol is reviewed by the FDA. FDA licensure also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In Canada, these activities are regulated by the Food and Drugs Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, which are enforced by the Therapeutic Products Directorate, or TPD.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
 
An applicant seeking approval from the FDA to market a biological product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 

· | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to evaluate pharmacokinetics, metabolism and possible toxic effects to provide evidence of the safety of the product candidate. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations.
 
Prior to commencing an initial clinical trial in humans with a product candidate in the United States, an IND must be submitted to the FDA and the FDA must allow the IND to proceed. An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA allowance that such investigational product may be administered to humans in connection with such trial. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the biological product and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are also submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. In Canada, this application is called a CTA. An IND/CTA application must be filed and accepted by the FDA or TPD, as applicable, before human clinical trials may begin.
 
An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve many aspect of the clinical trial including the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects before a clinical trial commences at that institution. The IRB must conduct continuing reviews and reapprove the trial at least annually. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the trial and may recommend halting the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
 
Certain information about certain clinical trials must also be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trials. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. Phase 1 clinical trials for cancer therapeutics are typically conducted on a small number of patients to evaluate safety, dose limiting toxicities, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and to determine the dose for phase 2 clinical trials in humans.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve a larger patient population than phase 1 clinical trials and are conducted to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of a product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Multiple phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning phase 3 clinical trials.

Phase 3 Clinical Trials. Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve testing the investigational product on a much larger population of patients suffering from the targeted condition or disease. These studies involve testing the investigational product in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed test sites (multi-center trials) to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety. These trials also generate information from which the overall risk-benefit relationship relating to the investigational product can be determined and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
 
In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the investigational product. A single phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor’s data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biological product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information.
 
Under the PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to a substantial application user fee. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees are typically increased annually. No user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.
 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. If not accepted, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The application must be published and submitted in an electronic format that can be processed through the FDA’s electronic systems. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. As a condition for approval, the FDA may also require additional non-clinical testing as a phase 4 commitment.
 
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review standard BLAs in 10 months from filing and priority BLAs in six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Biological products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, significant changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. After a BLA is approved for a biological product, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.

Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Sponsors also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product or withdrawal of the product from the market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, disgorgement of profits, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or license revocation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or recalls, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity.

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
TTI-621 has been granted an Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Orphan Drug Designation qualifies the sponsor of the investigational product for various development incentives, which may include tax credits for qualified clinical testing, an exemption from fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, and a seven-year marketing exclusivity period following approval. We may, in the future, seek additional orphan drug designations for our product candidates. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug or biological product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that is can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If an investigational product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review.
 
11

 

Under the FDA’s breakthrough therapy program, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation. The FDA may take other actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including holding meetings with the sponsor and providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development program.
 
A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
 
Pediatric information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product candidate that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the phase 3 or phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, except that PREA will apply to an original NDA or BLA for a new active ingredient that is orphan-designated if the biological product is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.

Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 
FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.
 
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate implementation and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 
In addition to exclusivity under the BPCIA, a biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 
Raw Materials, Manufacturing, and Supply
 
We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes. We produce small quantities of our product candidates in our laboratories for internal use. We believe that sources of raw materials pertinent to our laboratory operations and for manufacturing of our products by a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, are generally available, although we have and may continue to experience supply chain issues due to COVID-19, or other factors.
 
We have established a contract manufacturing relationship for the supply of SIRPαFc that we believe will provide sufficient material for early clinical trials. In addition, we are establishing the basis for long-term commercial production capabilities. However, there can be no assurance that our contract manufacturer will be successful at scaling up and producing our product candidates with the required quality and in the quantities and timelines that we will need for clinical and/or commercial purposes.
 
13

 

We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any product candidates that we may further develop, or in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal regulations. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers' compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations and periodic auditing. If they are deemed out of compliance with such regulations, approvals could be delayed, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
 
The CMOs that we contract with produce some COVID-19 vaccines and we have experienced delays in the scheduled manufacture of our product candidates due to orders under the Defense Production Act and delays in acquiring certain raw materials. We may face further delays in the future due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages, raw material shortages, government intervention, lack of availability of production capacity and disruptions in delivery systems, or otherwise, which could cause us to lose access to manufacturing for our products resulting in a lack of drug supply for use in our clinical trials.
 
If we need to change manufacturers after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay, and disruption of supply. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
We operate from approximately 3,200 square feet of leased office space at 100 CambridgePark Drive, Suite 510, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, 02140 and approximately 22,000 square feet of leased laboratory and office space at 2488 Dunwin Drive, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, L5L 1J9. We perform research and development in our Dunwin facility and use qualified vendors and collaborators to conduct research and development and manufacturing on our behalf. We incur capital expenditures mainly for laboratory equipment, office equipment, computer equipment and leaseholds in the operation of our business.
Employees
 
As at December 31, 2020, we had 33 full-time employees including 6 senior management, 22 research and development staff and 5 finance and administrative staff. Five employees were located at our office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States and 28 employees were located at our office and lab facilities in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.
 
We also use consultants and outside contractors to carry on many of our activities, including preclinical testing and validation, toxicology, assay development, manufacturing, formulation, clinical and regulatory affairs, and clinical trials.
 
None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We focus on identifying, recruiting, developing and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being, health and safety of our employees. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took proactive action from the earliest signs of the COVID-19 outbreak, which included implementing social distancing policies at our facilities, facilitating remote working arrangements and imposing employee travel restrictions.
