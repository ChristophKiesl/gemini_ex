Item 1.  Business
Overview
 
We owned and operated CAKE and getcake.com, a marketing technology company that provided a proprietary solution for advanced analytics, attribution and campaign optimization for digital marketers, and we sold this business on June 18, 2019. We contemporaneously acquired assets from Emerging Growth LLC related to its cannabis industry focused sponsored content and marketing business, or the CFN Business. Our initial ongoing operations will consist primarily of the CFN Business and we will continue to pursue strategic transactions and opportunities.
 
The CFN Business generates revenue through sponsored content, including articles, press releases, videos, podcasts, advertisements and other media, email advertisements and other marketing campaigns run on behalf of public and private companies in the cannabis industry, helping them reach accredited, retail and institutional investors. Most revenue is generated through contracts involving a monthly cash payment.
 
The CFN Business’ primary expenses come from advertising on platforms like Twitter and Facebook and from employee salaries and contractor fees. The CFN Business’ content is primarily produced by a team of freelance writers and video content is produced through various vendors. The CFN Business also incurs hosting and development costs associated with maintaining and improving its website, web applications, and mobile applications. The CFN Business operates several media platforms, including CannabisFN.com, the CannabisFN iOS app, the CFN Media YouTube channel, the CFN Media podcast, and other venues. These properties are designed to educate and inform investors interested in the cannabis industry, as well as provide a platform for the clients of the CFN Business to reach investors. The CFN Business distributes content across numerous online platforms, including the CannabisFN.com website, press releases, financial news syndicates, search engines, YouTube, iTunes, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and others.
 
The CFN Business targets the legal cannabis industry. According to Grand View Research, the global cannabis industry is expected to reach $146.4 billion by 2025, driven by the legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis across a growing number of jurisdictions. According to the Marijuana Index, there are approximately 400 public companies involved in the cannabis industry, which represents the primary target market of the CFN Business. The CFN Business’ services are designed to help private companies prepare to go public and public companies grow their shareholder base through sponsored content and marketing outreach. The success of the CFN Business depends on the legal status of cannabis, investor demand for cannabis investments, investor demand for Psychedelics, investor and consumer demand for CBD and numerous other external factors.
 
The CFN Business competes with other public relations firms for clients, as well as online publishers for investors. Public relations competition includes investor awareness firms like Stockhouse Publishing, Catalyst Xchange, Stonebridge Partners and Midan Ventures. Online publisher competition includes firms like New Cannabis Ventures, Leafly and High Times. The CFN Business is regulated by rules established by the SEC, FINRA, and certain federal and state cannabis regulations.
 
Late in 2020, we launched an e-commerce network focused on the sale of general wellness CBD products. Revenue generated from this new line of business has been minimal as of December 31, 2020. However, we expect to grow and continue marketing this line of business in future periods. 
 
Our principal offices are located at 600 E. 8th Street, Whitefish, Montana 59937. Our telephone number there is: (833) 420-2636. Our corporate website is: www.cfnenterprisesinc.com, , the contents of which are not part of this annual report.
