Net Loss in Fiscal 2016
 
For the first time in over two decades, the Company experienced an annual net loss in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. Also, for the first time during that period, the Company had negative cash flow from its operations. The Company believes that there were various extraordinary factors that contributed to these adverse results, including certain non-recurring charges and expenses. The following factors contributed to the Company’s financial results in fiscal 2016:
 
(a)         On June 15, 2011, the Company purchased Cables Unlimited, Inc. and, in connection therewith, recorded $3.1 million and $410,000 for Cables Unlimited’s goodwill and the tradename (an intangible asset with indefinite life), respectively.  Purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist.  For the fiscal year 2016, Cables Unlimited did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of product sold had lower margins than planned. These results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business. The results of these changes and circumstances lead to the determination that Cables Unlimited did not pass our qualitative assessment and, therefore, a quantitative assessment was required. In connection with the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company quantitatively evaluated the goodwill and intangibles of Cables Unlimited and determined that the carrying value of Cables Unlimited on the Company’s financial statements exceeded its fair market value.  As a result, an impairment to Cables Unlimited's goodwill and tradename was determined and the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to goodwill and tradename of $2.6 million and $150,000, respectively, for the 2016 fiscal year.
 
(b)       As a result of the continuing change in the wireless marketplace, there has been a decreased demand for certain of the Company’s wireless products (including in particular for the Company’s wireless cabling products used by cell towers). During the past few years, the Company benefitted from the demand for the products it sold to wireless service providers who were updating their networks to 4G technologies. Now that much of that upgrading work has been completed, the demand for the Company’s products has softened, resulting in lower sales and narrower gross margins. The decrease in sales was particularly significant in the Company’s Cables Unlimited subsidiary as demand for its Optiflex and other cell tower solutions dried up. This decrease in sales at Cables Unlimited triggered the impairment charge described above. Because of the reduced demand, the Company also reserved or disposed of excess inventory, which resulted in a $900,000 decrease in its inventory balance from the prior year end and negatively impacted the Company’s income. In order to react to this decrease in net sales, during the last two years the Company redirected its focus on certain new products and incurred significant additional marketing and personnel expenses. These efforts increased the Company’s selling and general administrative expenses in fiscal 2016, but did not produce satisfactory returns. As a result, the Company has now ended certain of these unsuccessful programs and has made employee changes, which changes are expected to result in a significant decrease in selling and general expenses in fiscal 2017.
 
(c)       The Company has, during the past two years, made material changes in the composition of its business units, which have resulted in one-time additional legal, accounting, personnel and infrastructure expenses. As described above, in fiscal 2015 the Company purchased its Comnet and Rel-Tech subsidiaries and, in fiscal 2016 the Company sold its Aviel division and closed its Bioconnect division. The Company incurred significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with these acquisitions and dispositions. In addition, the Company has also incurred significant additional expenses in integrating the Comnet and Rel-Tech businesses with the Company’s existing operations. For example, in fiscal 2016 the Company incurred $171,000 of expenses in connection with implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that now integrates all of the Company’s operations on both the East Coast and California.
 
(d)       During fiscal 2016, the Company considered a strategic transaction with another wireless company. After a due diligence and financial review, the Company determined that the transaction was not in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders and, therefore, the proposed transaction was terminated. The Company incurred over $256,000 of professional fees and expenses in connection with the abandoned transaction, which fees and expenses negatively affected the Company’s cash flow and profitability in fiscal 2016.

Operating Divisions/Subsidiaries
 
Connector and Cable Assembly Division The Connector and Cable Assembly Division is engaged in the design, manufacture and distribution of coaxial connector solutions for companies that design, build, operate, maintain and use wireless voice, data, messaging, and location tracking systems.  Coaxial connector products consist primarily of connectors which, when attached to a coaxial cable, facilitate the transmission of analog and digital signals in various frequencies. Although most of the connectors are designed to fit standard products, the Company also sells custom connectors specifically designed and manufactured to suit its customers’ requirements such as the Wi-Fi and broadband wireless markets. The Company’s Connector and Cable Assembly Division typically carry over 1,500 different types of connectors, adapters, tools, and test and measurements kits. The Company’s RF connectors are used in thousands of different devices, products and types of equipment. While the models and types of devices, products and equipment may change from year to year, the demand for the types of connectors used in such products and offered by the Company does not fluctuate with the changes in the end product incorporating the connectors. In addition, since the Company’s standard connectors can be used in a number of different products and devices, the discontinuation of one product typically does not make the Company’s connectors obsolete. Accordingly, most connectors carried by the Company can be marketed for a number of years and are only gradually phased out. Furthermore, because the Company’s connector products are not dependent on any single line of products or any market segment, the Company’s overall sales of connectors do not fluctuate materially when there are changes to any product line or market segment. Sales of the Company’s connector products are, however, dependent upon the overall economy, infrastructure build out by large telecommunications firms and on the Company’s ability to market its products.
 
Cable assembly products consist of various types of coaxial cables that are attached to connectors (usually the Company’s connectors) for use in a variety of communications applications. Cable assemblies manufactured for the Connector and Cable Assembly Division are manufactured at the Company’s California facilities using state-of-the-art automation equipment and are sold through distributors or directly to major OEM accounts. Cable assemblies consist of both standard cable assemblies and assemblies that are custom manufactured for the Company’s clients. The Company offers a line of cable assemblies with over 100,000 cable product combinations. The Company launched its cable assembly operations in 2000.
 
The Connector and Cable Assembly Division also includes Oddcables.com, formerly a stand-alone division that sells coaxial, fiber optic and other connectors and cable assemblies on a retail basis. Effective November 1, 2013, the Oddcables.com Division was integrated with the Connector and Cable Division.
 
The Company designs its connectors at its headquarters in San Diego, California. However, most of the RF connectors are manufactured by third party foreign manufacturers located in Asia. The Company’s Connector and Cable Assembly operations are conducted out of the Company’s San Diego, California, facilities.
 
Cables Unlimited Division Cables Unlimited, Inc. is a custom cable manufacturer that RF Industries, Ltd. purchased in 2011. Cables Unlimited is located in Yaphank, New York, and is operated as a separate division. Cables Unlimited is a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member, authorized to manufacture fiber optic products that are backed by Corning Cable Systems' extended warranty. Cables Unlimited designs, develops and manufactures custom connectivity solutions for the telecommunications and wireless markets.  The products sold by Cables Unlimited include custom and standard copper and fiber optic cable assemblies, adapters and electromechanical wiring harnesses for communications, computer, LAN, automotive fiber optic and medical equipment. In 2012, Cables Unlimited introduced a new custom cabling solution known as OptiFlex. The OptiFlex cable is a hybrid power and communications cable designed and built for wireless service providers who are updating their networks to 4G technologies such as WiMAX, LTE and other technologies.
Comnet Telecom Supply Division RF Industries, Ltd. purchased Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc. in January 2015. Comnet Telecom’s offices and manufacturing facilities are located in East Brunswick, New Jersey. Formed in 1995, Comnet Telecom is a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member that is authorized to manufacture fiber optic telecommunications products that are backed by Corning Cable Systems' extended warranty and is a Telcordia GR-326 certified manufacturer. Comnet Telecommunications manufactures and distributes telecom equipment and cabling infrastructure products used by telecommunications carriers, co-location service companies, and other telecommunication and data center companies in the U.S. across multiple industries. This division is also a supplier of Hot/Cold Aisle Containment as well as Technology Furnishing Solutions. Data center filler panel containment products have recently been developed by this division with production commencing in 2016.
Rel-Tech Electronics Division RF Industries, Ltd. purchased Rel-Tech Electronics, Inc. in June 2015. Rel-Tech’s offices and manufacturing facilities are located in Milford, Connecticut. Founded in 1986, Rel-Tech is a designer and manufacturer of cable assemblies and wiring harnesses for blue chip industrial, oilfield, instrumentation, medical and military customers. Wire and cable assembly products include custom wire harnesses, ribbon cable, electromechanical and kitted assemblies, and networking and communications cabling. DIN and Mini-DIN connector assemblies include power cord, coaxial, Mil-spec, and testing.
 
The Company aggregates operating divisions into operating segments which have similar economic characteristics and are similar in the majority of the following areas: (1) the nature of the product and services; (2) the nature of the production process; (3) the type or class of customer for their products and services; (4) the methods used to distribute their products or services; and (5) if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment. Based upon this evaluation, as of the end of fiscal 2016, the Company has two segments - the “RF Connector and Cable Assembly” segment and the “Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly” segment. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment was comprised of the Connector and Cable Assembly Division and of Aviel Electronics. Since Aviel Electronics was sold in December 2015, the Connector and Cable Assembly Division currently is the only division in this financial reporting segment. The Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment is comprised of the Company’s three operating subsidiaries (Cables Unlimited, Comnet and Rel-Tech). Both Comnet Telecom and Rel-Tech are included in the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. Since the acquisition of Comnet Telecom was effective for financial accounting purposes as of November 1, 2014, Comnet Telecom’s financial results are included in the results of the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment for the entire fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. Financial results for Rel-Tech have been included in the results of the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment beginning June 1, 2015.

Manufacturing
 
The Connector and Cable Assembly Division contracts with outside third parties for the manufacture of a significant portion of its coaxial connectors. However, virtually all of the RF cable assemblies sold by the Connector and Cable Assembly Division during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 were assembled by the Cable Assembly side of the Connector and Cable Assembly Division at the Company’s approved ISO factory in California. The Connector and Cable Assembly Division procures its raw cable from manufacturers with ISO approved factories in the United States, China and Taiwan. The Company is dependent primarily on eleven manufacturers for its coaxial connectors, tools and other passive components and several plants for raw cable. Although the Company does not have manufacturing agreements with these manufacturers for its connectors and cable products, the Company does have long-term purchasing relationships with these manufacturers. There are certain risks associated with the Company’s dependence on third-party manufacturers for some of its products. See “Risk Factors” below. The Company has in-house design engineers who create the engineering drawings for fabrication and assembly of connectors and cable assemblies. Accordingly, the manufacturers are not primarily responsible for design work related to the manufacture of the connectors and cable assemblies.
 
Cables Unlimited manufactures its custom cable assemblies, adapters and electromechanical wiring harnesses and other products in its Yaphank, New York manufacturing facility. Cables Unlimited is an ISO approved factory, as well as a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member, authorized to manufacture fiber optic products and assemblies that are backed by Corning Cable Systems' extended warranty. Cables Unlimited outsources the assembly of a portion of its proprietary OptiFlex cable to a third party manufacturer. The final assembly and termination of the OptiFlex cable is completed by Cables Unlimited at its Yaphank, New York facilities.
 
Comnet Telecom manufactures, assembles and tests its cabling products at its facilities in East Brunswick, New Jersey. Comnet Telecom is a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program approved fiber optic member and a Telcordia GR-326 approved manufacturer also authorized to produce fiber optic products and assemblies that are backed by Corning Cable Systems' extended warranty.
 
Rel-Tech Electronics manufactures its cable assemblies, electromechanical assemblies, wiring harnesses and other products in its Milford, Connecticut, ISO approved manufacturing facility. 
 
Raw Materials
 
Connector materials are typically made of commodity metals such as copper, brass and zinc and include small applications of precious materials, including silver and gold. The Connector and Cable Division purchases most of its connector products from contract manufacturers located in Asia and the United States. The Company believes that the raw materials used in its products are readily available and that the Company is not currently dependent on any supplier for its raw materials. The Company does not currently have any long-term purchase or supply agreements with its connector or suppliers. The Cable Assembly Group obtains coaxial connectors from RF Connector group. The Company believes there are numerous domestic and international suppliers of coaxial connectors.

The Cables Unlimited Division, Comnet Telecom Division and the Rel-Tech Electronics Division purchase all of their products from manufacturers located in the United States. Fiber optic cables are available from various manufacturers located throughout the United States; however, both Cables Unlimited and Comnet Telecom purchase most of their fiber optic cables from Corning Cables Systems LLC. The Company believes that the raw materials used by Cables Unlimited and Comnet Telecom in their products are readily available and that neither division is not currently dependent on any supplier for its raw materials except where Corning Extended Warranty certification is required. Neither Cables Unlimited, nor Comnet Telecom nor Rel-Tech Electronics currently have any long-term purchase or supply agreements with their connector and cable suppliers.
 
Employees
 
As of October 31, 2016, the Company employed 189 full-time employees, of whom 60 were in accounting, administration, sales and management, 123 were in manufacturing, distribution and assembly, and 6 were engineers engaged in design, engineering and research and development. The employees were based at the Company’s offices in San Diego, California (64 employees), Yaphank, New York (33 employees), Milford, Connecticut (62 employees) and East Brunswick, New Jersey (30 employees). The Company also occasionally hires part-time employees. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its employees. The Cables Unlimited Division employs six cable installers who are currently represented by a union. Other than the foregoing installers that belong to a union, none of the Company’s other employees are unionized.
Research and Development
 
The Company’s research and development expenses relate to its engineering activities, which consist of the design and development of new products for specific customers, as well as the design and engineering of new or redesigned products for the industry in general. During the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $747,000 and $775,000 in engineering expenses, respectively. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
The Company owns 13 U.S. patents related to CompPro Product Line that it acquired in May 2015. The CompPro Product Line utilizes a patented compression technology that offers revolutionary advantages for a water-tight connection, easier installation, and improved system reliability on braided cables. The CompPro Product Line is used by wireless network operators, installers and distributors in North America and other parts of the world. The Company also owns the “CompPro” registered trademark associated with the compression cable product line.
 
The Company uses “OptiFlex™” as a trademark for its hybrid cable wireless tower cable solution.
 
Because the Company carries thousands of separate types of connectors and other products, most of which are available in standard sizes and configuration and are also offered by the Company’s competitors, the Company does not believe that its business or competitive position is dependent on patent protection.
 
Under its agreements with Corning Cables Systems LLC, Cables Unlimited and Comnet Telecom are permitted to advertise that they are Corning Cables System CAH Connections Gold Program members.
 
Warranties and Terms
 
The Company warrants its products to be free from defects in material and workmanship for varying warranty periods, depending upon the product. Products are generally warranted to the dealer for one year, with the dealer responsible for any additional warranty it may make. The RF Connector products are warranted for the useful life of the connectors. Although the Company has not experienced any significant warranty claims to date, there can be no assurance that it will not be subjected to such claims in the future.
