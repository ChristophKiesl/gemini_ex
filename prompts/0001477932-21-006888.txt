General Development of Businesses
 
Troika Media Group, Inc. (f/k/a M2 nGage Group, Inc. and f/k/a Roomlinx, Inc., hereinafter the “Company”) was formed in 2003 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On June 12, 2017, the Company entered into and completed a Merger Agreement with Troika Design Group, Inc. (“Troika Merger”). Troika Design Group, Inc. is a strategic brand consultancy with deep expertise in entertainment media, sports, consumer goods and service brands. Prior to the Troika Merger, on October 24, 2016, the Company’s secured lenders took control of all of the equity interests, assets and liabilities of two of the Company’s subsidiaries: M2 nGage Communications Inc., and M2 nGage Inc., and certain operating subsidiaries of the Company also ceased operations. See Business – “Discontinued Operations” below. 
 
On June 29, 2018, the Company acquired all of the equity interests (the “Mission Acquisition”) of Mission Culture LLC and Mission Media Holdings Limited (collectively, “Mission”). Mission is a London-headquartered brand experience and communications agency that specializes in consumer immersion through a cultural lens, via live experiences, brand partnerships, public relations, and social and influencer engagement. Mission was founded in London in 2003 and began its North American operations in 2009. 
 
On May 21, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Troika IO, Inc. (f/k/a Redeeem Acquisition Corp.), a California corporation, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Redeeem LLC, a California limited liability company, its Manager, Kyle Hill and key technical and related staff.  Redeeem, founded in 2018 by Kyle Hill, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange that facilitates the purchase, sale and trade of digital goods using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Redeeem allows virtually any company to safely and easily tokenize products, build decentralized apps (dapps) and provide digital services at a fraction of the cost of building blockchain services in-house. Redeeem’s mission and vision is to create a decentralized network of millions of freelancers connected over multiple blockchains.  Management believes that Redeeem’s experience and technical knowhow in the burgeoning market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is anticipated to add value to the Company’s core business. 
 
Overview
 
Our recently combined company offers clients innovative solutions for driving business performance through consumer experience across all brand touchpoints. Mission’s transatlantic presence in both the United Kingdom and New York enhances Los Angeles based Troika’s existing suite of branding, digital marketing and performance media services, and greatly expands its base and regional reach. TMG focuses on branding, digital marketing and performance media services, using actionable intelligence across all broadcast digital media and live experiences coupled with our internal agency experience and assets to deliver client-based offerings required to meet their brand needs. 
 
Our corporate headquarters are in Los Angeles with operations in New York, New Jersey and London, which allows the team of approximately 98 employees to directly service clients globally. In order to accelerate growth, we intend to offer expanded services to our existing roster of global brands, making the Company more competitive in attracting new clients. 
 
Our goal is to create an agile and comprehensive communications agency that brings together experienced senior executives in every discipline that we offer to our clients. Management believes that culturally connected, personality-led, one-to-one brand and product efforts are the best way to secure clients and motivate sales. Management also believes that by taking its brand, culture, and advertising credentials, coupled with expertise in design, creating experiences, public relations, and digital communications, we will be able to build a fast, agile and accountable business model. We will also continue to develop intellectual property in our work and in the businesses that we seek to acquire.
 
Troika Media Group 
 
In 2017, Troika launched its Troika digital division consisting of Troika Services, Inc. and Troika Analytics whose performance marketing capabilities will allow the Company to measure key performance indicators, thus allowing clients to track return on investment in a way not seen in brand and experience marketing, resulting in actionable intelligence. The recently combined entity creates a complementary group that is talented and well positioned to take Troika’s best in class branding and digital work and uniting it with Mission’s vast credentials in experience, culture, marketing, and public relations. 
 
The Company has the capacity to expand services to provide complete holistic solutions for its clients. The comprehensive offering meets the full needs of clients by providing them with a single agency that can serve all of their communication needs.

Rebranding
 
The Company changed its name to Troika Media Group, Inc. following the Troika Merger in June 2017 to continue to develop the Troika brand name and reputation in the media and design space. The names of the Company’s operating subsidiaries were also changed to reflect the new branding of the entire Company. We believe that this streamlined branding will allow for better name recognition, as well as helping cross-sell our various services to our existing customers.
 
Through its subsidiaries, Troika Media Group, Inc. provides the following services:
 

• | Media Services and Analytics Platform 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Digital Marketing, Data Analytics and Reporting 
• | Media Content for events and hospitality customers 
• | Sponsorship partnerships and advertising opportunities. 
• | Expert in Analytics and Big Data; reputation for technology, innovation and affordability
• | Strategic media buying and planning 
• | Design and Branding 
• | Market Research and Insights 
• | Brand Strategy 
• | 360 Brand Design 
• | Advertising Creative and Sponsorship Integration 
• | Design, Animation and Post Production Studio 
• | Live-Action Production LLC 
• | Brand Experience and Fan Engagement 
• | Content Creation 
• | Sonic Branding and Original Music 

Business Strategy 
 
We continue to execute on all aspects of our business, including our digital technology and media business serving the sports, entertainment and convention center market. We have found that truly successful businesses find ways of taking fixed assets and generating multiple revenue opportunities over those fixed assets, preferably on a contractual monthly recurring revenue or retainer model, thereby improving profitability. The Troika brand brings media and design expertise and experience with a proven track record of success in major brand identity and development projects boasting some of the premier names in the sports and entertainment industries. 
 
We consider our digital technology and media services to be our high growth business. The Troika brand gives the Company in-house, design, content inventory, research and branding services allowing us to bring a suite of engagement services to our clients and making us a “one stop” shop for digital media needs. The new strategic design for the Company combines brand, marketing and fan engagement services provided by Troika with a mobile connectivity and advertising platform provided by Troika Services, Inc. Together, they offer solutions for engaging audiences and fans through various channels. 
 
Troika’s operating subsidiaries are organized into three primary business units: (1) design and brand identity; (2) media content/data analytics and advertising; and (3) platform and intellectual property development, all of which together provide a comprehensive solution for business and media partners.
 
Management believes based on its knowledge of the industry at this stage of digital evolution, the market needs a new breed of a modern agency using open web-first approach to take the power and control out of walled gardens, such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, hands and put it back into the hands of marketers, where it belongs. Today, walled gardens’ intensives are not aligned with marketer’s success.
 
Management believes that holding companies such as GroupM, Publicis, IPG, Dentsu are struggling with baggage, distractions and broken financial models. Our strategy removes value from working media, which is often the most expensive thing a marketer pays for, in automated digital environments and do not help with the walled garden problem.
 
A modern agency not only has to be fully transparent and laser focused on applying data and technology to put control and leverage back in the hands of the marketer with a cross audience strategy, addressable media planning and activation. We need to have world class personalized creativity, with a financial model that allows it to provide highest level of expert service and technology without a need to up-sell useless features. This is our plan and our mission.

Market Opportunity
 
We seek to capitalize on the convergence of wireless, broadband, and content-based service models. Today, we believe that every brand needs engaged audiences and loyal fans and that building an exciting brand experience is key to maintaining fan loyalty and engagement. We also believe that media has been democratized and audiences are becoming ever more fragmented. As a result, brands now struggle to connect with consumers. We are scaling the business by expanding into new verticals, bringing entertainment media category expertise to brands that need to engage consumers on their terms, as audiences and fans. Moreover, growth in new applications in wireless services and multimedia services, increasing demand for high quality mobile and high definition video entertainment services, drive the underlying demand for our branding and analytics services. It is widely accepted that existing networks and technologies cannot fulfill this demand. 
 
The following statistics foretell the expanding market we seek to service:
 

• | Global internet users = 3.4 billion people in 2016 with 10% annual growth is over 50% of the population in 2018 (Internet Trends 2017 – Code Conference, Mary Meeker, May 31, 2017, Kleiner Perkins Conference, hereinafter referred to as “Kleiner Perkins Report”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | 4 Hours and 7 Minutes: According to Digital Trends – Average time spent by users on smartphones daily other than talking. 
• | Digital media use is between 49% and 42% for ages 18-49 (Kleiner Perkins Report ). 
• | According to Forbes, people in the U.S. check their Facebook, Twitter, and other social media accounts a staggering 17 times a day, meaning at least once an hour. 
• | Nielsen Company report reveals that adults in the U.S. devoted approximately 10 hours and 39 minutes each day consuming media during the fourth quarter of 2018. 

 
Although we have been able to pursue our growth strategy, general economic conditions, and market uncertainty may negatively affect our financial results in future periods. We anticipate that the rate of branding and experiential activities will become more predictable however may vary from quarter to quarter. Consequently, if anticipated business in any quarter do not occur when expected, expenses and resource levels could be disproportionately high, and our operating results for that quarter and future quarters may be adversely affected. Further, given the lag between the incurrence of expenses in connection with branding and experiential services, we anticipate that, while we will see organic growth that positions us for future profitability, our costs of sales and other operating expenses may exceed our revenues in the near term. We have incurred operating losses since our inception.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every aspect of the nation and the world, it has created opportunities for companies despite the unfortunate disruptions and changes in life. Moreover, with the recent remission of the international impact associated with the COVID-19 (aka “coronavirus”) pandemic, the Company expects to be able to acquire entities distressed by the pandemic upon favorable terms and at a cost savings to the Company and thereby increase our capabilities in a more cost-effective manner. These entities will likely already be streamlined as a result of measures taken to reduce the impact of the pandemic and integration and realization of synergies which complement and augment our business.

Business of Redeeem
 
Redeeem, founded in 2018 by Kyle Hill, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange that facilitates the purchase, sale and trade of digital goods using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Redeeem allows virtually any company to safely and easily tokenize products, build decentralized apps (dapps) and provide digital services at a fraction of the cost of building blockchain services in-house. Redeeem’s mission and vision is to create a decentralized network of millions of freelancers connected over multiple blockchains.

Most freelance marketplaces are built on Web 2.0 standards that rely on traditional bank rails and store data in centralized data warehouses, making them vulnerable to hacks, seizures, censorships and outages. Many projects are exploring blockchains as a way to improve efficiencies in their supply chain. Web 2.0 marketplaces are social networks and mobile-first and are always on cloud-driven computing. Web 3.0 uses artificial intelligence (AI)-driven services using a decentralized (e.g., blockchain) data architecture with edge computing infrastructure. Currently, there is no specialized framework to build the next standard Web 3.0 marketplace specifically for a global workforce who want to live on the latest decentralized standards. The 3.0 philosophy contrasts 2.0 internet mainly in the way it allows data to be transparent, interconnected, immutable and decentralized from day one to build towards more open standards.
 
Redeeem believes, based on management’s extensive knowledge of the industry, that it is building one of the first token as a service (TAAS) platforms that helps the legacy Web 2.0 freelance marketplace modernize to Web 3.0 standards without expensive or complicated integrations. The most disruptive Web 3.0 protocol is Bitcoin, the world’s first and most successful implementation of a blockchain. The three areas of disruption the Buyer will focus on in digital currencies are decentralized finance (defi), decentralized apps (dapps) and digital services.
 
With a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin tokens, Bitcoin gives people living in hyperinflationary countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, the ability to protect their financial assets in bitcoins. Nearly half of the “unbanked” population do not have a reliable or efficient access to a bank or financial institution, but with Bitcoin they don’t need centralized bank accounts. Redeeem’s business-to-business (B2B) white-label (for individual clients) platform can be used by founders, entrepreneurs and small business owners to accelerate their business in any industry using blockchain services. Redeeem may explore education services to help educate and onboard customers faster and easier than with manual consulting services.
 
Redeeem’s experience with NFTs and other forms of crypto assets will augment Troika’s core business by adding additional offerings. An NFT is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files like wine, gift cards, physical artwork, tickets to live events, and other collectibles. NFTs can also be used to connect artists with collectors without central intermediaries. NFTs can reduce risk in transactions, improve overall transparency, simplify online trading, replace traditional banking operations, and thousands of other creative opportunities. Much of the current market for NFTs is centered around collectibles, such as digital artwork, sports cards, and rarities. One of the most popular NFT marketplaces is undoubtedly NBA TopShot, a marketplace created by Dapper Labs to collect digital “moments” from historical NBA games. The Vancouver-based gaming company Dapper Labs was valued at $7.5 billion in the most recent fundraise in April 2021. Other NFT marketplaces include Axie Infinity, Sorare, CryptoPunks, CryptoKitties, Rarible and OpenSea.
 
Competitive Advantages.

Marketplace
 
Troika intends to evolve into a mass media, entertainment and digital assets platform that helps companies realize their brand value through apps, tokens, games and live experiences. Troika Digital Assets, headquartered in Santa Monica and Hollywood, intends to continue their path to become a regulated blockchain platform and digital bank that aims to build a more open, digital world. Redeeem has already entered the industry verticals of gift cards, bank transfers, fine wine, crypto vouchers, NFT artwork and press releases, and they expect to launch additional verticals in 2021 all under the Troika umbrella. Troika’s vast entertainment, sports and marquee brand clients will similarly leverage the new blockchain services and NFT capabilities without building custom marketplaces for each brand.
Future Acquisitions
 
The Company plans to acquire a strategic partner to further bolster its consulting and digital media marketing and digital programmatic buying strategy. Prior to the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic the Company was in discussions with several firms with market expertise, proprietary technological, leadership and experience within the programmatic ecosystem, coupled with in-house creative teams, that have managed substantive campaigns for clients. We were forced to terminate all negotiations with future acquisitions upon the onset of COVID-19. Such an acquisition would further solidify the Company’s stature as a definitive group for brand consultancy, strategy, digital media and marketing excellence. We cannot assure you that we will consummate an acquisition on favorable terms if at all. 
 
As a part of the TMG family of companies, the future acquisitions would be integrated with the Troika Services, Inc. subsidiary to combine the data intelligence and performance media group responsible for analyzing and executing on the most measurable touch points and key performance indicators of the consumer/brand experience. 
 
Competition for the Combined Entity
 
While we compete with some great agencies, we believe that we stand alone in providing clients with an integrated suite of anthropological research and insights, strategic brand consulting, brand creative and advertising solutions that engage consumers as audiences and fans. We regularly compete with world-renowned “digital” agencies, brand consultancies, boutique advertising agencies and create services studios. 
 
Although many are much larger organizations, they may be less apt to handle our market and lack creativity. The Company believes that it is able to brand services, and competitive pricing. It further believes that its technology and offerings are well positioned to compete in this marketplace, provide a superior experience for end users, and provide for the most efficient use of network resources. While there are other companies offering such services, The Company is one of a limited number of companies that has the ability to offer combined media and content services to major corporations, consumer brands and sporting owners.
 
Regulatory Obligations
 
Services based on customer analytics raises privacy concerns that can impact state and federal law and U.K. and European Union laws pertaining to personal information and data protection depending on if the data is personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable. Monitoring of programs to ensure that personally identifiable information is not disclosed is necessary to ensure the company does not violate state and federal law and European law. Moreover, data collection associated with minors imposes differing and more stringent obligations on our use of such data, in particular in the U.K and European Union. Our terms of service with customers and users will require proper disclosure of our uses of the information in order to obtain proper consent from users and customers in order to avoid privacy concerns and potential consumer protection law violations. See “Risk Factors - Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters.

A money services business (“MSB”), such as Redeeem, is required to register with FinCEN, pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. The May 2019 Guidance regarding virtual currency requires a money transmitter (“MT”) to register if it accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or buys and sells virtual currency and exempts unhosted wallets. Seller Transactions likely require Redeeem to register and comply with FinCEN’s regulations because Redeeem provides the seller with a hosted digital wallet. Redeeem’s bitcoin wallet is a hosted digital wallet because the buyer purchases redeemable gift cards (“RGCs”) with fiat currency and Redeeem issues the RGCs to purchase Third-Party Gift Cards with cryptocurrency held in a seller’s wallet. The seller instructs Redeeem to transfer cryptocurrency from its wallet to a third-party wallet.
