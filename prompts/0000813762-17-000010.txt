Business Overview
Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises”) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises Holdings”) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. References to "we," "our" or "us" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 
Icahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc. (“Icahn Enterprises GP”), which is indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn, owns a 1% general partner interest in each of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings as of December 31, 2016. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of our operations. Therefore, the financial results of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to debt, as discussed further in Note 10, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements, and the allocation of the general partner interest, which is reflected as an aggregate 1.99% general partner interest in the financial statements of Icahn Enterprises. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 90.1% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of March 1, 2017. 
Mr. Icahn's estate has been designed to assure the stability and continuation of Icahn Enterprises with no need to monetize his interests for estate tax or other purposes. In the event of Mr. Icahn's death, control of Mr. Icahn's interests in Icahn Enterprises and its general partner will be placed in charitable and other trusts under the control of senior Icahn Enterprises executives and family members.
We are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses: Investment, Automotive, Energy, Railcar, Gaming, Metals, Mining, Food Packaging, Real Estate and Home Fashion. Segment and geographic information for our reporting segments, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for each of the three years ended December 31, 2016 is presented in Note 13, “Segment and Geographic Reporting,” to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Report. Also, refer to Note 3, “Operating Units,” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information for each of our reporting segments.
Business Strategy and Core Strengths
The Icahn Strategy
Across all of our businesses, our success is based on a simple formula: we seek to find undervalued companies in the Graham & Dodd tradition, a methodology for valuing stocks that primarily looks for deeply depressed prices. However, while the typical Graham & Dodd value investor purchases undervalued securities and waits for results, we often become actively involved in the companies we target. That activity may involve a broad range of approaches, from influencing the management of a target to take steps to improve shareholder value, to acquiring a controlling interest or outright ownership of the target company in order to implement changes that we believe are required to improve its business, and then operating and expanding that business. This activism has typically brought about very strong returns over the years.
Today, we are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in the following operating businesses: Investment, Automotive, Energy, Railcar, Gaming, Metals, Mining, Food Packaging, Real Estate and Home Fashion. As of December 31, 2016, through our Investment segment, we have significant positions in various investments, which include American International Group, Inc. (AIG), Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG), Freeport McMoRan Inc. (FCX), Herbalife Ltd. (HLF), Herc Holdings, Inc. (HRI), Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ), Navistar International Corp. (NAV), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL), The Manitowoc Company Inc. (MTW), Manitowoc Foodservice Inc. (MFS) and Xerox Corporation (XRX).
Several of our operating businesses started out as investment positions in debt or equity securities, held either directly by us or Mr. Icahn. Those positions ultimately resulted in control or complete ownership of the target company. For example, in 2012, we acquired a controlling interest in CVR Energy, Inc. (‘‘CVR’’), which started out as a position in our Investment segment and is now an operating subsidiary that comprises our Energy segment. As of December 31, 2016, based on the closing sale price of CVR stock and distributions since we acquired control, we had gains of approximately $1.3 billion on our 
1

purchase of CVR. The acquisition of CVR, like our other operating subsidiaries, reflects our opportunistic approach to value creation, through which returns may be obtained by, among other things, promoting change through minority positions at targeted companies in our Investment segment or by acquiring control of those target companies that we believe we could run more profitably ourselves.
During the next several years, we see a favorable opportunity to follow an activist strategy that centers on the purchase of target stock and the subsequent removal of any barriers that might interfere with a friendly purchase offer from a strong buyer. Alternatively, in appropriate circumstances, we or our subsidiaries may become the buyer of target companies, adding them to our portfolio of operating subsidiaries, thereby expanding our operations through such opportunistic acquisitions. We believe that the companies that we target for our activist activities are undervalued for many reasons, often including inept management. Unfortunately for the individual investor, in particular, and the economy, in general, many poor management teams are often unaccountable and very difficult to remove.
Unlike the individual investor, we have the wherewithal to purchase companies that we feel we can operate more effectively than incumbent management. In addition, through our Investment segment, we are in a position to pursue our activist strategy by purchasing stock or debt positions and trying to promulgate change through a variety of activist approaches, ranging from speaking and negotiating with the board and CEO to proxy fights, tender offers and taking control. We work diligently to enhance value for all shareholders and we believe that the best way to do this is to make underperforming management teams and boards accountable or to replace them.
The Chairman of the Board of our general partner, Carl C. Icahn, has been an activist investor since 1980. Mr. Icahn believes that the current environment continues to be conducive to activism. Many major companies have substantial amounts of cash. We believe that they are hoarding cash, rather than spending it, because they do not believe investments in their business will translate to earnings.
We believe that one of the best ways for many cash-rich companies to achieve increased earnings is to use their large amounts of excess cash, together with advantageous borrowing opportunities, to purchase other companies in their industries and take advantage of the meaningful synergies that could result. In our opinion, the CEOs and Boards of Directors of undervalued companies that would be acquisition targets are the major road blocks to this logical use of assets to increase value, because we believe those CEOs and Boards are not willing to give up their power and perquisites, even if they have done a poor job in administering the companies they have been running. In addition, acquirers are often unwilling to undertake the arduous task of launching a hostile campaign. This is precisely the situation in which we believe a strong activist catalyst is necessary.
We believe that the activist catalyst adds value because, for companies with strong balance sheets, acquisitions of their weaker industry rivals is often extremely compelling financially. We further believe that there are many transactions that make economic sense, even at a large premium over market. Acquirers can use their excess cash, that is earning a very low return, and/or borrow at the advantageous interest rates now available, to acquire a target company. In either case, an acquirer can add the target company’s earnings and the income from synergies to the acquirer’s bottom line, at a relatively low cost. But for these potential acquirers to act, the target company must be willing to at least entertain an offer. We believe that often the activist can step in and remove the obstacles that a target generally may seek to use to prevent an acquisition.
It is our belief that our strategy will continue to produce strong results into the future. We believe that the strong cash flow and asset coverage from our operating segments will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity.
Core Strengths
We believe that our core strengths include: identifying and acquiring undervalued assets and businesses, often through the purchase of distressed securities; increasing value through management, financial or other operational changes; and managing complex legal, regulatory or financial issues, which may include bankruptcy or insolvency, environmental, zoning, permitting and licensing issues.
The key elements of our business strategy include the following:
Capitalize on Growth Opportunities in our Existing Businesses.  We believe that we have developed a strong portfolio of businesses with experienced management teams. We may expand our existing businesses if appropriate opportunities are identified, as well as use our established businesses as a platform for additional acquisitions in the same or related areas.
Drive Accountability and Financial Discipline in the Management of our Business. Our Chief Executive Officer is accountable directly to our board of directors, including the Chairman, and has day-to-day responsibility, in consultation with our Chairman, for general oversight of our business segments. We continually evaluate our operating subsidiaries with a view towards maximizing value and cost efficiencies, bringing an owner's perspective to our operating businesses. In each of these businesses, we assemble senior management teams with the expertise to run their businesses and boards of directors to oversee the management of those businesses. Each management team is responsible for the day-to-day operations of its businesses and directly accountable to its board of directors. 
2

Seek to Acquire Undervalued Assets.  We intend to continue to make investments in businesses that we believe are undervalued and have potential for growth. We also seek to capitalize on investment opportunities arising from market inefficiencies, economic or market trends that have not been identified and reflected in market value, or complex or special situations. Certain opportunities may arise from companies that experience disappointing financial results, liquidity or capital needs, lowered credit ratings, revised industry forecasts or legal complications. We may acquire businesses or assets directly or we may establish an ownership position through the purchase of debt or equity securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
Use Activism to Unlock Value. As described above, we become actively involved in companies in which we invest.  Such activism may involve a broad range of activities, from trying to influence management in a proxy fight, to taking outright control of a company in order to bring about the change we think is required to unlock value. The key is flexibility, permanent capital and the willingness and ability to have a long-term investment horizon.
Investment
Background
Our Investment segment is comprised of various private investment funds, including Icahn Partners L.P. ("Icahn Partners") and Icahn Partners Master Fund LP (the "Master Fund", and together with Icahn Partners, the "Investment Funds"), through which we invest our proprietary capital. We and certain of Mr. Icahn's wholly owned affiliates are the sole investors in the Investment Funds. Icahn Onshore LP and Icahn Offshore LP (together, the "General Partners") act as the general partner of Icahn Partners and the Master Fund, respectively. The General Partners provide investment advisory and certain administrative and back office services to the Investment Funds but do not provide such services to any other entities, individuals or accounts. Interests in the Investment Funds are not offered to outside investors. 
Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the General Partners is set and led by Mr. Icahn. The Investment Funds seek to acquire securities in companies that trade at a discount to inherent value as determined by various metrics, including replacement cost, break-up value, cash flow and earnings power and liquidation value.
The General Partners utilize a process-oriented, research-intensive, value-based investment approach. This approach generally involves three critical steps: (i) fundamental credit, valuation and capital structure analysis; (ii) intense legal and tax analysis of fulcrum issues such as litigation and regulation that often affect valuation; and (iii) combined business valuation analysis and legal and tax review to establish a strategy for gaining an attractive risk-adjusted investment position. This approach focuses on exploiting market dislocations or misjudgments that may result from market euphoria, litigation, complex contingent liabilities, corporate malfeasance and weak corporate governance, general economic conditions or market cycles and complex and inappropriate capital structures.
The Investment Funds are often activist investors ready to take the steps necessary to seek to unlock value, including tender offers, proxy contests and demands for management accountability. The Investment Funds may employ a number of strategies and are permitted to invest across a variety of industries and types of securities, including long and short equities, long and short bonds, bank debt and other corporate obligations, options, swaps and other derivative instruments thereof, risk arbitrage and capital structure arbitrage and other special situations. The Investment Funds invest a material portion of their capital in publicly traded equity and debt securities of companies that the General Partners believe to be undervalued by the marketplace. The Investment Funds often take significant positions in the companies in which they invest.
Income
The results of our Investment segment are primarily driven by the performance of the Investment Funds and our interests therein; the General Partners do not receive any special profits interest allocations or incentive allocations. 
Affiliate Investments
We and Mr. Icahn, along with the Investment Funds, have entered into a covered affiliate agreement, which was amended on March 31, 2011, pursuant to which Mr. Icahn agreed (on behalf of himself and certain of his affiliates, excluding Icahn Enterprises, Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries) to be bound by certain restrictions on their investments in any assets that the General Partners deem suitable for the Investment Funds, other than government and agency bonds and cash equivalents, unless otherwise approved by our Audit Committee. In addition, Mr. Icahn and such affiliates continue to have the right to co-invest with the Investment Funds. We have no interest in, nor do we generate any income from, any such co-investments, which have been and may continue to be substantial.
3

Employees
Our Investment segment is supported by an experienced team of approximately 20 professionals as of December 31, 2016, including an investment, legal and operations group. In many cases, team members have worked together successfully and have provided business, investing and legal services for a number of years with respect to the Investment Funds' operations.
Automotive
Background
We conduct our Automotive segment through our wholly owned subsidiaries Federal-Mogul Holdings LLC ("Federal-Mogul"), IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC ("IEH Auto"), effective June 1, 2015, and Pep Boys - Manny, Moe and Jack ("Pep Boys"), effective February 3, 2016. 
Prior to its conversion to a Delaware limited liability company on February 14, 2017, Federal-Mogul, previously known as Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation, was organized in Delaware as a corporation. Federal-Mogul became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours effective January 23, 2017, as discussed below. Prior to January 23, 2017, Federal-Mogul was a majority owned subsidiary of ours with publicly traded common stock and as of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 82.0% of the outstanding common stock of Federal-Mogul. 
On September 6, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Federal-Mogul pursuant to which, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we commenced a cash tender offer (the "Federal-Mogul Tender Offer") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Federal-Mogul’s common stock not already owned by us for a purchase price of $9.25 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any applicable tax withholding. The Federal-Mogul Tender Offer was subsequently extended to January 18, 2017 and the purchase price per share was subsequently increased to $10.00 per share. On January 23, 2017, we paid for the shares validly tendered in the Federal-Mogul Tender Offer and effected a short form merger as the second and final step of the acquisition.
On February 3, 2016, pursuant to a tender offer, we acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of Pep Boys and on February 4, 2016, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Pep Boys. The primary reasons for the acquisition of Pep Boys were to add new product lines to our Automotive segment, to provide operating synergies, to strengthen distribution channels and to enhance our Automotive segment's ability to better service its customers. The total value for the acquisition of Pep Boys was approximately $1.2 billion, including the fair value of our equity interest in Pep Boys just prior to our acquisition of a controlling interest. 
On June 1, 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary, IEH Auto, acquired substantially all of the auto parts assets in the United States of Uni-Select, Inc., a leading automotive parts distributor for domestic and imported vehicles. 
 Federal-Mogul is operated independently from IEH Auto and Pep Boys. Pep Boys and IEH Auto are being operated together under their parent company and wholly owned subsidiary of ours, IEP Auto Holdings LLC.
Business
Federal-Mogul
Federal-Mogul is a leading global supplier of technology and innovation in vehicle and industrial products for fuel economy, emissions reduction and safety systems. Federal-Mogul serves original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) and servicers (“OES”) (collectively “OE”) of automotive, light, medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, off-road, agricultural, marine, rail, aerospace, power generation and industrial equipment, as well as the global aftermarket. Federal-Mogul seeks to participate in both of these markets by leveraging its original equipment product engineering and development capability, manufacturing know-how, and expertise in managing a broad and deep range of replacement parts to service the aftermarket. Federal-Mogul is a leading technology supplier and a market share leader in several product categories. As of December 31, 2016, Federal-Mogul had current OEM products included on more than 400 global vehicle platforms and more than 800 global powertrains used in light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. Federal-Mogul offers premium brands, OE replacement and entry/mid level products for all aftermarket customers. Therefore, Federal-Mogul can be first to the aftermarket with new products, service expertise and customer support. 
Federal-Mogul operates with two end-customer focused businesses. The Powertrain business focuses on original equipment powertrain products for automotive, heavy-duty and industrial applications. The Motorparts business sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global aftermarket and also serves original equipment manufacturers with products including braking, wipers and a limited range of components. This organizational model allows for a strong product line focus benefiting both original equipment and aftermarket customers and enables Federal-Mogul to be responsive to customers’ needs for superior products and to promote greater identification with Federal-Mogul premium brands. Additionally, 
4

this organizational model enhances management focus to capitalize on opportunities for organic or acquisition growth, profit improvement, capital allocation and business model optimization in line with the unique requirements of the two different customer bases and business models.
Federal-Mogul has manufacturing facilities and distribution centers in 24 countries and, accordingly, Federal-Mogul’s businesses derive sales from both domestic and international markets. The attendant risks of Federal-Mogul’s international operations are primarily related to currency fluctuations, changes in local economic and political conditions, extraterritorial effects of United States laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and changes in laws and regulations.
Federal-Mogul is a reporting company under the Exchange Act and files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that are publicly available.
IEH Auto and Pep Boys
IEH Auto has 21 distribution centers and 288 corporate-owned stores in the United States and supports a network of more than 2,000 independent wholesalers. Through its banner and technical support programs as well as its offering of premium auto parts, IEH Auto has built its reputation on being the partner of choice for independent entrepreneurs eager to tap into the strength of a large network. 
Pep Boys has 804 locations in the automotive aftermarket industry located throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Pep Boys stores are organized into a hub and spoke network consisting of Supercenters and Service & Tire Centers. Supercenters average approximately 20,000 square feet and combine a parts and accessories store with professional service centers that perform a full range of automotive maintenance and repair services. Most of the Pep Boys Supercenters also have a commercial sales program that provides prompt delivery of parts, tires and equipment to automotive repair shops and dealers. Service & Tire Centers, which average approximately 6,000 square feet, provide automotive maintenance and repair services in neighborhood locations that are conveniently located where our customers live or work. 
Other Acquisitions
In addition to the IEH Auto, Pep Boys and Federal-Mogul acquisitions as described above, our Automotive segment businesses directly acquired several other businesses throughout 2016, 2015 and 2014. The combination of these acquisitions added new product lines to our Automotive segment, providing operating synergies, strengthening distribution channels and enhancing our Automotive segment's ability to better service its customers. Refer to Note 3, “Operating Units,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

IEH Auto and Pep Boys
The automotive aftermarket industry is in the mature stage of its life cycle. Over the past decade, consumers have moved away from do-it-yourself (“DIY”) toward do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) due to increasing vehicle complexity and electronic content, as well as decreasing availability of diagnostic equipment and know-how. Consistent with this long-term trend, IEH Auto's and Pep Boys' long-term strategy is to grow their sales to DIFM distributors and DIFM service professionals, grow their automotive service business, and maintain their DIY customer bases by offering the newest and broadest product assortment in the automotive aftermarket. IEH Auto and Pep Boys provide their customers with access to over two million replacement parts for domestic and imported vehicles through an extensive network of suppliers. They seek to provide (i) an extensive selection of product offerings; (ii) competitive pricing; (iii) exceptional in-store service experience; and (iv) superior delivery to their customers.
Research and Development
Federal-Mogul’s research and development activities are conducted at its technical centers. Within the United States, these centers are located in Skokie, Illinois; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Plymouth, Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Smithville, Tennessee. Internationally, Federal-Mogul's technical centers are located in Araras, Brazil; Aubange, Belgium; Chapel-en-le-Frith, United Kingdom; Coventry, United Kingdom; Burscheid, Germany; Nuremberg, Germany; Wiesbaden, Germany; Bad Camberg, Germany; Glinde, Germany; Kostelec, Czech Republic; Gorzyce, Poland; and Shanghai, China.
Each of Federal-Mogul's business units is engaged in engineering, research and development efforts and works closely with customers to develop custom solutions to meet their needs. Total expenditures for research and development activities, including product engineering and validation costs, were $192 million, $189 million, and $192 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
IEH Auto and Pep Boys do not conduct research and development.
Restructuring Activities
Federal-Mogul's restructuring activities are undertaken as necessary to execute its strategy and streamline operations, consolidate and take advantage of available capacity and resources, and ultimately to achieve net cost reductions and productivity improvements. These restructuring activities include efforts to integrate and rationalize businesses and to relocate manufacturing operations to best cost markets.
Federal-Mogul's restructuring activities are further discussed in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in Note 3, “Operating Units,” to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Report.
IEH Auto and Pep Boys do not have restructuring activities.
Products and Services
Federal-Mogul is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of automotive parts. The following provides an overview of products manufactured and distributed by Federal-Mogul by product group:

• | Powertrain. Federal-Mogul's Powertrain business primarily represents its OE business. The Powertrain business offers a diverse array of market-leading products for OE applications, including pistons, piston rings, piston pins, cylinder liners, valve seats and guides, ignition products, dynamic seals, bonded piston seals, combustion and exhaust gaskets, static gaskets and seals, rigid heat shields, engine bearings, industrial bearings, bushings and washers, element resistant systems protection sleeving products, acoustic shielding and flexible heat shields. Comprehensive design capability and an extensive product portfolio enable effective delivery of a broad range of engine and driveline components as well as engineered solutions to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions or enhance vehicle performance and durability. The Powertrain business' products are used in automotive, motorcycle, light truck, heavy-duty, industrial, commercial equipment (construction, agricultural, power generation, marine and railway), aerospace, and small air-cooled engine applications. 


• | Motorparts. Federal-Mogul's Motorparts business sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global vehicle aftermarket while also serving the OE market with products including braking, wipers and chassis components. 

6

The Motorparts business’ products are utilized widely in vehicle braking systems and chassis, as well as in engine and sealing applications and general service. 
IEH Auto and Pep Boys do not manufacture parts but are engaged in the distribution of automotive parts in the aftermarket. Pep Boys also provides automotive services to its customers. Each service location performs a full range of automotive maintenance and repair services (except body work) and installs tires, parts and accessories.
Customers
The automotive light vehicle market, as well as the medium duty/heavy duty commercial market, is comprised of two primary businesses: the OE market in which Federal-Mogul’s products are used in the manufacture of new vehicles and OE dealer service parts, and the global aftermarket, in which Federal-Mogul’s, IEH Auto's and Pep Boys' products are used as replacement parts for all vehicles in operation on the road, including all previous models.

• | The OE Market. Demand for component parts in the OE market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced. Although OE demand is tied to planned vehicle production, parts suppliers also have the opportunity to grow through increasing their product content per vehicle, by increasing market share and by expanding into new or emerging markets. Companies with a global presence, leading technology and innovation, and advanced product engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities are best positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. Federal-Mogul supplies OEs with a wide variety of technologically innovative parts, substantially all of which are manufactured by it. Federal-Mogul’s OE customers consist of automotive and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers as well as agricultural, off-highway, marine, railroad, aerospace, high performance and industrial application manufacturers. Federal-Mogul has well-established relationships with substantially all major American, European and Asian automotive OEs.


• | The Aftermarket Business. Products for the global vehicle aftermarket are sold directly to a wide range of distributors, retail parts stores and mass merchants that distribute these products to professional service providers, “do-it-yourself” consumers and in some cases, directly to service chains. Demand for aftermarket products historically has been driven by three primary factors: (i) the number of vehicles in operation; (ii) the average age of vehicles in operation; and (iii) vehicle usage trends. Federal-Mogul’s aftermarket customers include independent warehouse distributors who redistribute products to local parts suppliers, distributors of heavy-duty vehicular parts, engine rebuilders, retail parts stores and mass merchants. The breadth of Federal-Mogul’s product lines, the strength of its leading brand names, marketing expertise, sizable sales force, and its distribution and logistics capability are central to the success of Federal-Mogul’s Motorparts operations. IEH Auto and Pep Boys distribute automotive parts in the aftermarket to commercial customers in the DIFM market as well as the retail and DIY markets. Pep Boys also provides automotive services to its customers.

No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of Federal-Mogul’s net sales during 2016. Federal-Mogul's customers include IEH Auto and Pep Boys. No individual customer accounted for more than 2% of both IEH Auto’s and Pep Boys' net sales during 2016. 
Competition
The global vehicular parts business is highly competitive. Federal-Mogul competes with many independent manufacturers and distributors of component parts globally. In general, competition for sales is based on price, product quality, technology, delivery, customer service and the breadth of products offered by a given supplier. Federal-Mogul is meeting these competitive challenges by developing leading technologies, efficiently integrating and expanding its manufacturing and distribution operations, widening its product coverage within its core businesses, restructuring its operations and transferring production to best cost countries, and utilizing its worldwide technical centers to develop and provide value-added solutions to its customers. A summary of Federal-Mogul's primary independent competitors by its businesses is set forth below.

• | Powertrain. Primary competitors include AGM Automotive, Art Metal, Bergmann, BinZou, Bleistahl, Bosch, Daido, Dana, Dana-Reinz, Delfingen, Denso, DongYang, ElringKlinger, FNOK, Freudenberg, Kaco/Sabo, Kolbenschmidt, Mahle, Miba, NGK, NOK, NPR, Relats, Sinteron, SKF, Taiho, and Vitrica.


• | Motorparts. Primary competitors include Akebono Brake Corporation, Autolite, Brake Parts Inc., Bosch Group, Centric Parts, Crowne Group LLC, Delphi Automotive LLP, Denso Corporation, Dorman Products, Inc., GRI Engineering and Development LLC (MAT Holdings, Inc.), Mahle GmbH, Mevotech Inc., NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd., NTN Bearing Corporation, Neapco Inc., Old World Industries, LLC, Phillips Industries, Pylon Manufacturing Corporation, Rain-X (ITW Global Brands), SKF Group, Osram Sylvania Ltd., The Timken Company, Valeo Group, Dana Corporation (Victor Reinz brand), and ZF TRW Automotive Holdings Corp.

  IEH Auto and Pep Boys operate in a highly competitive environment. IEH Auto and Pep Boys encounter competition from national and regional chains, automotive dealerships and from local independent service providers and merchants. Their 
7

competitors include general, full range and discount department stores and online retailers which carry automotive parts and accessories and/or have automotive service centers, as well as specialized automotive retailers. IEH Auto and Pep Boys believe that their operations in both DIFM and DIY differentiate them from most of their competitors. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Federal-Mogul purchases various raw materials and component parts for use in its manufacturing processes, including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, non-metallic raw materials, stampings, castings and forgings. Federal-Mogul has not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials, components or finished parts and normally does not carry inventories of raw materials or finished parts in excess of those reasonably required to meet its production and shipping schedules. Federal-Mogul, along with IEH Auto and Pep Boys, also purchase parts manufactured by other manufacturers for sale in the aftermarket. 
In 2016, no outside supplier of Federal-Mogul provided products that accounted for more than 5% of Federal-Mogul’s annual purchases. 
In 2016, IEH Auto's ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 57% of the merchandise purchased. Federal-Mogul is a supplier to IEH Auto and individually accounted for 13% of the merchandise purchased.
Historically, Pep Boys purchased a significant portion of its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. During 2016, Pep Boys' ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 47% of the merchandise purchased. Only one of Pep Boys' suppliers accounted for more than 10% of its purchases. Federal-Mogul is a supplier to Pep Boys. 
Seasonality
Federal-Mogul’s business is moderately seasonal because many North American OE customers typically close assembly plants for two weeks in July for model year changeovers, and for an additional week during the December holiday season. OE customers in Europe historically shut down vehicle production during portions of July and August and one week in December. Shut-down periods in the Rest of World generally vary by country. Our Automotive segments' aftermarket business experiences seasonal fluctuations in sales due to demands caused by weather and driving patterns. Historically, Federal-Mogul’s sales and operating profits have been the strongest in the second quarter.
In addition, IEH Auto's sales and operating profits have been the strongest in the second quarter. Pep Boys' sales and operating profits are earned evenly throughout the year.
Environmental Regulations
Our Automotive segments' operations, consistent with those of the manufacturing sector in general, are subject to numerous existing and proposed laws and governmental regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly regarding plant wastes and emissions and solid waste disposal. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment for environmental control activities did not have a material impact on our Automotive segments' financial position or cash flows in 2016 and are not expected to have a material impact on its financial position or cash flows in 2017.
Intellectual Property
Federal-Mogul holds in excess of 6,300 patents and patent applications on a worldwide basis, of which more than 1,200 have been filed in the United States. Of the approximately 6,300 patents and patent applications, approximately 30% are in production use and/or are licensed to third parties, and the remaining 70% are being considered for future production use or provide a strategic technological benefit to Federal-Mogul.
Federal-Mogul does not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect its business. Federal-Mogul’s current patents expire over various periods into the year 2036. Federal-Mogul is actively introducing and patenting new technology to replace formerly patented technology before the expiration of the existing patents.

8

unionized manufacturing facilities have their own contracts with their own expiration dates, and as a result, no contract expiration date affects more than one facility. 
 Neither IEH Auto nor Pep Boys had any union employees.
Energy
Background
We conduct our Energy segment through our majority ownership in CVR. We acquired a controlling interest in CVR on May 4, 2012. 
CVR is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing industries through its holdings in CVR Refining, LP (“CVR Refining”) and CVR Partners, LP (“CVR Partners”), respectively. CVR Refining is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. CVR Partners produces nitrogen fertilizers in the form of urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN") and ammonia. As of December 31, 2016, CVR owned 100% of the general partners of CVR Refining and CVR Partners and approximately 66% of the outstanding common units of CVR Refining and 34% of the outstanding common units of CVR Partners. 
On April 1, 2016, CVR Partners completed the East Dubuque Merger as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 9, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement"), whereby CVR Partners acquired CVR Nitrogen and CVR Nitrogen GP. Refer to Note 1, "Description of Business and Basis of Presentation - Acquisitions of Businesses," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this merger.
On August 2, 2016, we sold 250,000 common units of CVR Refining. As a result of this transaction, we and our affiliates collectively own 69.99% of CVR. Pursuant to CVR Refining’s partnership agreement, in certain circumstances, the general partner of CVR Refining has the right to purchase all, but not less than all, of CVR Refining's common units held by unaffiliated unit holders at a price not less than their then-current market price, as calculated pursuant to the terms of such partnership agreement (the “Call Right”). Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement, because our holdings were reduced to less than 70.0%, the ownership threshold for the application of such Call Right was permanently reduced from 95% to 80%. Accordingly, if at any time the general partner of CVR Refining and its affiliates owns more than 80% of CVR Refining's common units, it will have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise such Call Right.
CVR is a reporting company under the Exchange Act and files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC that are publicly available.
As of December 31, 2016, Icahn Enterprises owned 82.0% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we directly owned approximately 3.9% of the total outstanding common units of CVR Refining.
Petroleum Business 
The petroleum business consists of our and CVR's interest in CVR Refining. 
CVR's petroleum business includes a 115,000 barrels per calendar day ("bpcd") rated capacity complex full coking medium-sour crude oil refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas and a 70,000 bpcd rated capacity complex crude oil refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. The combined crude capacity represents approximately 22% of the region's refining capacity. The Coffeyville refinery located in southeast Kansas is approximately 100 miles from Cushing, Oklahoma ("Cushing"), a major crude oil trading and storage hub. The Wynnewood refinery is located approximately 65 miles south of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and approximately 130 miles from Cushing.
The petroleum business also includes the following auxiliary operating assets:

• | Crude Oil Gathering System. The petroleum business owns and operates a crude oil gathering system serving Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado and Texas. The gathering system includes approximately 340 miles of active owned and leased pipelines and approximately 150 crude oil transports and associated storage facilities, which allows it to gather crude oils from independent crude oil producers. The crude oil gathering system has a gathering capacity of over 70,000 barrels per day ("bpd"). Gathered crude oil provides an attractive and competitive base supply of crude oil for the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries. During 2016, the petroleum business gathered an average of approximately 71,000 bpd. 


• | Pipelines and Storage Tanks. The petroleum business owns a proprietary pipeline system capable of transporting approximately 170,000 bpd of crude oil from its Broome Station facility located near Caney, Kansas to its Coffeyville refinery. Crude oils sourced outside of the proprietary gathering system are delivered by common carrier pipelines into various terminals in Cushing, where they are blended and then delivered to the Broome 

9

Station tank farm via a pipeline owned by Plains Pipeline L.P. ("Plains"). The petroleum business owns approximately (i) 1.5 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity that supports the gathering system and the Coffeyville refinery, (ii) 0.9 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity at the Wynnewood refinery and (iii) 1.5 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity in Cushing. The petroleum business also leases additional crude oil storage capacity of approximately (iv) 2.2 million barrels in Cushing, (v) 0.2 million barrels in Duncan, Oklahoma and (vi) 0.1 million barrels at the Wynnewood refinery. In addition to crude oil storage, the petroleum business owns over 4.5 million barrels of combined refined products and feedstocks storage capacity.
Crude and Feedstock Supply
The Coffeyville refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from heavy sour to light sweet crude oil. Currently, the Coffeyville refinery crude oil slate consists of a blend of mid-continent domestic grades and various Canadian medium and heavy sours, and it has recently introduced North Dakota Bakken and other similarly sourced crudes into its crude slate. While crude oil has historically constituted over 90% of the Coffeyville refinery's total throughput over the last five years, other feedstock inputs include normal butane, natural gasoline, alkylation feeds, naphtha, gas oil and vacuum tower bottoms.
The Wynnewood refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from medium sour to light sweet crude oil, although isobutane, gasoline components, and normal butane are also typically used. Historically most of the Wynnewood refinery's crude oil has been acquired domestically, mainly from Texas and Oklahoma, but the refinery can also access and process various light and medium Canadian grades.
Crude oil is supplied to the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries through the wholly-owned gathering system and by pipeline. The petroleum business has continued to increase the number of barrels of crude oil supplied through its crude oil gathering system in 2016 and it now has the capacity of supplying over 70,000 bpd of crude oil to the refineries. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the gathering system supplied approximately 41% and 34% of the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries' crude oil demand, respectively.
Crude Oil Supply Agreement
On August 31, 2012, Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing, LLC ("CRRM") and Vitol Inc. ("Vitol") entered into an Amended and Restated Crude Oil Supply Agreement (as amended, the "Vitol Agreement"). Under the Vitol Agreement, Vitol supplies the petroleum business with crude oil and intermediation logistics, which helps the petroleum business to reduce its inventory position and mitigate crude oil pricing risk. The Vitol Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms (each such term, a "Renewal Term") unless either party provides the other with notice of nonrenewal at least 180 days prior to expiration of any Renewal Term. The Vitol Agreement currently extends through December 31, 2017.
Marketing and Distribution
The petroleum business focuses its Coffeyville petroleum product marketing efforts in the central mid-continent area, because of its relative proximity to the refinery and pipeline access. Coffeyville also has access to the Rocky Mountain area. Coffeyville engages in rack marketing, which is the supply of product through tanker trucks directly to customers located in close geographic proximity to the refinery and to customers at throughput terminals on the refined products distribution systems of Magellan and NuStar. Coffeyville also makes bulk sales (sales into third-party pipelines) into the mid-continent markets and other destinations utilizing the product pipeline networks owned by Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. ("Magellan"), Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and NuStar Energy, L.P. The outbound Enterprise Pipeline Red Line provides Coffeyville with access to the NuStar Refined Products Pipeline system. This allows gasoline and ULSD product sales from Kansas up into North Dakota.
The Wynnewood refinery ships its finished product via pipeline, railcar, and truck. It focuses its efforts in the southern portion of the Magellan system which covers all of Oklahoma, parts of Arkansas as well as eastern Missouri, and all other Magellan terminals. The pipeline system is also able to flow in the opposite direction, providing access to Texas markets as well as some adjoining states with pipeline connections. Wynnewood also sells jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense via its segregated truck rack and can offer asphalts, solvents and other specialty products via both truck and rail.
Customers
Customers for the refined petroleum products primarily include retailers, railroads, and farm cooperatives and other refiners/marketers in Group 3 of the PADD II region because of their relative proximity to the refineries and pipeline access. The petroleum business sells bulk products to long-standing customers at spot market prices based on a Group 3 basis differential to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), which are reported by industry market-related indices such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service.
The petroleum business also has a rack marketing business supplying product through tanker trucks directly to customers located in proximity to the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries, as well as to customers located at throughput terminals on 
10

refined products distribution systems run by Magellan and NuStar. Rack sales are at posted prices that are influenced by competitor pricing and Group 3 spot market differentials. Additionally, the Wynnewood refinery supplies jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the two largest customers accounted for approximately 15% and 10% of the petroleum business net sales and approximately 54% of the petroleum business net sales were made to its ten largest customers.
Competition
The petroleum business competes primarily on the basis of price, reliability of supply, availability of multiple grades of products and location. The principal competitive factors affecting its refining operations are cost of crude oil and other feedstock costs, refinery complexity, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix and product distribution and transportation costs. The location of the refineries provides the petroleum business with a reliable supply of crude oil and a transportation cost advantage over its competitors. The petroleum business primarily competes against five refineries operated in the mid-continent region. In addition to these refineries, the refineries compete against trading companies, as well as other refineries located outside the region that are linked to the mid-continent market through an extensive product pipeline system. These competitors include refineries located near the Gulf Coast and the Texas panhandle region. The petroleum business refinery competition also includes branded, integrated and independent oil refining companies, such as Phillips 66 Company, HollyFrontier Corporation, CHS Inc., Valero Energy Corporation and Flint Hills Resources LLC.
Seasonality
The petroleum business experiences seasonal effects as demand for gasoline products is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and road construction work. Demand for diesel fuel is higher during the planting and harvesting seasons. As a result, the petroleum business' results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower compared to its results for the second and third calendar quarters. In addition, unseasonably cool weather in the summer months and/or unseasonably warm weather in the winter months in the markets in which the petroleum business sells its petroleum products can impact the demand for gasoline and diesel fuel. The demand for asphalt is also seasonal and is generally higher during the months of March through October.
Nitrogen Fertilizer Business
CVR's nitrogen fertilizer business consists of two nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities which are located in Coffeyville, Kansas and East Dubuque, Illinois. The nitrogen fertilizer business produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. The principal products are UAN and ammonia, and all products are sold on a wholesale basis. The East Dubuque facility has the flexibility to vary its product mix enabling the East Dubuque facility to upgrade a portion of its ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, nitric acid and liquid and granulated urea each season, depending on market demand, pricing and storage availability. The East Dubuque facility's product sales are heavily weighted toward sales of ammonia and UAN.
Raw Material Supply
The Coffeyville fertilizer facility was built in 2000 and uses a gasification process to convert pet coke to high purity hydrogen for subsequent conversion to ammonia. The Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer facility's pet coke gasification process results in a significantly higher percentage of fixed costs than a natural gas-based fertilizer plant. During the past five years, over 70% of the Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer facility's pet coke requirements on average were supplied by CVR Refining's adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to a renewable long-term agreement. Historically the Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer plant has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements from third parties such as other Midwestern refineries or pet coke brokers at spot-prices. CVR Partners is party to a pet coke supply agreement with HollyFrontier Corporation. The term of this agreement expires in December 2017 and historically has been renewed annually. If necessary, there are other pet coke suppliers and the gasification process can be modified to operate on coal as an alternative, which provides an additional raw material source. There are significant supplies of coal within a 60-mile radius of the Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer plant. 
The East Dubuque facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer, primarily ammonia and UAN. The East Dubuque facility is able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to the plant’s connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and the ANR Pipeline Company pipeline. The pipelines are connected to Nicor Inc.’s distribution system at the Chicago Citygate receipt point and at the Hampshire interconnect, respectively, from which natural gas is transported to the facility. Though the East Dubuque facility does not typically purchase natural gas for the purpose of resale, it may occasionally sell natural gas when purchase commitments exceed production requirements and/or storage capacities, or when the margin from selling natural gas significantly exceeds the margin from producing additional ammonia. The East Dubuque nitrogen fertilizer facility’s receipt point locations and access to the Chicago Citygate receipt point has allowed it to obtain relatively favorable natural gas prices for sales of excess natural gas due to its proximity to the stable residential demand for the commodity in Chicago, Illinois. 
11

Distribution, Sales and Marketing
The primary geographic markets for the nitrogen fertilizer business' fertilizer products are Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Texas. The nitrogen fertilizer business primarily markets the UAN products to agricultural customers and the ammonia products to agricultural and industrial customers.
UAN and ammonia are distributed by truck or by railcar. If delivered by truck, products are sold on a freight-on-board basis, and freight is normally arranged by the customer. The nitrogen fertilizer business leases and owns a fleet of railcars for use in product delivery, and, if delivered by railcar, the products are most commonly sold on a FOB destination point basis and the nitrogen fertilizer business typically arranges the freight. 
The East Dubuque facility is located in northwest Illinois, in the corn belt. The East Dubuque nitrogen fertilizer facility primarily sells its product to customers located within 200 miles of the facility. In most instances, customers take delivery of nitrogen products at the East Dubuque nitrogen fertilizer facility and arrange and pay to transport them to their final destinations by truck. The East Dubuque nitrogen fertilizer facility has direct access to a barge dock on the Mississippi River as well as a nearby rail spur serviced by the Canadian National Railway Company.
The nitrogen fertilizer business offers agricultural products on a spot, forward or prepay basis and often uses forward sales of fertilizer products to optimize its asset utilization, planning process and production scheduling. These sales are made by offering customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates that it proposes. The nitrogen fertilizer business uses this program to varying degrees during the year and between years depending on market conditions. Fixing the selling prices of nitrogen fertilizer products months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes the nitrogen fertilizer business reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment.
Customers
The nitrogen fertilizer business sells UAN products to retailers and distributors. In addition, it sells ammonia to agricultural and industrial customers. Given the nature of its business, and consistent with industry practice, the nitrogen fertilizer business does not have long-term minimum purchase contracts with its UAN and ammonia customers.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the top five customers of the nitrogen fertilizer business in the aggregate represented 32% of the nitrogen fertilizer business' net sales. The nitrogen fertilizer business' top two customers accounted for approximately each accounted for 10% of the nitrogen fertilizer business' net sales.
Competition
The nitrogen fertilizer business has experienced and expect to continue to meet significant levels of competition from current and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. Competition in the nitrogen fertilizer industry is dominated by price considerations. However, during the spring and fall application seasons, farming activities intensify and delivery capacity is a significant competitive factor. The nitrogen fertilizer business maintains a large fleet of leased and owned railcars and seasonally adjusts inventory to enhance its manufacturing and distribution operations.
The nitrogen fertilizer business' major competitors include Agrium, Inc.; CF Industries Holdings, Inc., including its majority owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen Company, LP.; Koch Nitrogen Company, LLC; and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc. Domestic competition is intense due to customers' sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. The nitrogen fertilizer business also encounters competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments.
Seasonality
Because the nitrogen fertilizer business primarily sells agricultural commodity products, its business is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the agricultural industry. As a result, the nitrogen fertilizer business typically generates greater net sales in the first half of each calendar year, which is referred to as the planting season, and its net sales tend to be lower during the second half of each calendar year, which is referred to as the fill season. In addition, the demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers who make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest. The specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like crop prices, the farmers' current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted.
Environmental Matters
CVR's petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances 
12

into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water, the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and nitrogen products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. These laws and regulations, their underlying regulatory requirements and the enforcement thereof impact the petroleum business and operations and the nitrogen fertilizer business and operations by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | the need to obtain and comply with permits, licenses and authorizations;


• | requirements for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and liability for off-site waste disposal locations; and


• | specifications for the products marketed by the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business, primarily gasoline, diesel fuel, UAN and ammonia.

CVR's operations require numerous permits, licenses and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of CVR's permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which CVR is subject are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. The ultimate impact on CVR's compliance with evolving laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that its operations may change over time and certain implementing regulations for laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act, have not yet been finalized, are under governmental or judicial review or are being revised. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.
Renewable Fuel Standards
Refer to Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Energy," If sufficient renewable identification numbers ("RINs") are unavailable for purchase, if the petroleum business has to pay a significantly higher price for RINs or if the petroleum business is otherwise unable to meet the United States Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") RFS mandates, the petroleum business' financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies-Energy," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of Renewable Fuel Standards ("RFS") of the EPA. 
Safety, Health and Security Matters
CVR is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. CVR is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.
CVR operates a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. CVR has developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite CVR's efforts to achieve excellence in its safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. CVR routinely audits its programs and consider improvements in its management systems.
The Wynnewood refinery has been the subject of a number of OSHA inspections since 2006. As a result of these inspections, the Wynnewood refinery entered into four OSHA settlement agreements in 2008, pursuant to which it has agreed to undertake certain studies, conduct abatement activities, and revise and enhance certain OSHA compliance programs. The remaining costs associated with implementing these studies, abatement activities and program revisions are not expected to exceed $1 million.
Refer to Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies-Energy," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of OSHA matters related to the Wynnewood refinery boiler explosion. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, our Energy segment had approximately 1,500 employees.
As of December 31, 2016, approximately 52% and 31% of the employees at CVR Refining and CVR Partners, respectively, were covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
13

Railcar
Background
We conduct our Railcar segment through our majority ownership interests in American Railcar Industries, Inc. ("ARI") and our wholly owned subsidiary American Railcar Leasing, LLC ("ARL"). As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 62.2% of the total outstanding common stock of ARI.
Prior to February 29, 2016, we owned a 75% economic interest in ARL. On February 29, 2016, Icahn Enterprises entered into a contribution agreement with an affiliate of Mr. Icahn, to acquire the remaining 25% economic interest in ARL not already owned by us. Pursuant to this contribution agreement, we contributed 685,367 newly issued depositary units of Icahn Enterprises in exchange for the remaining 25% economic interest in ARL. As a result of the transaction, we own a 100% economic interest in ARL. This transaction was authorized by the independent committee of the board of directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises. The independent committee was advised by independent counsel and retained an independent financial advisor which rendered a fairness opinion. On October 2, 2013, we acquired the initial 75% economic interest in the newly capitalized ARL from an affiliate of Mr. Icahn. ARL was considered an entity under common control that required us to consolidate the financial results of ARL on an as-if-pooling basis. 
On December 19, 2016, Icahn Enterprises entered into a definitive agreement to sell ARL to SMBC Rail Services LLC ("SMBC Rail"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, for cash based on (i) a value approximately $2.8 billion (subject to certain adjustments) and (ii) a fleet of approximately 29,000 railcars. The initial closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2017. For a period of three years thereafter, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, the sellers will have an option to sell, and SMBC Rail will have an option to buy, approximately 4,800 additional railcars. These approximately 4,800 railcars will be segregated and owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. If the conditions to the option are satisfied, the purchase price for the approximately 4,800 additional railcars would be approximately $586 million at the time of the initial closing, which would bring the total sale price to approximately $3.4 billion (subject to certain adjustments). The sale is subject to customary closing conditions. Neither the sale nor the option are subject to any financing condition.

Gaming
Background 
We conduct our Gaming segment through our majority ownership in Tropicana Entertainment Inc. ("Tropicana"), and as discussed below, effective February 26, 2016, our wholly owned subsidiary, Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. ("TER") which owns the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort (the "Trump Taj Mahal"). The Trump Taj Mahal closed and ceased its casino and hotel operations on October 10, 2016.
Tropicana is a reporting company under the Exchange Act and files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC that are publicly available.
As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 72.5% of the total outstanding common stock of Tropicana.
On September 9, 2014, TER and its subsidiaries filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington, Delaware. On February 26, 2016 (the "Effective Date"), TER emerged from bankruptcy. Icahn Enterprises was the sole holder of TER's senior secured debt. On the Effective Date, among other things, the existing pre-petition senior secured debt held by Icahn Enterprises was extinguished and converted into 100% of TER’s New Common Stock (as defined in the bankruptcy plan). As a result, we became the 100% owner of TER after reorganization and accordingly, obtained control and began consolidating the results of TER on February 26, 2016. TER owns the Trump Taj Mahal which closed and ceased its casino and hotel operations on October 10, 2016.

Competition
Our Gaming segment owns land-based and riverboat casino facilities in six states and one hotel, timeshare and casino resort located on the island of Aruba. Our Gaming segment competes with numerous casinos and casino hotels of varying quality and size in the markets in which its properties are located and with other forms of legalized gaming, including internet gaming, state-sponsored lotteries, racetracks, off-track wagering, video lottery, video poker terminals and card parlors. Our Gaming segment also competes with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, and with various other entertainment businesses. The casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably by their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity.
In most markets, our Gaming segment competes directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas, including casinos located on Native American reservations. In some markets, our Gaming segment faces competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within its market areas.
Our Gaming segment believes competition in existing markets has intensified over the last several years, due to new markets opening for development, new properties opening in existing markets, and challenging economic conditions in certain markets. Many casino operators have invested in expanding existing facilities, developing new facilities, and acquiring established facilities in existing markets. The expansion of casino entertainment at existing properties, the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors has increased competition in many markets in which our Gaming segment competes, and it expects this intense competition to continue. 
Our Gaming segment's operating results can be adversely affected by costs associated with advertising, promotions and complimentary services to patrons, the amount and timing of which may be affected by the advertising and complimentary policies and actions of its properties' competitors and its efforts to keep pace with them. If our Gaming segment's operating revenues are insufficient to allow it to match the promotions of competitors, the number of its casino patrons may decline, which may have a material adverse effect on our Gaming segment's financial performance. In addition, some of Gaming segment's competitors have significantly greater financial resources than it does, and as a result our Gaming segment may not be able to successfully compete with them in the future.
Trademarks
Our Gaming segment uses a variety of trade names, service marks and trademarks and has all the rights and licenses necessary to conduct its continuing operations. Our Gaming segment has registered several service marks and trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or otherwise acquired the licenses to use those which are material to the conduct of its business. Tropicana owns the following federally registered trademarks or service marks that are material to its business: MontBleu, Aztar, Trop, Tropicana, Belle of Baton Rouge, Trop Advantage, the Quarter at Tropicana and Lumiére.
Tropicana Trademarks
Tropicana along with certain entities that own Tropicana Las Vegas (“Tropicana LV”) are parties to a trademark Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) governing the respective rights of the parties to the “Tropicana” trademark. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, which became effective on September 28, 2011, the Tropicana LV entities, subject to certain advertising exceptions and other terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement, have perpetual exclusive rights to use the names, trademarks, and/or service marks (the “Marks”) TROPICANA LAS VEGAS (or TROP LAS VEGAS) and TROPICANA LV (or TROP LV) (the “TLV Marks”, as defined in the Settlement Agreement) in conjunction with its services (“Services”, as defined in the Settlement Agreement) in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada and within a 50-mile radius of the front entrance of the Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino located at 3801 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada (the “TLV Territory”) along with certain rights to use the TLV Marks on the Internet without geographic limitation and to register the TLV Marks as domain names. Tropicana and its affiliates, subject to certain advertising exceptions and other terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement, have perpetual exclusive worldwide rights (excluding the TLV Territory) to use the TROPICANA and TROP Marks coupled with either a pre-existing identifier of its Services (such as "TROPICANA ENTERTAINMENT" or "TROP ADVANTAGE") or an accurate geographic identifier of the location of a Tropicana Entertainment property (other than LAS VEGAS or the name of any city within the TLV Territory) (the “TE Marks”) along with certain rights to use the TE Marks on the Internet without geographic limitation and to register the TE Marks as domain names.

Seasonality
Our Gaming segment's cash flows from operating activities are seasonal in nature. Operating results are traditionally the strongest in the third quarter and traditionally the weakest during the fourth quarter. Any excess cash flows achieved from operations during the peak seasons are used to subsidize non-peak seasons. Performance in non-peak seasons is usually dependent on favorable weather and a long-weekend holiday calendar. In the event that our Gaming segment is not able to generate excess cash flows during the peak seasons, it may not be able to fully subsidize non-peak seasons.
Governmental Regulation 
The ownership and operation of Gaming segment's facilities are subject to pervasive regulation under the laws and regulations of each of the six states in which it operates as well as in Aruba where Tropicana operates a small casino. Gaming laws generally are based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenues derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on the gaming industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and fitness.
Typically, a jurisdiction's regulatory environment is established by statute and is administered by a regulatory agency with broad discretion to regulate, among other things, the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. 
Licensing
Gaming laws require our Gaming segment and certain of its subsidiaries, as well as its directors, officers (with respect to corporations), managers (with respect to limited liability companies), and certain other key employees and, in some cases, certain of its shareholders (with respect to corporations), members (with respect to limited liability companies), and holders of debt securities, to obtain licenses, findings of suitability or other approvals from gaming authorities. Licenses or findings of suitability typically require a determination that the applicant is suitable or otherwise qualified to hold the license or the finding of suitability necessary to hold equity, debt securities or position with the gaming licensee or its affiliated entities. Where not mandated by statute, rule or regulation, gaming authorities generally have broad discretion in determining who must come forward for suitability and whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable or otherwise qualified.
Other Regulations
Our Gaming segment is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, currency transactions, employees, taxation, zoning and building codes, marketing and advertising, vessels and permanently moored craft. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect Tropicana's business. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, Tropicana had approximately 7,000 employees and had collective bargaining agreements with several unions covering approximately 2,600 of those employees, substantially all of whom are employed at Tropicana AC, Lumiére Place Casino, Belle of Baton Rouge and Tropicana Evansville.
As of December 31, 2016, TER had approximately 179 employees.

Metals
Background
We conduct our Metals segment through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, PSC Metals, Inc. (“PSC Metals”). 
PSC Metals is principally engaged in the business of collecting, processing and selling ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as the processing and distribution of steel pipe and plate products. PSC Metals collects industrial and obsolete scrap metal, processes it into reusable forms, and supplies the recycled metals to its customers, including electric-arc furnace mills, integrated steel mills, foundries, secondary smelters and metals brokers. These services are provided through PSC Metals' recycling facilities located in seven states. PSC Metals also operates a steel products business that includes the supply of secondary plate and structural grade pipe that is sold into niche markets for counterweights, piling and foundations, construction materials and infrastructure end-markets.
17

The Ferrous Scrap Metal Business
PSC Metals' ferrous products include busheling, plate and structural, shredded, sheared and bundled scrap metal and other purchased scrap metal such as turnings (steel machining fragments), cast furnace iron and broken furnace iron. PSC Metals processes the scrap into a size, density and purity required by customers to meet their production needs.
PSC Metals purchases processed and unprocessed ferrous scrap metal from various sources, including individuals and traditional scrap yards as well as industrial manufacturers who recycle the scrap from their metal-forming processes and steel mills who look to PSC Metals to remarket secondary product they would otherwise scrap. PSC Metals sets the price paid to its suppliers based on market factors such as the demand and price for processed material and the underlying metal content of the scrap material being purchased. Changes in scrap prices could cause the collection rates of scrap to increase (when prices are higher) or decrease (when prices are lower). The variation in prices and collection rates can have a significant effect on sales volumes through PSC Metals' scrap yards. Scrap material is processed in PSC Metals' recycling yards where it is shredded, cut, broken, sheared, sorted and classified for use as raw material in the steel-making process. PSC Metals then sells processed ferrous scrap to end-users such as steel producing mini-mills and integrated steel makers and foundries, as well as brokers who aggregate materials for other large users. Additionally, a significant amount of valuable, non-ferrous metal is also recovered as a by-product of the shredding process, which is sold separately as discussed below.
The Non-ferrous Scrap Metal Business
The primary non-ferrous commodities that PSC Metals recycles are aluminum, copper, brass, stainless steel and other nickel-bearing metals. Non-ferrous products are a significant raw material in the production of aluminum and copper alloys used in manufacturing. The geographic markets for non-ferrous scrap tend to be larger than those for ferrous scrap due to the higher selling prices of non-ferrous metals relative to their weight, which justify the cost of shipping over greater distances. Non-ferrous scrap is typically sold on a spot basis, either directly or through brokers, to intermediate or end-users, which include smelters, foundries and aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers. Prices for non-ferrous scrap are driven by demand for finished non-ferrous metal goods and by the general level of economic activity, with prices generally related to the price of the primary metal on the London Metals Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the New York Commodity Exchange.
Strategy
PSC Metals is focused on growing and diversifying its core ferrous business by improving operating efficiencies through better use of its assets, lowering its cost structure and continuing to expand its non-ferrous business through both acquisitions and organic growth. PSC Metals seeks to acquire companies that will enable it to increase and maintain a consistent supply of scrap and capture efficiencies associated with an appropriate level of vertical integration.
Raw Materials/Competition
The scrap metal recycling industry is highly competitive, cyclical in nature, and commodity-based. Operating results tend to reflect and be amplified by changes in general global economic conditions, which in turn drive domestic and overseas manufacturing and the consumption of scrap in the production of steel and foundry products. The demand for product and production activity of PSC Metals' scrap consumers drives market pricing levels in PSC Metals' ferrous and non-ferrous scrap sales. Demand is driven by mill production schedules related to regional manufacturing requirements and service center stocking levels. Due to the lower selling prices of ferrous metals relative to their weight, raw ferrous scrap is generally purchased locally. Ferrous scrap prices are local and regional in nature. Where there are overlapping regional markets, however, prices do not tend to differ significantly between the regions due to the ability of companies to ship scrap metal from one region to another. The most significant limitation on the size of the geographic market for the procurement of ferrous scrap is transportation cost. This leads to significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for PSC Metals' products. The steel products business is less cyclical but is affected by the rate of secondary product generated by steel mills generating these products and the market demands in plate and pipe markets.
Customers
Our Metals segment had two customers in 2016 that represented approximately 25% of its net sales, one of which individually accounted for approximately 18% of its net sales. No other customer accounted for more than 7% of our Metals segment's net sales in 2016.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, PSC Metals had 534 employees, of which 91 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Mining
Background
We conduct our Mining segment through our majority ownership in Ferrous Resources Ltd ("Ferrous Resources"). As discussed below, we obtained control of and consolidated the results of Ferrous Resources during the second quarter of 2015.
Ferrous Resources acquired certain rights to iron ore mineral resources in Brazil and develops mining operations and related infrastructure to produce and sell iron ore products to the global steel industry. Ferrous Resources has acquired significant iron ore assets in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, known as Viga, Viga Norte, Esperança, Serrinha and Santanense. In addition, Ferrous Resources has acquired certain mineral rights near Jacuípe in the State of Bahia, Brazil. Of the assets acquired, Viga, Esperança and Santanense are already extracting and producing iron ore, while the other assets are at an early stage of exploration.
In response to the depressed iron ore price environment, Ferrous Resources decided to temporarily suspend Esperança's and Santanense's operations in the first quarter of 2015 in order to study alternatives to further reduce cost of production and improve product quality and therefore to improve profitability and margin per metric ton. 
Acquisition
On April 25, 2015 we entered into an agreement which provided that we would launch a tender offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding shares of Ferrous Resources for $0.36 per share and backstop a certain rights offering of up to $40 million. 
Prior to the tender offer, we owned approximately 14.1% of the total outstanding shares of Ferrous Resources. As a result of the tender offer, we obtained control of Ferrous Resources through the purchase of additional shares of Ferrous Resources on June 8, 2015 (the acquisition date), and additional shares of Ferrous Resources on June 26, 2015 for a combined aggregate tender consideration of $180 million. In addition, on June 26, 2015, pursuant to a certain rights offering, we purchased additional shares of Ferrous Resources for an aggregate consideration of $29 million. 
As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 77.2% of the total outstanding common stock of Ferrous Resources.
Strategy
The economic viability of Ferrous Resources' business is highly dependent on the market price of iron ore. Ferrous Resources' longer-term strategy is to produce and sell iron ore products in the domestic Brazilian market, as well as to the export markets, principally China, Japan, Korea, the Middle East and also potentially Europe. Future revenues will depend on Brazilian and global demand levels for iron ore, iron ore international sales prices, the type of iron ore product it sells and the iron content of those products. Iron ore prices (including sale prices in Brazil) are largely driven by global demand for crude steel, the primary driver for iron ore demand.
For Ferrous Resources, the key performance driver has historically been from demand for raw materials from Chinese steelmakers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Ferrous Resources has been concentrating on sales in Brazil, where the best margins are being captured. During 2016, both domestic and global steel industries showed stability on low to mid prices as steel mills' utilization rates have not recovered and iron ore prices remain weak. 
Competition
The iron ore industry is characterized by intense competition and a high level of market concentration. Ferrous Resources competes with a number of large international mining companies, many of which have mineral and financial resources substantially greater than those of Ferrous Resources. 
Customers
Ferrous Resources currently sells its products in the domestic Brazilian market to three main customers, one of which accounted for 67% of our Mining segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, Ferrous Resources had 988 employees.
Food Packaging
Background
We conduct our Food Packaging segment through our majority ownership in Viskase Companies, Inc. ("Viskase"). As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 74.6% of the total outstanding common stock of Viskase.
19

Business
Viskase is a worldwide leader in the production and sale of cellulosic, fibrous and plastic casings for the processed meat and poultry industry. Viskase currently operates ten manufacturing facilities, six distribution centers and three service centers throughout North America, Europe, South America and Asia. Viskase provides value-added support services relating to these products for some of the world's largest global consumer products companies. Viskase believes it is one of the two largest worldwide producers of non-edible cellulosic casings for processed meats and one of the three largest manufacturers of non-edible fibrous casings. 
Business Strategy
Viskase's business strategy is to continue to improve operational efficiencies, product quality and throughput by upgrading existing production facilities and adding resources in high growth markets through new capital investments. Viskase has been successful in implementing production cost-savings initiatives and will continue to pursue similar opportunities that enhance its profitability and competitive positioning as a leader in the casing market. Opportunities to reduce extrusion, shirring and printing waste are also feasible at several of Viskase's facilities through upgraded equipment and an ongoing effort to redefine product mix. 
International
As of December 31, 2016, Viskase had eight manufacturing or finishing facilities located outside the continental United States: Monterrey, Mexico; Beauvais, France; Thâon-les-Vosges, France; Caronno, Italy; Warsaw, Poland; Swiecie, Poland; Clark Freeport Zone, Philippines; and Atibaia, Brazil. Viskase continues to explore opportunities to expand in emerging markets. Net sales from customers located outside the United States represented approximately 70% of its total net sales in 2016. Viskase's operations in France are responsible for distributing products, directly or through distributors, in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. While overall consumption of processed meat products in North America and Western Europe is stable, market growth is driven by increasing demand in Eastern Europe, South America and the Asia Pacific region. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, Viskase had 1,931 employees worldwide, of which 437 employees were covered under collective bargaining agreements.
Real Estate
Background
Our Real Estate operations consist of rental real estate, property development and associated club activities. 
Our rental real estate operations consist primarily of office and industrial properties leased to single corporate tenants. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 15 commercial rental real estate properties. Historically, substantially all of our real estate assets leased to others have been net-leased under long-term leases. With certain exceptions, these tenants are required to pay all expenses relating to the leased property and, therefore, we are typically not responsible for payment of expenses, including maintenance, utilities, taxes, insurance or any capital items associated with such properties.
Our property development operations are run primarily through Bayswater Development LLC, a real estate investment, management and development subsidiary that focuses primarily on the construction and sale of single-family and multi-family homes, lots in subdivisions and planned communities and raw land for residential development. Our New Seabury development property in Cape Cod, Massachusetts and our Grand Harbor development property in Vero Beach, Florida include land for future residential development of approximately 272 and 1,128 units of residential housing, respectively. Both our developments operate golf and club operations as well. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold the Oak Harbor development and operations in Vero Beach, Florida, which was historically operated as part of the Grand Harbor development property. Our long-term investment horizon and operational expertise allow us to acquire properties with limited current income and complex entitlement and development issues. 
In addition, our Real Estate segment owns an unfinished development property and a partially developed casino, located on approximately 23 acres in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Strategy
Our Real Estate business strategy is based on our long-term investment outlook. We maximize the value of our commercial lease portfolio through effective management of existing properties and disposal of assets on an opportunistic basis. We continue to market our remaining residential product and to build new homes as market conditions warrant. In keeping with the Real Estate business' strategy of investing capital to grow existing operations, we actively pursue prudent acquisitions of additional commercial and residential properties at favorable prospective returns.
20

Seasonality
Resort operations are highly seasonal with peak activity in Cape Cod from June to September and in Florida from November to March. Sales activity for our real estate developments in Cape Cod typically peak in late winter and early spring, while in Florida our peak selling season is during the winter months.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, our Real Estate segment had 146 employees. No employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Home Fashion
Background
We conduct our Home Fashion segment through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, WestPoint Home LLC (“WPH”).
We acquired a controlling interest in WestPoint International, Inc. ("WPI") out of bankruptcy during 2005. During 2011, we acquired additional shares of WPI common stock and through a series of related transactions, became the sole owner of WPI. Effective as of March 1, 2012, pursuant to an internal reorganization, WestPoint Home, Inc. (a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of WPI, which had previously comprised our Home Fashion business) merged into our newly created wholly owned indirect subsidiary (which was formed as a Delaware limited liability company solely for the purposes of such merger) and continued its business as a limited liability company under the name WestPoint Home LLC. In referencing WPH, we refer to WestPoint Home Inc. and WestPoint Home LLC interchangeably because the business profile of our Home Fashion segment's business did not change as a result of this reorganization.
Business
WPH's business consists of manufacturing, sourcing, marketing, distributing and selling home fashion consumer products. WPH differentiates itself in the home fashion textile industry based on its 200 plus-year heritage of providing its customers with: (1) a full assortment of home fashion products; (2) good customer service; (3) a superior value proposition; and (4) branded and private label products with strong consumer recognition. WPH markets a broad range of manufactured and sourced bed, bath, basic bedding and other textile products, including sheets, pillowcases, bedspreads, quilts, comforters and duvet covers, bath and beach towels, bath accessories, bed skirts, bed pillows, flocked blankets, woven blankets and throws and mattress pads. 
WPH manufactures and sources its products in a wide assortment of colors and patterns from a variety of fabrics, including chambray, twill, sateen, and from a variety of fibers, including cotton, synthetics and cotton blends. WPH seeks to position its business as a single-source supplier to retailers of home fashion products, offering a broad assortment of products across multiple price points. WPH believes that product and price point breadth allows it to provide a comprehensive product offering for each major distribution channel.
WPH transitioned the majority of its manufacturing to Bahrain, a low-cost country, and continues to maintain its corporate offices and certain distribution operations in the United States.
Strategy
Beginning with its purchase of the assets of WestPoint Stevens in 2005, WPH has been focused on restructuring its business by reducing costs and improving profitability.  WPH's restructuring process has taken several years and remains on-going.  These actions have included moving manufacturing operations overseas, reducing labor costs, attempting to source goods at lower prices and addressing unfavorable licensing arrangements. WPH has also been focused on significant restructuring in the United States, which has included streamlining its merchandising, sales, customer service, finance divisions and its distribution process. 
WPH believes its principal manufacturing facility in Bahrain allows it to benefit from competitive labor rates, attractive incentives, low energy costs and a favorable tax treaty.  WPH currently has one non-U.S. manufacturing plant and one manufacturing plant and one distribution center in the United States. WPH regularly reviews the possibility of implementing additional cost-saving measures.  
Brands, Trademarks and Licenses
WPH markets its products under trademarks, brand names and private labels, which it uses as merchandising tools to assist its customers in coordinating their product offerings and differentiating their products from those of their competitors. 
WPH manufactures and sells its own branded line of home fashion products consisting of merchandise bearing registered trademarks that include WestPoint Home, Grand Patrician, Martex, Luxor, Modern Living and Vellux.
21

In addition, some of WPH's home fashion products are manufactured and sold pursuant to licensing agreements under designer and brand names that include, among others, IZOD, Southern Tide, Under the Canopy and Portico.
Private label brands, also known as “store brands,” are controlled by individual retail customers through use of their own brands or through an exclusive license or other arrangement with brand owners. Private label brands provide retail customers with a way to promote consumer loyalty, as the brand is owned and controlled by WPH's retail customers and not by WPH. As WPH's customer base has experienced consolidation, there has been an increasing focus on proprietary branding strategies.
The percentage of WPH's net sales derived from the sale of private label branded and unbranded products for 2016 was approximately 40%. For 2016, the percentage of WPH net sales derived from sales under brands it owns and controls was approximately 38%, and the percentage of WPH net sales derived from sales under brands owned by third parties pursuant to licensing arrangements with WPH was approximately 22%.
Customers
WPH sells its home fashion products to, chain stores, mass merchants, department stores, specialty stores and warehouse clubs, both domestically and internationally. During 2016, WPH's top five customers accounted for approximately 66% of its net sales, one of which individually accounted for approximately 26% of its net sales. 
Competition
The home fashion industry is fragmented and highly competitive. Future success will, to a large extent, depend on WPH's ability to be a competitive low-cost producer. WPH competes with both foreign and domestic companies on, among other factors, the basis of price, quality, design and customer service. WPH may also face competition in the future from companies that are currently third-party suppliers to WPH. Future success depends on the ability to remain competitive in the areas of marketing, product development, price, quality, brand names, manufacturing capabilities, distribution and order processing. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, WPH had 2,244 employees worldwide.
Holding Company
We seek to invest our available cash and cash equivalents in liquid investments with a view to enhancing returns as we continue to assess further acquisitions of, or investments in, operating businesses.
As of December 31, 2016, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately $1.7 billion in the Investment Funds. We may redeem our direct investment in the Investment Funds upon notice.
We conduct our activities in a manner so as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Generally, this means that we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business and that no more than 40% of our total assets will be invested in investment securities as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we intend to structure our investments so as to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than as a corporation under the applicable publicly traded partnership rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
