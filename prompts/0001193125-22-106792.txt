Overview
--------


We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination or our business combination. We have not selected any potential business combination targets and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination targets. 
 We intend to leverage our deep financial and investing experience, extensive deal flow and large contact networks in order to pursue exceptional opportunities with high-quality growth companies in our focus sectors of financial technology (“FinTech”), software and tech-enabled services. We will use our expertise in fundamental business analysis and company and industry due diligence to identify and confirm the strength of any business we evaluate. We will then leverage our extensive transactional and capital markets experience to negotiate and close the business combination. Post-business combination, we plan to utilize our growth acceleration capabilities to drive shareholder value. Although our team will focus on a business combination within the FinTech, software and tech-enabled services sectors, we may consummate a transaction with a business in any industry. 
 Our Company 
 Steve McLaughlin and Gene Yoon are our senior sponsors and serve as our Co-Chairmen and as directors. Through them, we are affiliated with FT Partners and Sagemount (each an “Affiliated Organization”). FT Partners is 100% beneficially owned by Mr. McLaughlin, its founder and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). FT Partners is a leading FinTech-focused investment banking firm with a 20-year history of providing merger and acquisition (“M&A”), financing and other financial advisory services to FinTech businesses globally. Sagemount was founded by Mr. Yoon in 2012, and is a growth-focused technology private investment firm with 21 investment professionals, a team of operating professionals dedicated to accelerating portfolio company growth, and $3.5 billion in cumulative capital raised. Larry Furlong, a Managing Director at FT Partners, serves as our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Jaskaran Heir, a Vice President at Sagemount, serves as our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). Mr. McLaughlin, Mr. Yoon, Mr. Furlong and Mr. Heir serve together as our executive leadership group (collectively, our “Executive Management”). 
 We believe we possess three core competitive strengths that differentiate us as we seek to complete a business combination: 
 i) Experienced and entrepreneurial executives with histories of helping companies create value, including via numerous successful special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) business combinations; 
 ii) A valuable and complementary mix of skills and capabilities ideal for due diligence and transaction execution success, and an ability to drive growth and value post-business combination; and 
 iii) A focus on transaction opportunities within the compelling and large sectors of FinTech, software and tech-enabled services. 
 Our Executive Management (supported by a much broader team made up of professionals from our Affiliated Organizations) are investment banking and private investment professionals with significant transaction and investing knowledge and experience. Our Co-Chairmen, Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Yoon, are each successful entrepreneurs and executives and have, individually and through their firms, helped a large number of companies create value for their shareholders and owners. In addition, Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Yoon have collaborated on several transactions, including the SPAC business combination of Open Lending, LLC (“Open Lending”) and Nebula Acquisition Corporation in June 2020, among others. See the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Executive Management” for a more complete description of our Executive Management members’ backgrounds and experience. 
 We believe our team’s valuable and complementary skills and capabilities (including the skills and capabilities of the members of our Affiliated Organizations) represent a unique set of qualifications that position us well for transaction execution success and post-business combination value creation. Our collective sell-side (investment banking advisory) expertise and buy-side (investing) experience, coupled with our entrepreneurial and business-building capabilities, make us an attractive team for public market investors and target companies alike. See the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Business Strategy” for a more complete description of how we intend to utilize our combined skills and capabilities, and those of our Affiliated Organizations, to effect a successful transaction. While we believe our Affiliated Organizations possess skills and capabilities helpful for sourcing and completing a business combination and driving post-business combination growth, we may not utilize any or all of those skills and capabilities. 
 We focus on compelling and large target sectors in which we have domain experience and the ability to source attractive business combination opportunities. Our selected sectors, FinTech, software and tech-enabled services, exhibit key characteristics including positive secular trends, attractive markets, strong growth, visible revenue streams and opportunities for compelling long-term risk-adjusted returns. According to UBS, the global FinTech industry is expected to reach $500 billion of revenue by 2030, an increase of more than three times the $150 billion of revenue generated in 2018. According to KPMG, global FinTech investment grew to $210 billion across 5,684 deals in 2021, up from $125 billion across 3,674 deals in 2020. Gartner forecasted that worldwide enterprise software spending would grow 7% in 2021 to $492 billion, and that overall worldwide information technology spending (including both software and IT/communications services) would grow 4% in 2021 to over $3.8 trillion. Within the growth-oriented sectors we have chosen, we believe the universe of businesses of appropriate investment size for our business combination is continuously expanding as early-stage private companies develop and grow. We also believe that there are a large number of private companies in our focus sectors that would like to have publicly-traded 
 
4 

  shares in order to provide liquidity to investors and employees, to create a currency for mergers and acquisitions, to secure capital permanence and to provide additional secondary benefits to their businesses. See the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Market Opportunity” for a more complete description of our target sectors and the related opportunity. 
 Executive Management 
 Our team is led by experienced and entrepreneurial executives with histories of helping companies create value for their shareholders and owners. Our Executive Management consists of Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Yoon as Co-Chairmen and directors, Mr. Furlong as CEO and Mr. Heir as CFO. 
 Mr. McLaughlin is the founder, Chief Executive Officer and 100% beneficial owner of FT Partners. He has over 25 years of leadership and experience in FinTech and financial services and is regarded as an important thought-leader and pioneer in the global emergence of FinTech. Since founding FT Partners in 2001, Mr. McLaughlin has grown the firm to more than 200 employees, expanded its office presence from its headquarters in San Francisco to New York City and London, and solidified its position as a leading global investment bank exclusively focused on FinTech. FT Partners has advised on more than 300 M&A, financing and advisory transactions over its history, and Mr. McLaughlin was ranked #1 on the list of “Most Influential Dealmakers in FinTech” in the FinTech Finance 40 by Institutional Investor in November 2018. 
 Mr. McLaughlin and FT Partners have advised on several high-profile M&A transactions considered landmark deals in the FinTech sector, including Heartland Payment Systems, Inc.’s sale to Global Payments Inc. for $4.3 billion, SquareTrade Holding Company, Inc.’s sale to The Allstate Corporation for $1.4 billion, Cayan LLC’s sale to Total System Services, Inc. for $1.05 billion, Assurance IQ, Inc.’s sale to Prudential Financial, Inc. for up to $3.5 billion, and Finicity Corporation’s sale to Mastercard Incorporated for up to $985 million. Mr. McLaughlin and FT Partners have also advised on numerous important FinTech financing and/or recapitalization transactions, including five financings totaling approximately $930 million for AvidXchange, Inc., six financings totaling over $500 million for Marqeta, Inc., and the recapitalization of Mercury Payments Systems, Inc. by Silver Lake Partners in 2010 (as well as advising on the subsequent sale of Mercury Payments Systems, LLC to Vantiv, Inc. for $1.65 billion). 
 Notably, Mr. McLaughlin and FT Partners have also advised eight private FinTech companies in their closed SPAC business combinations during the last few years. These transactions include Open Lending’s business combination with Nebula Acquisition Corporation, which closed on June 10, 2020 (NASDAQ: LPRO); CardConnect LLC’s (“CardConnect”) business combination with FinTech Acquisition Corp., which closed on July 6, 2017, as well as CardConnect’s subsequent sale to First Data Corporation on July 5, 2017 for $15.00 per share (NASDAQ: CCN); the business combination of Repay Holdings, LLC and its parent Hawk Parent Holdings, LLC (together “Repay”) with Thunder Bridge Acquisition, Ltd., which closed on July 11, 2019 (NASDAQ: RPAY); Porch.com, Inc.’s (“Porch”) business combination with PropTech Acquisition Corporation, which closed on December 23, 2020 (NASDAQ: PRCH); Payoneer Inc.’s business combination with FTAC Olympus Acquisition Corp., which closed on June 25, 2021 (NASDAQ: PAYO); MoneyLion Inc.’s business combination with Fusion Acquisition Corp., which closed on September 22, 2021 (NYSE: ML); CompoSecure Holdings, Inc.’s business combination with Roman DBDR Tech Acquisition Corp., which closed on December 27, 2021 (NASDAQ: COMPO); and Forge Global Holdings, Inc.’s business combination with Motive Capital Corp (NYSE: FRGE), which closed on March 21, 2022. 
 Prior to founding FT Partners, Mr. McLaughlin worked for Goldman, Sachs & Co. (“Goldman Sachs”), where he was a member of the Financial Institutions Group and became one of the earliest and most senior investment bankers in the firm’s Financial Technology Group. He began his career in the Financial Management Program and Corporate Audit Staff at General Electric Corp. 
 Mr. Yoon is the founder and Managing Partner of Sagemount, a growth-focused technology private investment firm. Mr. Yoon has over 20 years of investing and advisory experience, has evaluated thousands of investment opportunities, and has personally led dozens of investments for some of the most respected private investment firms in the industry. Since founding Sagemount with the raising of $500 million in committed capital in 2012, Mr. Yoon has led fundraises for two additional equity funds and two credit funds, bringing the firm’s cumulative committed capital to $3.5 billion. Mr. Yoon and Sagemount have made investments in over 50 FinTech, software and tech-enabled services companies and Sagemount has expanded from a founding team of five investment professionals to 21. During this time, Sagemount has completed a number of notable transactions with portfolio companies, including Internet Truckstop Group, LLC’s sale to ICONIQ Capital, LLC in April 2019, and Sagemount’s investment to fund DiscoverOrg, LLC’s acquisition of Zoom Information, Inc. in February 2019 (prior to the combined company’s IPO as ZoomInfo Technologies, Inc. in June 2020). Mr. Yoon and Sagemount also were the lead investors in Open Lending, which recently completed a SPAC business combination with Nebula Acquisition Corporation. After leading Sagemount’s investment in Open Lending in 2016, Mr. Yoon was actively involved in its growth as a board member and helped lead its SPAC business combination (in collaboration with Mr. McLaughlin and their respective firms) in June 2020. Mr. Yoon continues to serve as a board member of the surviving entity, Open Lending Corporation. Mr. Yoon was ranked #1 on the list of “Top 40 Under 40 Growth Investors” by GrowthCap in July 2014. 
 Prior to founding Sagemount, Mr. Yoon served as the Head of Private Equity for Goldman Sachs’ Americas Special Situations Group, where he led and managed numerous investments in private companies, including Vivint, Inc. (“Vivint”), LifeLock, Inc. (“LifeLock”) and Amber Road, Inc. (“Amber Road”). Mr. Yoon served in a board capacity for each of Vivint, LifeLock and Amber Road until founding Sagemount in 2012. The Blackstone Group acquired Vivint in 2012 and it became a publicly traded company via a SPAC business combination in 2020. LifeLock became a publicly traded company in 2012 and was acquired by Symantec Corporation in 2017 for $2.3 billion. Amber Road became a publicly traded company in 2014 and was acquired by e2Open, LLC for approximately $425 million in 2019. Before joining Goldman Sachs, Mr. Yoon served as a Partner at Great Hill Partners, a growth-focused private equity firm. Prior to that, Mr. Yoon was Director of Corporate Development at Geocast Network Systems and an investment banker at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. 
 Mr. Furlong, our CEO, has approximately 25 years of banking and finance experience and has been a Managing Director at FT Partners for 12 years. During his career as an investment banker at both Goldman Sachs and FT Partners, Mr. Furlong has worked with large numbers of businesses across several sectors, with a particular emphasis on financial services and FinTech. He has advised clients on a myriad of transaction types, including significant numbers of private and public company equity financings (including numerous IPO transactions), private and public debt and bank financings, and many M&A transactions (including the above-referenced SPAC business combination of CardConnect and FinTech Acquisition Corp. in 2016). During his tenure at FT

  Partners, Mr. Furlong advised on, and worked closely with, Mr. McLaughlin on many of the high-profile, complex and successful transactions executed by the firm. Just prior to joining FT Partners in 2010, Mr. Furlong was a partner in a start-up media business in Los Angeles. Before that, he was a senior investment banker at Goldman Sachs and a member of that firm’s Financial Institutions Group in New York, London and Los Angeles. He began his career as a commercial banker at BB&T Corp. 
 Mr. Heir, our CFO, has 11 years of private equity and investment banking experience. Mr. Heir is currently a Vice President at Sagemount, and has been with the firm since 2014. At Sagemount, Mr. Heir has worked on numerous investments, including the firm’s investment in Open Lending. Prior to joining Sagemount, Mr. Heir was an associate at CIVC Partners, LP and an analyst at Moelis & Company. 
 Success at the highest levels of investment banking and private investing requires the greatest degree of diligence, financial and market analysis capabilities, structuring creativity, operational knowledge, transaction execution expertise and investment acumen. Collectively, Mr. McLaughlin, Mr. Yoon, Mr. Furlong and Mr. Heir bring substantial investing and advisory experience, transaction execution capabilities and contact networks within our target sectors. We believe this combination of qualifications will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek a business combination in a competitive market. 
 We also believe that our Executive Management’s access to the institutionalized processes and members of our Affiliated Organizations, who bring their own sets of skills, capabilities and contact networks to our team, represents a significant advantage as we seek to effect our business combination. Specifically, our Executive Management may be supported by more than 25 senior investment bankers (Managing Directors and Directors) and more than 200 total employees of FT Partners, and by the 21 investment professionals and team of operating professionals of Sagemount. Our Affiliated Organizations are described in further detail below. 
 Affiliated Organizations 
 FT Partners. Our Co-Chairman Mr. McLaughlin is the founder, CEO and 100% beneficial owner of FT Partners, an investment banking firm focused on FinTech. As a result, Mr. McLaughlin has the ability, but not the obligation, to deploy the capabilities of FT Partners in our efforts to complete a business combination. Mr. Furlong, our CEO, is also a Managing Director at FT Partners. 
 FT Partners’ investment banking professionals are supported by proprietary resources and capabilities which may be utilized by us, including:

Our Co-Chairman Mr. Yoon is the founder and Managing Partner of Sagemount, a growth-focused technology private investment firm that provides flexible capital and strategic assistance to companies across a wide variety of transaction situations. As a result, Mr. Yoon and Sagemount have the ability, but not the obligation, to deploy the capabilities of Sagemount in our efforts to complete a business combination. Mr. Heir, our CFO, is also a Vice President at Sagemount. 
 Sagemount has several core resources and capabilities we may leverage, including:

We believe that Sagemount’s sourcing capabilities can be leveraged to generate business combination opportunities for us.

Our Independent Directors 
 Our efforts to seek a suitable business combination target will be complemented and augmented by the expertise and network of relationships of our independent directors, who have experience in technological, operational and financial matters. See Item 10 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for more information on our independent directors. 
 Notwithstanding our Executive Management’s, our Affiliated Organizations’ and our independent directors’ experience, there is no guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate, or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our business combination. You should not rely on the historical records of our team’s performance as indicative of our future performance. 
 Business Strategy 
 We seek to identify and combine with a strong company that will create long-term value for shareholders. In order accomplish this goal, our strategy is to utilize our team’s specific mix of valuable and complementary skills and capabilities (including the skills and capabilities of members of our Affiliated Organizations) to execute a successful transaction and drive post-business combination growth and value creation. We believe our collective sell-side (investment banking advisory) expertise and buy-side (investing) experience, coupled with our entrepreneurial and business-building capabilities, make us a unique and attractive team for public market investors and target companies alike. 
 The specific execution skills and capabilities which we will utilize to execute our strategy are outlined in some detail below. 
 

• | Identifying an Acquisition. Our team intends to leverage their backgrounds, experience and proprietary sourcing capabilities to identify strong business combination targets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sector Experience and Knowledge. Our Executive Management has significant FinTech, software and tech-enabled services sector experience gained from years spent advising hundreds of companies and executing dozens of investments. These executives may be further supported by the investment bankers, investment professionals and other members of our Affiliated Organizations, each of whom provide significant additional experience and sector expertise. We believe that this collective experience and knowledge will help us to identify sector trends and to target the emerging companies within our focus sectors that represent attractive business combination opportunities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sourcing Capabilities. We believe that our ability to source an attractive business combination within our focus sectors is a key competitive strength. Our relationships and professional contact networks include, among others, private equity and venture capital investors, entrepreneurs and business founders, investment bankers, large institutional and high-net worth capital sources, advisors and professional services firms, and industry executives and senior managers. These relationships and networks put us at the epicenter of information and deal flow in our focus sectors and give us a unique targeting and sourcing advantage in the market. In addition, our Affiliated Organizations each have an existing strategy to build relationships with attractive companies early and to monitor them throughout their life-cycles, which we may leverage as we target an attractive business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disciplined Investment Process. We intend to utilize Mr. Yoon’s and Sagemount’s investing experience and capabilities, and couple it with the analytical rigor that Mr. McLaughlin and FT Partners bring to their assessment of companies and markets. Our investment process will focus on four key areas:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fundamental Business Analysis. We believe our ability to conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis is particularly strong given our collective investing and advisory experience. Key qualitative analysis areas include market opportunity, competitive environment, growth potential, risk assessment (including industry, political and regulatory risks), value chain relationships, drivers of strategic value, revenue model strength and management team quality, among other items. Key quantitative analysis areas include revenue growth and profitability drivers, revenue visibility and resiliency, customer growth and retention rates, unit economics, cost structure and financial position, among others.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Differentiated Due Diligence. We believe that due diligence is a critical and, for our team, differentiating factor in the evaluation of a potential business combination. For any prospective target business, in order to support the fundamental analyses described above, we expect to conduct due diligence which could, but may not encompass, as applicable and among other activities, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, competitor analysis and reviews of financial and other information. In addition to our team of executives and members of our Affiliated Organizations, we may engage a variety of third parties to perform due diligence functions where their expertise will be additive to our analyses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Valuation. Our experience as growth investors, augmented by our sell-side investment banking advisory backgrounds and experience, allows us to draw upon a valuation framework honed over many years across different transaction types and market environments within our focus sectors. Our valuation analysis will consider all identified potential risks and levels of uncertainty.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Structuring and Negotiation. We believe our collective experience from years of investing and transaction advisory services generally, as well as prior experience with SPAC business combinations specifically, provide us with a differentiated deal structuring and negotiation skillset. We believe our experience provides us with the ability to develop an understanding of competing priorities among stakeholders and creatively structure transaction terms to reach a business combination agreement beneficial for all parties. Our deal team will be able to distill negotiations to meaningful points and to respond to investment situations quickly and effectively, while remaining appropriately focused on long-term shareholder value creation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Post-Business Combination Value-Creation. Following our business combination, we expect to assist the target in its growth and value-creation for shareholders. We may collaborate with the acquired company’s management on any number of initiatives, including navigating the public markets, analyzing capital allocation, acquiring talent and broadening the network of potential partners and customers, among many others. In particular, however, we believe our combined team has two very distinct capabilities that will prove attractive to potential businesses looking to maximize value:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



7 

  
• | Facilitating Organic Growth. Post-business combination, we may utilize Sagemount’s Growth Factors team to help drive organic growth. Key organic growth pillars that Growth Factors has meaningful experience with and may leverage include sales acceleration, technology and innovation, and pricing optimization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Executing on Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships. In addition to organic growth, we will leverage our team’s knowledge and experience in our focus sectors to potentially source and integrate value-additive strategic acquisitions for the business we acquire. We believe that this is a differentiating factor for our team, and will prove very attractive to management teams looking to grow and expand their companies. Due to our market presence and network, we can also help the acquired company access senior executives across our focus sectors and help to foster partnerships with value chain participants.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overall, we believe that our ability to identify business combination targets, to implement our disciplined due diligence and investment processes, and our potential to help drive post-combination value creation provide us with a considerable advantage in executing our business strategy. 
 Market Opportunity 
 We are focused on compelling and large target sectors. Our focus sectors, FinTech, software and tech-enabled services, each generally exhibit a set of characteristics that are key for investment success, including positive secular trends, attractive markets, strong growth, visible revenue streams and opportunities for compelling long-term risk-adjusted returns. We believe that the clear dynamics and attractive investment fundamentals existing in our focus sectors will continue to drive strong business performance for companies in our sectors and that our team is particularly well-suited to identify a strong business combination within these sectors. 
 Additional specific detail for our focus sectors is found below. 
 FinTech. We define FinTech as the dynamic intersection of financial services and technology. Companies in this sector provide technology solutions that enable and improve the creation, distribution and management of financial products and services (including those innovative and disruptive companies that provide for financial services distribution and management online, via mobile applications and, increasingly, through non-financial services businesses). The sector also includes companies with technology solutions that enhance the internal financial-related processes for all types of organizations, not just financial services companies. Generally, targets within the FinTech sector rely heavily on platforms and technology to scale their businesses and generate compelling unit economics. The capital-light nature of many FinTech business models and the potential to scale globally provide FinTech companies with exceptional opportunities to generate high revenue growth, attractive margins and strong free cash flow. 
 Multiple factors are driving a sustained wave of demand for FinTech solutions. Within nearly all organizations, there is an increasingly critical need to modernize cumbersome and often paper-based, legacy financial processes via digitization and software solutions. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 have accelerated the already acute need to adapt financial solutions to changing end-user preferences for online and mobile applications. Furthermore, heightened compliance and regulatory pressures are pushing organizations to seek out technology solutions to solve data gathering, security, monitoring and analytical challenges. Finally, new technologies (including cloud-based software, artificial intelligence, blockchain, machine learning and robotic process automation) are enabling substantial improvements in the distribution and management of financial solutions and the creation of entirely new financial products and FinTech businesses. 
 FinTech is a growth sector. According to UBS, the global FinTech industry is expected to reach $500 billion of revenue by 2030, an increase of more than three times the $150 billion of revenue generated in 2018. Additionally, KPMG reports that global FinTech investments grew to $210 billion across 5,684 deals in 2021, up from $125 billion across 3,674 deals in 2020. 
 We believe that most businesses within the FinTech sector can be broadly categorized into one of the vertical groupings outlined below. Within these verticals, companies may operate under a variety of business models including, but not limited to i) monetization of the marketing, sale and distribution of financial products, ii) transaction processing, and/or iii) provision of technology solutions, including software, online services and mobile apps, hardware, and data and analytics. Our key FinTech verticals include: 
 

• | Payments: Includes electronic payment processing solution providers; merchant acquirers and payment gateways serving merchants, enterprises, governments and educational institutions; debit and credit payment networks and other electronic bank-to-bank payment solutions; virtual card solution providers; consumer payment solutions including digital wallets, person-to-person (P2P) payments, and other mobile payment solutions; consumer money transfer solutions; cross-border and foreign currency solutions for businesses; payment fraud prevention and transaction security solutions; payment specific hardware including automated teller machines (ATMs) and point-of-sale software platforms and terminals; crypto currency-related payment solutions; e-commerce platforms and checkout solutions; and loyalty and rewards solutions;

Each of these verticals within the FinTech sector has its own competitive landscape, set of market dynamics and growth characteristics. We believe that our Executive Management and the members of our Affiliated Organizations have strong experience and unique knowledge in each of these verticals, allowing us to effectively analyze a wide range of potential FinTech business combination opportunities. 
 Software and Tech-Enabled Services. The software and tech-enabled services sectors encompass a broad range of vertical market, horizontal market, and digital infrastructure tools and solutions utilized by businesses and consumers. Businesses within the two sectors generally focus on enhancing, streamlining and, in many cases, digitizing traditional processes in order to lower costs, improve speed and efficiency, provide greater accessibility and increase accuracy, among other benefits. More specifically, software companies develop and deliver proprietary products, systems and applications, whereas tech-enabled services companies offer service solutions to businesses and consumers that are integrated with, or leverage, software and/or other technology tools. 
 We believe the software and tech-enabled services sectors share many drivers that support continued topline revenue growth. These factors include the digital transformation of workflows across functional areas of nearly all industries and in all aspects of consumer life, the migration to cloud computing and the movement towards ubiquitous bandwidth and mobility. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 have further accelerated the digital transformation for consumers and organizations and increased the need to upgrade legacy processes, products and solutions. Gartner forecasted that worldwide enterprise software spending would grow 7% in 2021 to $492 billion, and that overall worldwide information technology spending (including both software and IT/communications services) would grow 4% in 2021 to over $3.8 trillion. 
 In addition to compelling topline growth, we believe software and tech-enabled services share characteristics that lead to attractive overall financial profiles including, but not limited to i) profitable and sustainable unit economics driven by the proprietary nature of products and solutions, ii) strong revenue visibility due to contractually-recurring or reoccurring customer usage, iii) high gross margins and free cash flow conversion at scale, and iv) the ability to further enhance margins by upselling existing products or solutions and/or by cross-selling other products or solutions with minimal additional cost. 
 We believe most businesses within the software and tech-enabled services sectors can be broadly categorized into one of the following vertical groupings: 
 

• | Vertical Market Software: Includes mission-critical software applications that enable companies to interact digitally with customers, suppliers and other key constituents in their respective vertical industries;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



9 

  
• | Horizontal Market Software: Includes enterprise software applications that focus on one or more functional areas regardless of industry, such as sales and marketing automation, manufacturing and product development, human resources and workforce management, and finance and accounting, among others;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data Analytics: Includes software and/or data that enable customers to gather and process information that can be used to inform key business insights and decisions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developer Tools: Includes software and tools that enable software engineers to write, develop, test, package and deliver applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Infrastructure and Security Software: Includes software that monitors, manages and protects key technology delivery infrastructure, such as network connectivity, bandwidth, storage, database, computing resource (cloud, on-premise or hybrid), device management and the cybersecurity of all of those infrastructure elements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tech-Enabled Services: Includes data, information services, process automation, and other solutions that utilize technology to deliver better, faster and cheaper services than status quo. Services can be vertical market specific or applicable to many industries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As a result of all the above sector-specific dynamics, we believe that the market opportunity is strong and that companies within the FinTech, software and tech-enabled services sectors present particularly attractive business combination opportunities for us. Additionally, we believe that now is an opportune time to pursue a business combination. Given the operational complexity and extraordinary market uncertainty related to COVID-19, we believe that many attractive private businesses have an increased desire to become public companies. We believe there are a large number of private companies that would benefit from having publicly-traded shares to provide liquidity to investors and employees, to create a currency for mergers and acquisitions, to secure capital permanence and to provide secondary benefits to their businesses, yet are wary of the potential time required for, and risks associated with, a traditional initial public offering process. Furthermore, we believe the universe of companies of appropriate business combination size for us within our focus sectors is continuously expanding, as early-stage private companies develop and grow. In our focus sectors, the number of companies that have achieved “unicorn” status (suggesting an estimated enterprise valuation for each company of $1 billion or more) over the last few years has continued to increase, with more than 400 new “unicorn” companies emerging between 2015 and 2020 (based on data from Pitchbook). Moreover, according to Pitchbook, the number of investments of $50 million or greater into businesses within our combined sectors has risen from 246 transactions in 2015 to over 480 transactions in 2020. Finally, we are open to combining with businesses owned by founders, families, minority and venture investors, businesses controlled by private equity firms and businesses that are candidates for corporate divestiture, which increases the number of potential combination opportunities available to us. 
 Competitive Advantage 
 The relationship network, sourcing, valuation, diligence and execution capabilities of our team should provide us what we believe to be a significant and attractive pipeline of opportunities. Our competitive strengths include: 

• | Significant National Security and Technology Sector Expertise. Our management team, board of directors and advisors have spent the majority of their careers working with emerging national security and technology companies. Collectively, our team has more than 100 years of operational and investment experience in these industries. Due to the team’s prolific investment experience in these areas, we have developed a deep understanding of these sectors and an ability to identify technologies that are on the forefront of strengthening national security capabilities. This extensive market knowledge has a meaningful impact on our team’s investment decisions and how we identify attractive opportunities with visionary businesses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extensive Investment and Operational Experience. We meticulously built our executive management team, board of directors and advisory board with personnel in the national security, technology and telecommunications industries with notable experience across various government, operational, financial, private investment, c-suite and board-level roles.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage Our Network to Identify Investment Opportunities. We intend to capitalize on our management team’s domain expertise acquired through decades of strategic deal-making in the national security, technology and telecommunications sectors and related industries. We believe our management’s deep network of CEO-level and other C-suite/board relationships in addition to pre-eminent private and public market investors will present us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify Opportunities Where We Can Accelerate Technological Advancement. We seek to identify and invest in visionary, commercially focused companies that we believe have real utility and potential to deliver enhanced national security capabilities. By utilizing our deep industry expertise and network, we are able to recognize and work with companies to enhance their ability to better anticipate and advance national security in the 21st century. We are committed to providing unique insights, nurturing creativity and accelerating the deployment and commercialization of innovative, disruptive technologies that offer compelling national security benefits.

Business Combination Criteria 
 We have developed the following high-level, non-exclusive investment criteria that we will use to guide us in screening for and evaluating target business combinations. We will seek to acquire a company that: 
 
10 

  
• | Is of the Appropriate Size: We intend to target entities with transaction enterprise values between approximately $1 billion and $5 billion, although we may target companies valued above or below that range. We believe the $1 to $5 billion valuation range contains a substantial number of available and potentially attractive targets which could benefit operationally, financially and/or strategically from a combination with us. To the extent the amount to be paid for any business combination exceeds the net proceeds available to us, we may issue debt or equity to consummate the acquisition. Such additional financing may come in the form of bank financings, preferred equity, common equity or debt offerings (or a combination of the foregoing).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Is a Leading Company in an Attractive Market: We are looking for a business that is currently, or is likely to become, a top performer in its industry. We will focus on identifying investment opportunities within industry segments that have large addressable end-user markets and that can generate strong organic growth. Those opportunities could be smaller businesses in developing and growing markets, or businesses rapidly taking market share in large but more stable markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Has a Strong Economic Model and Financial Profile, With Upside Opportunity: We intend to focus on companies that have the potential for high topline growth relative to their industry. We also will target businesses with diversified, visible, recurring (or re-occurring) revenue models, attractive unit economics and potential for high gross margins at scale, and the ability to generate significant free cash flows at maturity (even if they have chosen, or may choose, to reinvest that cash for future growth). Finally, we will seek targets where there is meaningful potential upside opportunity from pricing efficiencies, the introduction or expansion of new products and markets, operational improvements and M&A activity, among other factors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exhibits Technology and/or Data Differentiation: We will seek to identify companies that have built and can sustain meaningful long-term competitive advantages from superior technology and/or unique data assets. We believe that differentiated technology and data assets provide barriers-to-entry and competitive advantages which are difficult, costly and time-consuming to replicate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Boasts Exceptional, Committed and Public-Ready Leadership with Ambitious Goals: We will seek companies whose leaders have a track record of executing on long-term strategies and who have a bold vision for growing and creating significant additional value for their businesses. We also will seek a business combination with a company that has the immediate resources and personnel to meet the demands of being a public company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Can Be Acquired at an Appropriate Valuation: We are rigorous, disciplined and valuation-centric investors with a keen understanding of market value. We will only consummate a business combination if we believe that the valuation is appropriate for our shareholders on a risk-adjusted basis at the time of the transaction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The above investment criteria are not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination may be based on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our team may deem relevant. Any business combination we undertake may not exhibit each or all of these characteristics. 

11 

  Our Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to seek to determine a company’s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review may include, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, multiple meetings with management, consultations with, and analyses from, relevant industry experts, competitor analysis, customer and concentration reviews, and assessment of value chain relationships, among other items. 
 Members of our Executive Management, members of our Affiliated Organizations and our directors may or will directly or indirectly own our securities following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our business combination. Each of our Executive Management and directors, as well as members of our Affiliated Organizations, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing any business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Executive Management, our Affiliated Organizations or our directors. In the event we seek to complete our business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Executive Management, our Affiliated Organizations or our directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, if required by applicable law or based upon the decision of our board of directors or a committee thereof, may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions. 
 We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. Our Executive Management and Affiliated Organizations are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction with our company. We will not consider a business combination with any company that has already been identified to Sagemount at any time as a suitable acquisition candidate for Sagemount, unless Sagemount, in their sole discretion, declines such potential business combination or makes available to our company a co-investment opportunity, in each case, in accordance with any legal, contractual or other obligations of Sagemount and Sagemount’s applicable existing and future policies and procedures. Additionally, we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any substantive measure, directly or indirectly, to select or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for us, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to select or locate any such acquisition candidate. 
 Sagemount currently advises multiple investment vehicles and may raise additional funds, successor funds or other investment vehicles or accounts in the future, which may be during the period in which we are seeking our business combination. Such Sagemount investment entities may be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financing at any time. We may compete with any one or more of them on any given acquisition opportunity. 
 Each of our Executive Management, members of our Affiliated Organizations and our directors may presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such person is or will be required to present a business combination or investment opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our Executive Management, members of our Affiliated Organizations and our directors become aware of a business combination or investment opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then- current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity, in which case such opportunity may not be made available to us. Further, our Affiliated Organizations and each of our officers and directors have duties and obligations with respect to confidentiality to other entities and may in the future agree to additional such duties or obligations, which may prevent our Affiliated Organizations and such officers and directors from disclosing such information to us. Our Affiliated Organizations and our officers and directors will comply with such duties and obligations of confidentiality to such other entities, in which case, we may not have access to such information. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition (as defined in the “Initial Business Combination” section herein) opportunity with an entity to which Sagemount or an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the business combination by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. 
 In addition, our Executive Management, members of our Affiliated Organizations and our directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our business combination. As a result, our Executive Management, members of our Affiliated Organizations and our directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. 
 Our Executive Management, members of our Affiliated Organizations and our directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Moreover, our Executive Management, members of our Affiliated Organizations and our directors have, and will have in the future, time and attention requirements for current and future businesses, including clients, investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed or advised by our Affiliated Organizations. To the extent any conflict of interest arises between, on the one hand, us and, on the other hand, such businesses, clients, investments funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed or advised by our Affiliated Organizations (including, without limitation, arising as a result of certain of our Executive Management, members of our Affiliated Organizations and our directors being required to offer acquisition opportunities to such businesses, clients, investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities), our Executive Management, members of our Affiliated Organizations and our directors will resolve such conflicts of interest in their sole discretion in accordance with their then existing fiduciary, contractual, and other duties, and there can be no assurance that such conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor. In addition, while we believe our Affiliated Organizations possess skills and capabilities helpful for sourcing and completing a business combination and driving post-business combination growth, we may not utilize any or all of those skills and capabilities. 
 
12 

  Initial Business Combination 
 So long as our securities are then listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriters’ fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early-stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. 
 We may, at our option, pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with one or more entities affiliated with Sagemount and/or one or more investors in funds advised by Sagemount, Bregal, or affiliated with or advised by our officers or directors, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” Any such parties would co-invest only if (i) permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations; (ii) our officers and directors and Sagemount or Bregal considered a transaction to be mutually beneficial to us as well as the affiliated entity; and (iii) other business reasons exist to do so, such as the strategic merits of including such co-investors, the need for additional capital beyond the amount held in our trust account to fund the initial business combination and/or the desire to obtain committed capital for closing the initial business combination. Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. We refer to this potential future issuance, or a similar issuance to other specified purchasers, as a “specified future issuance” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. This is not an offer for any specified future issuance. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B ordinary shares, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of the Initial Public Offering plus all shares issued in the specified future issuance, unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agreed to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our Class B ordinary shares at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class B ordinary shares, but would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. They may waive such adjustment due to (but not limited to) the following: (i) closing conditions which are part of the agreement for our initial business combination; (ii) negotiation with Class A shareholders on structuring an initial business combination; (iii) negotiation with parties providing financing which would trigger the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B ordinary shares; or (iv) as part of the Affiliated Joint Acquisition. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our ordinary shares. 
 We anticipate structuring our business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding a business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test. 
 To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be impacted by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 
13 

  The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Corporate Information 
 Our executive offices are located at 277 Park Avenue, 29th Floor, Suite B, New York, New York 10172 and our telephone number is (212) 704-3000. Our website, the websites of our Affiliated Organizations, and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, those websites is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities. 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. 
 Financial Position 
 With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $475,852,262, after payment of the estimated out-of-pocket expenses of the Initial Public Offering and $17,356,817.80 for deferred underwriting fees and commissions, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the Initial Public Offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 
14 

  If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions with any business combination target. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business, other than our officers and directors. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in the Initial Public Offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business. 
 We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. Other than the potential availability of forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements with our sponsor, we are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, including FT Partners, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a business combination, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. We have agreed to pay affiliates of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month, in the aggregate, for office space, secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. See Item 10 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 Nasdaq rules require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account). The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. 
 In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors in the Initial Public Offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may complete our initial business combination. 
 
15 

  To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, competitor analysis, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons. 
 Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 

• | we issue Class A ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our Class A ordinary shares then outstanding;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 

• | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. 
 None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our initial shareholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 
Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). 
 However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of the Initial Public Offering, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements. 
 
17 

  Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq rules. 
 If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------


In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 18,596,591, or 37.5% (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), or 3,099,432, or 6.25% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), of the 49,590,908 public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our initial shareholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination. 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 
18 

  However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
 Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. 
 Our initial shareholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). 
 Our initial shareholders, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we do not then become subject to the 
 
19 

  SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our initial shareholders, any executive officer or director, or any other person. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $1,000,000 held outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. 
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $1,000,000 following the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $2,700,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $2,700,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. 
 If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy or insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy or insolvency claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of 
 
20 

  holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Facilities 
 We currently maintain our executive offices at 277 Park Avenue, 29th Floor, Suite B, New York, New York 10172. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee, in the aggregate, we pay to affiliates of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
 We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not currently intend to have any fulltime employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 
21 

  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
