ITEM 1. Business
 
Mirage Energy Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 6, 2014 as Bridgewater Platforms, Inc. On November 7, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby it entered into a statutory merger with its wholly owned subsidiary, Mirage Energy Corporation, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes. The effect of the merger was that the Company is the surviving entity and changed its name to “Mirage Energy Corporation”.
 
On January 24, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Michael R. Ward, the sole director of the Company, whereby on the same date the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of 4Ward Resources Inc., a Texas corporation (“4Ward Resources”). The acquisition was completed on January 24, 2017.
 
The purpose of acquiring 4Ward Resources was for the Company to enter into the natural gas sale, pipeline, and storage business. The Company intends to develop an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States. 
 
The Company is in the process of preparing to obtain the necessary permits in Mexico and the United States. 
 
Mirage, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, intends to develop an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States. These pipelines will consist of the following components:
 
MEXICO PIPELINES:
 
PROGRESO PIPELINE: The planned pipeline will consist of 27 miles of 36” diameter pipe operated by WPF MEXICO PIPELINES, S. de R.L. de C.V. The pipeline will have a planned capacity to move 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to one or more compressor stations or to Mexican end-issuer markets.
 
ARGUELLES PIPELINE: The Arguelles Pipeline will consist of 84 miles of 36” diameter pipeline to be operated by WPF MEXICO PIPELINES, S. de R.L. de C.V. The pipeline will have the planned capacity to move 500 million cubic feet per of natural gas per day to one or more compressor stations or to Mexican end-user markets.
 
MEXICO UNDER GROUND NATURAL GAS STORAGE:
 
The proposed natural gas storage facility will be the first underground storage facility in the country of Mexico. Such a facility will give Mexico the ability to (1) balance peak loads by consumers, (2) implement price arbitrage on natural gas, (3) enable Mexico to create a Mexican natural gas hub for gas pricing thereby giving Mexico an alternative natural gas supply rather than limiting its choice to the natural gas spot market. The planned natural gas storage facility within their country will give Mexico a secure natural gas supply for approximately one year in the event all gas supplies were shut off from outside sources. This planned facility will be constructed in a depleted natural gas reservoir. We anticipate that the reservoir will have a capacity to store approximately 786 BCF (Billion Cubic Feet) of natural gas.
 
The planned storage facility will be designed with 70,000 BHP of compression utilizing 14 compressors for gas injection into the reservoir. Once constructed, we plan that our subsidiary, CENOTE ENERGY S. de R.L. de C.V., will operate the facility.

INTERNATIONAL PIPELINE CROSSING:
 
PROGRESO CROSSING: The planned Progresso crossing will be subject to a Presidential Permit for boring underneath the Rio Grande River. A 40” bore hole under the river will provide the channel through which the 36” pipe will be pulled. The proposed ownership on US side of river will be held by WPF TRANSMISSION, INC. and on the MEXICO side of the river will be held by WPF MEXICO PIPELINES S. de R.L. de C.V.
 
ARGUELLES CROSSING: The planned Argeuelles crossing will be subject to a Presidential Permit for boring underneath the Rio Grande River with another 40” boring with 36” pipe being pulled thru underneath the river through the bore hole. Ownership on US side of river will be held by WPF TRANSMISSION, INC. and on the MEXICO side of the river held by WPF MEXICO PIPELINES S. de R.L. de C.V.
 
UNITED STATES PIPELINES:
 
The planned CONCHO Pipeline will consist of 95 miles of 36” pipeline with the capacity to transport 500MMCFPD. WPF TRANSMISSION, INC. will own and operate this pipeline.
 
The COCHISE pipeline will consist of 68 miles of 36” pipeline with the capacity to transport 500MMCFPD. WPF TRANSMISSION, INC. will own and operate this pipeline.
 
On January 28, 2017, 4Ward Resources, Inc., Mirage Energy Corporation’s wholly owned subsidiary, acquired Michael Ward’s ninety (90%) percent interest in two Mexican companies. The remaining ten (10%) percent interest was acquired by Mirage Energy Corporation from Patrick Dosser. Patrick Dosser is Michael Ward’s son.
 
Together, Mirage Energy and 4Ward Resources own 100% of the two Mexican corporations. The two Mexican corporations are WPF MEXICO PIPELINES, S. de R.L. de C.V., and CENOTE ENERGY S. de R.L. de C.V. Additionally, 4Ward Resources acquired all of Michael Ward’s interest in WPF TRANSMISSION, INC., a Texas corporation.
 
During 2017, the Company decided to focus all of its efforts on its planned gas pipeline and storage enterprises and therefore sold its subsidiary, Bridgewater Construction, Ltd., to Emanuel Oliveira in exchange for the satisfaction of a debt obligation owed to Mr. Oliveira. The effective date of the transaction was February 1, 2017.
 
Competition
 
Proposed Pipeline Operations
 
Our proposed pipelines face competition from a number of sources, including major oil companies and other common carrier pipelines. Generally, pipelines are the lowest-cost method for long-haul commodity movements. Therefore, the most significant competitors for large volume shipments are other pipelines. 
 
Competition among pipelines is based primarily on access to commodity supply, market demand, and transportation charges offered for commodity movements. In addition, in areas where additional infrastructure is needed to accommodate production needs, we will compete with other pipeline providers to offer the necessary transportation services to meet market demand. 
 
In addition to competition from other pipelines, we face competition from trucks and rail that deliver products in a number of areas that we serve. While their costs may not be competitive for longer hauls or large volume shipments, these sources of transportation compete effectively for incremental and marginal volume in many areas where such means of transportation are prevalent.

U.S. GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Safety Regulation
 
Our planned U.S. pipelines will be subject to United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulations and to regulations under comparable state statutes relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities.
 
DOT regulations require operators of hazardous liquid interstate pipelines to develop and follow a program to assess the integrity of all pipeline segments that could affect designated “high consequence areas,” including: high population areas, drinking water and ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release, and commercially navigable waterways. We will prepare our own written Integrity Management Program, identified the line segments that could impact high consequence areas, and completed a full assessment of these segments as prescribed by the regulations.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
General
 
Our planned operations will be subject to complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations which govern the handling and release of hydrocarbon materials, some of which are discussed below. Violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and, in some instances, injunctions banning or delaying certain activities. 
 
There are will also be risks of accidental hydrocarbon releases into the environment associated with our planned future operations, such as potential releases of hazardous substances from our planned pipelines or storage facility. To the extent an event were not covered by insurance policies, such accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from emergency response, environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations.
 
Rate Regulation
 
General Interstate Regulation
 
Interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and related rules and orders. The Interstate Commerce Act requires that tariff rates for petroleum pipelines be “just and reasonable” and not unduly discriminatory. 
Intrastate Regulation
 
Some of our planned pipeline operations will be subject to regulation by the Railroad Commission of Texas (“Texas RRC”). The applicable state statute will require that our planned pipeline rates be nondiscriminatory and provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services. State commissions generally have not initiated an investigation of rates or practices of petroleum pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints. Complaints to state agencies have been infrequent and are usually resolved informally. Although management cannot be certain that our intrastate rates ultimately would be upheld if challenged, we believe that, given this history, the tariffs now in effect are not likely to be challenged or, if challenged, are not likely to be ordered to be reduced.

MEXICO GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
In 2013 Mexico commenced its initiative on energy reform. A new legal regulatory framework was instituted by amending Mexico’s Federal Constitution. Mexico’s underlying regulatory laws and administrative regulations continue to be developed in regard to the oil and gas industry. The public policy behind this energy reform is to increase Mexico’s oil and gas production through exploration and extraction contracts, as well as by increasing midstream and downstream infrastructure.
 
Prior to this reform, all of Mexico’s hydrocarbon activities were reserved to the state-owned company PEMEX. This reform will now permit private companies to participate in the exploration and extraction of gas resources through bidding procedures. All underground hydrocarbons remain the property of Mexico. There is no private ownership of hydrocarbons in Mexico. 
 
Mexico’s domestic production of natural gas does not meet the national demand. Additional natural gas is imported. 
 
Mirage has proposed to focus its core business development of the midstream infrastructure with its proposed pipelines and storage facility.
 
Hydrocarbon Regulation
 
In Mexico, four regulatory bodies are responsible for regulation of hydrocarbon activities. These are (1) the Energy Ministry (SENER), (2) the National Hydrocarbon Commission (CNH), (3) the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), and (4) the National Agency of Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection of the Hydrocarbons Sector (ASEA).
Natural Gas Regulation
 
Natural gas activities are supervised and regulated by the CRE and the National Center for Natural Gas Control (CENAGAS). The CRE is the regulatory governmental body that issues permits related to gas activities. Additionally, the CRE supervises and oversees compliance with applicable laws, regulations and official Mexican standards, which includes, but is not limited to tariffs, pipelines and storage operations. CENAGAS was established to manage, administer and operate the National Natural Gas Transportation and Storage System with the view to ensure continuity and safety in natural gas activities throughout Mexico. ASEA supervises the health, safety and environmental protection of all natural gas activities throughout Mexico.
Lease, License, Concession Term
 
According to the hydrocarbon legal framework rights to oil and gas depend on the particular contractual plan applicable to the particular activities. We expect that our proposed natural gas storage field, if permitted, would be subject to a license contract. 
Taxes and Fees
 
Taxes and fees payable to Mexico will be governed by the license contract.
 


7

Liability
 
The license contract will provide for performing all environmental obligations, commitments and conditions as may be required by applicable law, best industry practices and environmental permits. The contractor will be responsible for all environmental damage.
Restrictions
 
License contracts may contain restrictions concerning the creation of liens or other ownership encumbrances arising from contracts or materials, the selling or assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any rights or participation interests or other contractual obligations. There may also be restrictions on changes in control of the contracting entity. In many cases, the prior written consent of the CNH may be required.
Title to Properties
 
None.
 
Employees
 
The Company has six employees comprised of its three named executive officers, one administrative and two accounting employees.
