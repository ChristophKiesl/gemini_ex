ITEM 1. Business
Corporate Overview
 
Nuo Therapeutics, Inc. is a Delaware corporation organized in 1998 under the name Informatix Holdings, Inc. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “Nuo Therapeutics,” “Nuo” and the “Company” refer to Nuo Therapeutics, Inc., and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates otherwise. In 1999, Autologous Wound Therapy, Inc., or AWT, an Arkansas Corporation, merged with and into Informatix Holdings, Inc. and the name of the surviving corporation was changed to Autologous Wound Therapy, Inc. In 2000, AWT changed its name to Cytomedix, Inc., or Cytomedix. In 2001, Cytomedix, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, after which Cytomedix was authorized to continue to conduct its business as a debtor and debtor-in-possession. Cytomedix emerged from bankruptcy in 2002 under a Plan of Reorganization. At that time, all of Cytomedix’s securities or other claims against or equity interest in Cytomedix, were canceled and of no further force or effect. Holders of certain securities, other claims or equity interests were entitled to receive new securities from Cytomedix in exchange for their securities, other claims or equity interests prior to the bankruptcy. In September 2007, Cytomedix received 510(k) clearance for the Aurix System, or Aurix (formerly known as the AutoloGelTM System), from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In April 2010, Cytomedix acquired the Angel® Whole Blood Separation System, referred to as Angel or the Angel® Business, from Sorin Group USA, Inc., or Sorin. In February 2012, Cytomedix, acquired Aldagen, Inc., or Aldagen, a privately held developmental cell-therapy company located in Durham, NC. In 2014, Cytomedix changed its name to Nuo Therapeutics, Inc. In 2016, Nuo Therapeutics filed for and emerged from bankruptcy under Chapter 11 as described below under “- Bankruptcy and Emergence from Bankruptcy.” Aldagen is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nuo Therapeutics. Our principal offices are located at 207A Perry Parkway, Suite 1, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20877; and our telephone number is (240) 499-2680.

Bankruptcy and Emergence from Bankruptcy
 
Filing of Petition
 
On January 26, 2016, the Company filed a voluntary petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the Bankruptcy Court, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, which is administered under the caption “In re: Nuo Therapeutics, Inc.”, Case No. 16-10192 (MFW). We refer to this petition and the related case as the Chapter 11 Case. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Case, the Company continued to operate its business as a “debtor-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.

In conjunction with the Company’s filing of the Chapter 11 Case, on January 29, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Company's motion and entered an interim order which required certain notices and restricted proposed transfers of the Company's equity securities by any person or entity that beneficially owned, or would have owned following a proposed transfer, at least 6,200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 5.0% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares at the time. We refer to the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date as the Old Common Stock.

DIP Financing
 
In connection with the Chapter 11 Case, on January 28, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Company's interim debtor-in-possession financing, or the DIP Financing, pursuant to terms set forth in a senior secured, superpriority debtor-in-possession credit agreement, or the DIP Credit Agreement, dated as of January 28, 2016, by and among the Company, as borrower, each lender from time to time party to the DIP Credit Agreement, including, but not limited to Deerfield Private Design Fund II, L.P., Deerfield Private Design International II, L.P., and Deerfield Special Situations Fund, L.P., to which we collectively refer as the Deerfield Lenders or Deerfield, and Deerfield Mgmt, L.P., as administrative agent, or DIP Agent, for the Deerfield Lenders. The Deerfield Lenders comprised 100% of the lenders under the then-existing facility agreement by and among the Company and the Deerfield Lenders, entered into as of March 31, 2014, as amended. We refer to this facility agreement, as amended, as the Deerfield Facility Agreement.
 
On March 9, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved on a final basis the Company's motion for approval of the DIP Credit Agreement and use of cash collateral, and approved a Waiver and First Amendment to the DIP Credit Agreement with the Deerfield Lenders and DIP Agent, or the Waiver and First Amendment, pursuant to which the DIP Credit Agreement was approved to include certain amendments, including the material terms of the proposed restructuring of the prepetition and post-petition secured debt, unsecured debt and equity interests of the Company, the terms of which were eventually effected pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. The Waiver and First Amendment provided for senior secured loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $6,000,000 in post-petition financing, to which we refer collectively as the DIP Loans. In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, as of the Effective Date, the DIP Credit Agreement was terminated.
  
Plan of Reorganization and Emergence from Bankruptcy
 
On April 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order Granting Final Approval of Disclosure Statement and Confirming Debtor’s Plan of Reorganization, which confirmed the Modified First Amended Plan of Reorganization of the Debtor under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. We refer to the order as the Confirmation Order and to the plan of reorganization, as confirmed by the Confirmation Order, as the Plan of Reorganization.
 
The Plan of Reorganization contemplated that, prior to the effective date of such plan (which would occur no later than May 5, 2016), the Company would seek to raise not less than $10,500,000 in funding (of which $3,000,000 could be in the form of backstop irrevocable capital call commitments from creditworthy obligors in the reasonable judgment of the Deerfield Lenders) through a private placement of common stock of the reorganized Company (the "Recapitalization Transaction"). If the Company were unable to achieve this successful capital raise, then the Plan of Reorganization contemplated alternative treatment of certain claims and equity interests. The proposed treatment of claims and equity interests in the event of a successful capital raise was defined in the Plan of Reorganization as Scenario A.
 
The Company having met the conditions contemplated for the successful capital raise, and therefore Scenario A, the Plan of Reorganization became effective on May 5, 2016, to which we refer as the Effective Date. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, as of the Effective Date (i) all equity interests of the Company, including but not limited to all shares of the Company’s Old Common Stock (including its redeemable common stock), warrants and options, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date were cancelled, (ii) the Company’s certificate of incorporation in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date was amended and restated in its entirety by its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation filed with the State of Delaware, as described in the Company’s Form 8-A filed on May 10, 2016 (such description is incorporated herein by reference), (iii) the Company’s by-laws in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date were amended and restated in their entirety by its Amended and Restated By-Laws, as described in the Company’s Form 8-A filed on May 10, 2016 (such description is incorporated herein by reference), and (iv) the Company issued new common stock, warrants and Series A preferred stock. Unless the context otherwise indicates, references in this report to New Common Stock are to the new common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and references in this report to Series A Preferred Stock are to the new preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, in each case issued by the Company on and after the Effective Date.

Under the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, it has the authority to issue a total of 32,500,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 31,500,000 shares of New Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which will have such rights, powers and preferences as the board of directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) shall determine.
 
The Plan of Reorganization and the Confirmation Order were filed as Exhibits 2.1 and 99.1, respectively, to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 28, 2016.
 
New Common Stock
 
Recapitalization
 
In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, as of the Effective Date, the Company issued 7,500,000 shares of New Common Stock to certain accredited investors for gross cash proceeds of $7,300,000 and net cash to the Company of $7,052,500. We refer to this transaction as the Recapitalization Financing. 200,000 of the 7,500,000 shares of New Common Stock were issued in partial payment of an advisory fee. The net cash amount excludes the effect of $100,000 in offering expenses paid from the proceeds of the DIP Financing, which was converted into Series A Preferred Stock as of the Effective Date as described below under “- Series A Preferred Stock.” 
 
As part of the Recapitalization Financing, the Company also issued warrants to purchase 6,180,000 shares of New Common Stock to certain of the investors in that financing. We refer to these warrants as the Warrants. The Warrants terminate on May 5, 2021 and are exercisable at any time on or after November 5, 2016 at exercise prices ranging from $0.50 per share to $1.00 per share. The number of shares of New Common Stock underlying a Warrant and its exercise price are subject to customary adjustments upon subdivisions, combinations, payment of stock dividends, reclassifications, reorganizations and consolidations. The Form of Warrant was attached as Exhibit 10.4 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 10, 2016.
 
The shares of New Common Stock and Warrants were issued to the investors in the Recapitalization Financing pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 promulgated thereunder.
 
A significant majority of the investors executed backstop commitments to purchase up to 12,800,000 additional shares of New Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $3,000,000 at an average per share purchase price of $0.2344. We refer to these backstop commitments as the Backstop Commitments or the Backstop Commitment. The Company cannot call the Backstop Commitment prior to June 30, 2017. The form of Backstop Commitment was attached as Exhibit 10.46 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on October 24, 2016.
 
With respect to each investor who executed a Backstop Commitment, the commitment terminates on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company receives net proceeds (after deducting all costs, expenses and commissions) from the sale of New Common Stock in the aggregate amount of the Backstop Commitment, (ii) the date that all shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been redeemed by the Company or (iii) the date that all shares of Series A Preferred Stock are no longer owned by entities affiliated with the Deerfield Lenders. We refer to such date as the Termination Date. Under the terms of the Backstop Commitment, the Company is obligated to pay to the committed investors upon the Termination Date a commitment fee of $250,000 in the aggregate.
 
As of the Effective Date, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, or the Registration Rights Agreement, with the investors. The Registration Rights Agreement provides certain resale registration rights to the investors with respect to the shares of New Common Stock issued in the Recapitalization Financing. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company filed a registration statement (File No. 333-214748) registering the resale of the New Common Stock issued in the Recapitalization Financing. The Company has agreed under the Registration Rights Agreement to use its best efforts to keep the registration statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until the earliest of (i) the date when all registrable securities under the registration statement may be sold without registration or restriction pursuant to Rule 144(b) under the Securities Act or any successor provision or (ii) the date when all registrable securities under the registration statement have been sold, subject to the Company’s ability to suspend sales under the registration statement in certain circumstances. The form of Registration Rights Agreement was attached as Exhibit 10.3 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 10, 2016.

Issuance of New Common Stock to Holders of Old Common Stock
 
As of the Effective Date, the Company issued 2,264,612 shares of New Common Stock to record holders of the Old Common Stock as of March 28, 2016 who executed and timely delivered the required release documents no later than July 5, 2016 in accordance with the Confirmation Order and the Plan of Reorganization. We refer to these shares of New Common Stock as the Exchange Shares and to the holders of Old Common Stock who executed and timely delivered the required release documents as the Releasing Holders.
 
The 2,264,612 Exchange Shares were issued as of the Effective Date to Releasing Holders who asserted ownership of a number of shares of Old Common Stock that matched the Company’s records or could otherwise be confirmed, at a rate of one share of New Common Stock for every 41.8934 shares of Old Common Stock held by such holders as of March 28, 2016. In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, if the calculation would otherwise have resulted in the issuance to any Releasing Holder of a number of shares of New Common Stock that is not a whole number, then the number of shares actually issued to such Releasing Holder was determined by rounding down to the nearest number.
 
In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, the Exchange Shares were issued under the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 1145 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
 
Issuance of New Common Stock in Exchange for Administrative Claims
 
As of June 20, 2016, the Company issued 162,500 shares of New Common Stock pursuant to the Order Granting Application of the Ad Hoc Equity Committee Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 503(b)(3)(D) and 503(b)(4) for Allowance of Fees and Expenses Incurred in Making a Substantial Contribution, entered by the Bankruptcy Court on June 20, 2016. We refer to these shares of New Common Stock as the Administrative Claim Shares. The Administrative Claim Shares were issued to holders of administrative claims under sections 503(b)(3)(D) and 503(b)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code. Of the 162,500 shares, 100,000 shares were issued to outside counsel to the Ad Hoc Equity Committee of the Company’s equity holders as payment of all remaining allowed fees for legal services provided by such counsel, and 62,500 were issued to designees of the Ad Hoc Equity Committee who had granted loans in an aggregate amount of $62,500 to the Ad Hoc Equity Committee in December 2015 as repayment of such loans.
 
The Administrative Claim Shares were issued under the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 thereunder.
 
Series A Preferred Stock
 
On the Effective Date, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations of Series A Preferred Stock, or Certificate of Designations, with the Delaware Secretary of State, designating 29,038 shares of the Company’s undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, as Series A Preferred Stock. A copy of the Certificate of Designations was attached as Exhibit 3.3 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 10, 2016. On the Effective Date, the Company issued 29,038 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the Deerfield Lenders in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Deerfield Lenders did not receive any shares of New Common Stock or other equity interests in the Company other than the Series A Preferred Stock.
 
The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, is not convertible or redeemable and carries a liquidation preference of $29,038,000, which is required to be paid to holders of such Series A Preferred Stock before any payments are made with respect to shares of New Common Stock (and other capital stock that is not issued on parity or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock) upon a liquidation or change in control transaction. For so long as Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors and to have such director serve on a standing committee of the Board of Directors established to exercise powers of the Board of Directors in respect of decisions or actions relating to the Backstop Commitment. Lawrence Atinsky serves as the designee of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, which are all currently affiliates of Deerfield Management Company, L.P., of which Mr. Atinsky is a Partner. The Series A Preferred Stock have voting rights, voting with the New Common Stock as a single class, with each share of Series A Preferred Stock having the right to five votes, currently representing approximately one percent (1%) of the voting rights of the capital stock of the Company, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to approve certain transactions. Under the Certificate of Designations, for so long as the Backstop Commitment remains in effect, a majority of the members of the standing backstop committee of the Board of Directors may approve a drawdown under the Backstop Commitment. Among other restrictions, the Certificate of Designations for our Series A Preferred Stock limits the Company’s ability to (i) issue securities that are senior or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) incur debt (other than for working capital purposes not in excess of $3.0 million), (iii) issue securities that are junior to the Series A Preferred Stock and that provide certain consent rights to the holders of such junior securities in connection with a liquidation or contain certain liquidation preferences, (iv) pay dividends on or purchase shares of its capital stock, and (v) change the authorized number of members of its Board of Directors to a number other than five, in each case without the consent of holders representing at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares Series A Preferred Stock.

Assignment and Assumption Agreement; Transition Services Agreement
 
Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, on May 5, 2016, the Company entered into an assignment and assumption agreement, or Assignment and Assumption Agreement, with Deerfield SS, LLC, the designee of the Deerfield Lenders, to assign to the Assignee the Company’s rights, title and interest in and to its then-existing license agreement with Arthrex, Inc., or Arthrex, and to transfer and assign to Deerfield SS, LLC associated intellectual property owned by the Company and licensed under such agreement, as well as rights to collect royalty payments thereunder. We refer to Deerfield SS, LLC as the Assignee. This assignment and transfer was effected in exchange for a reduction of $15,000,000 in the amount of the allowed claim of the Deerfield Lenders pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. As a result of the assignment and transfer, the Aurix System currently represents the Company’s only commercial product offering.
 
Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, on May 5, 2016, the Company also entered into a transition services agreement, or Transition Services Agreement, with the Assignee. The Transition Services Agreement generally contemplates that, during a transition period, we will continue to provide for the manufacture and supply to Arthrex of the Angel product line in accordance with the terms of the existing license agreement with Arthrex, and to provide our full cooperation, as commercially reasonable, to assist Arthrex with the manufacture and supply of the Angel product line. Initially, our obligation to provide such transition services was not to extend beyond October 15, 2016 unless agreed between the Company and the Assignee. On October 20, 2016, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Arthrex and the Assignee, which extended the transition period under the Transition Services Agreement through January 15, 2017. We refer to this letter agreement as the Three Party Letter Agreement. Under the terms of the Three Party Letter Agreement, the Company has no further obligations under the Transition Services Agreement or the Amended Arthrex Agreement after January 15, 2017.
 
The Assignment and Assumption Agreement and Transition Services Agreement were attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 10, 2016, and are incorporated herein by reference. The Three Party Letter Agreement was attached as Exhibit 10.47 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on October 24, 2016.
 
Termination of Deerfield Facility Agreement and DIP Credit Agreement
 
On the Effective Date, the obligations of the Company under the Deerfield Facility Agreement and under the DIP Credit Agreement were cancelled in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization and the Company ceased to have any obligations thereunder.
Board of Directors
 
On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the size of the Board of Directors was fixed at five members, Stephen N. Keith resigned from the Board of Directors and Scott M. Pittman and Lawrence S. Atinsky were appointed to the Board of Directors. Joseph Del Guercio, David E. Jorden and C. Eric Winzer remained on the Board of Directors. Mr. Atinsky was appointed to the Board of Directors by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.
Trading in the New Common Stock

Quotation of the New Common Stock commenced on OTCQB on January 20, 2017 under the trading symbol “AURX” and was moved to OTCQX as of March 16, 2017. On March 6, 2017, the shares of New Common Stock became eligible for Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian, or DWAC, distribution through The Depository Trust Company, or DTC. DWAC transfer allows brokers and custodial banks to make electronic book-entry deposits and withdrawals of shares of common stock into and out of their DTC book-entry accounts using a “Fast Automated Securities Transfer”, or FAST, service. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report, trading in our New Common Stock has been very limited and we cannot make any assurances that the trading volume will increase, or, if and when it increases, that it will be sustained at any level.

Our Business 
 
Nuo Therapeutics is a regenerative therapies company developing and marketing products primarily within the U.S. We commercialize innovative cell-based technologies that harness the regenerative capacity of the human body to trigger natural healing. The use of autologous (from self) biological therapies for tissue repair and regeneration is part of a transformative clinical strategy designed to improve long term recovery in complex chronic conditions with significant unmet medical needs.
 
Our current commercial offering consists of a point of care technology for the safe and efficient separation of autologous blood to produce a platelet based therapy for the chronic wound care market (the "Aurix System"). Prior to May 5, 2016, we had two distinct Platelet Rich Plasma, or PRP, devices, the Aurix System for chronic wound care, and the Angel concentrated PRP, or cPRP, system for usage generally within the orthopedics market. Approximately 91% of our product sales during the year ended December 31, 2016 were in the United States, where we sold Aurix through direct sales representatives and Angel (until the Effective Date) via our distribution agreements with Arthrex. All product sales for the Successor Company since May 5, 2016 were in the United States. 
 
As described above under “Bankruptcy and Emergence from Bankruptcy,” on May 5, 2016 the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with the Assignee, as the designee of the Deerfield Lenders, to assign to the Assignee the Company’s rights, title and interest in and to its existing license agreement with Arthrex, and to transfer and assign to the Assignee associated intellectual property owned by the Company and licensed under such agreement, as well as rights to collect royalty payments thereunder. On May 5, 2016, the Company and the Assignee also entered into a Transition Services Agreement in which the Company agreed to continue to service its existing license agreement with Arthrex for a transition period. As a result of the assignment and transfer, the Aurix System currently represents our only commercial product offering.
 
Growth opportunities for the Aurix System in the United States in the near to intermediate term include the treatment of chronic wounds with Aurix in (i) the Medicare population under a National Coverage Determination, or NCD, when registry data is collected under the Coverage with Evidence Development, or CED, program of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS and (ii) the Veterans Affairs, or VA, healthcare system and other federal accounts settings.
 
CED allows coverage of certain items or services where additional data gathered in the context of clinical care would further clarify the impact of these items and services on the health of Medicare beneficiaries. According to guidance issued by CMS in 2006, "[t]he purpose of [the] CED program is to generate data on the utilization and impact of the item or service evaluated in the NCD, so that Medicare can a) document the appropriateness of use of that item or service in Medicare beneficiaries under current coverage; b) consider future changes in coverage for the item or service; c) generate clinical information that will improve the evidence base on which providers base their recommendations to Medicare beneficiaries regarding the item or service" (Guidance for the Public, Industry and CMS Staff: National Coverage Determinations with Data Collection as a Condition of Coverage: Coverage with Evidence Development, July 12, 2006).
 
Aurix System
 
In October 2014, we relaunched our AutoloGel chronic wound care system under the Aurix brand, as a part of a strategic plan for the commercialization of Aurix in the U.S. chronic wound care market.
 
The Aurix System is a point of care device for the rapid production of a platelet based bioactive wound treatment derived from a small sample of the patient’s own blood. Aurix is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use on exuding wounds and is currently marketed in the chronic wound market. The advanced wound care market, within which Aurix competes, is composed of advanced wound care dressings, wound care devices, and wound care biologics, and is estimated to be an approximate $12.5 billion global market according to the visiongain Advanced Wound Care Market Forecast 2015-2025, published in 2015. The most significant growth opportunity for Aurix is the 2012 NCD from CMS, which reversed a twenty year old non-coverage decision for autologous blood derived products used in wound care. The Company’s collaboration with Restorix Health, Inc., or Restorix, (as described below) is strategically intended to drive patient enrollment in the data registry protocols being conducted under the CED program.

Using the patient’s own platelets as a therapeutic agent, Aurix harnesses the body’s natural healing processes to deliver growth factors, chemokines and cytokines known to promote angiogenesis and to regulate cell growth and the formation of new tissue. Once applied to the prepared wound bed, the biologically active platelet gel can restore the balance in the wound environment to transform a non-healing wound to a wound that heals naturally. There have been nine peer-reviewed scientific and clinical publications demonstrating the effectiveness of Aurix in the management of chronic wounds since the device and gel was cleared by the FDA in 2007.
 
CMS previously advised us that payment levels for reimbursement claims with respect to Aurix would be reviewed annually and subject to change. Any decision by CMS to decrease payment rates for reimbursement claims will negatively impact the Company's economic value proposition for Aurix in the market for advanced wound care therapies, and could have material adverse effects on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.
 
In July 2015, CMS released the proposed Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, or HOPPS, rule for calendar year 2016. In it, CMS proposed a national average reimbursement rate for calendar year 2016 of $305 per Aurix treatment. The Company worked with CMS to establish a higher rate in the CMS’ final rule for calendar year 2016 issued on October 30, 2015. The final national average reimbursement rate under HOPPS for calendar year 2016 was established at $1,411 per treatment effective January 1, 2016, with Aurix placed in Ambulatory Payment Classification, or APC, 5054 (Level 4 Skin Procedures). In the text of the ruling, CMS commented they believed the geometric mean cost of the services underlying Aurix is comparable to the geometric mean cost of APC 5054. In November 2016, the final national reimbursement rate for 2017 was established at $1,427 with Aurix remaining in APC 5054. 
 
The Company’s Aurix revenues in VA facilities are unaffected by CMS determined reimbursement rates, as the Company establishes an agreed price on the Federal Supply Schedule (currently $600/Aurix kit) for use of Aurix in federal healthcare facilities.
 
In September 2009, we entered into an original license and distribution agreement with Millennia Holdings, Inc., or Millennia, for the Company’s Aurix System in Japan.
 
In January 2015, we granted to Rohto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Rohto, a royalty bearing, nontransferable, exclusive license, with limited right to sublicense, to use certain of the Company’s intellectual property for the development, import, use, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution for all wound care and topical dermatology applications of the Aurix System and related intellectual property and know-how in human and veterinary medicine in Japan in exchange for an upfront payment from Rohto of $3.0 million. The agreement also contemplates additional royalty payments based on the net sales of Aurix in Japan and an additional cash payment of $1.0 million if and when the reimbursement price for the national health insurance system in Japan has been achieved after marketing authorization as described below.
 
In conjunction with the Rohto license, we amended our licensing and distribution agreement with Millennia to terminate the agreement and to allow us to transfer the Japanese exclusivity rights from Millennia to Rohto. In connection with this amendment, we paid a one-time, non-refundable fee of $1.5 million to Millennia upon our receipt of the $3.0 million upfront payment from Rohto, are required to make a one-time, non-refundable payment of $0.5 million upon our receipt of the $1.0 million milestone payment from Rohto, and may be required to make future royalty payments to Millennia based upon net sales in Japan. Millennia has been instrumental in establishing the advanced wound care market in Japan, and will continue to work with Rohto to develop the market for Aurix in that market. Further, Rohto has assumed responsibility for securing the marketing authorization from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, while we will provide relevant product information, as well as clinical and other data to support Rohto’s regulatory initiatives.

The license agreement with Rohto and the amendment to our licensing and distribution agreement with Millennia are attached as Exhibits 10.32 and 10.33, respectively, to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on October 24, 2016.
 
On March 22, 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Restorix, pursuant to which we agreed to provide Restorix with certain limited geographic exclusivity benefits over a defined period of time for the usage of the Aurix System in up to 30 of the approximately 125 hospital outpatient wound care clinics with which Restorix has a management contract, or the RXH Partner Hospitals, in exchange for Restorix making minimum commitments of patients enrolled in three prospective clinical research studies primarily consisting of patient data collection, or the Protocols, necessary to maintain exclusivity under the Collaboration Agreement. The Collaboration Agreement will initially continue for a two-year period, subject to one or more extensions with the mutual consent of the parties.
 
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, the Company agreed to provide: (i) clinical support services by its clinical staff as reasonably agreed between the Company and Restorix as necessary and appropriate, (ii) reasonable and necessary support regarding certain reimbursement activities, (iii) coverage of Institutional Review Board, or IRB, fees and payment to Restorix for certain training costs subject to certain limitations, (iv) an administrative fee for each fully completed and transmitted patient data set, and (v) community-focused public relations materials for participating RXH Partner Hospitals to promote the use of Aurix and participation in the Protocols. Under the Collaboration Agreement, each RXH Partner Hospital will pay the Company the then-current product price ($700 in 2016, and no greater than $750 for the remainder of the initial term) as set forth in the Collaboration Agreement.

Angel Product Line
 
The Angel cPRP System, acquired from Sorin Group USA, Inc. in April 2010, is designed for single-patient use at the point of care, and provides a simple and flexible means for producing quality concentrated PRP and platelet poor plasma, or PPP, from a small sample of whole blood or bone marrow. The Angel cPRP System is a multi-functional cell separation device which produces cPRP for use in the operating room and clinic and is generally used in a range of orthopedic indications.
 
In August 2013, we entered into a Distributor and License Agreement with Arthrex. Under the terms of this agreement, Arthrex obtained the exclusive rights to sell, distribute, and service the Angel cPRP System and activAT throughout the world for all uses other than chronic wound care. We granted Arthrex a limited license to use our intellectual property as part of enabling Arthrex to sell these products. Pursuant to this license, Arthrex purchased these products from us at cost to distribute and service in exchange for payments based on a certain royalty rate depending on volume of the products sold. As described below, we have assigned the right to this royalty stream to Deerfield SS, LLC pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization.
 
On October 16, 2015, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement, or the Amended Arthrex Agreement, with Arthrex, which amended and restated the original agreement. Under the terms of the Amended Arthrex Agreement, the Company granted Arthrex an exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, transferable license to the Angel Patents (as defined in the following sentence) to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, distribute and have distributed, import and have imported, the Angel® Concentrated Platelet System, or Angel, product line (including, without limitation, the activeAT disposables and associated components) and certain new enhanced products within the Exclusive Field of Use (as defined in the following sentence) and (B) a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, transferable license to the Angel Patents to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, distribute and have distributed, import and have imported, Angel and certain new enhanced products within (a) nonsurgical aesthetics markets in the United Kingdom and Ireland subject to certain license rights granted to Biotherapy Services Ltd. and (b) any wound care applications (i) worldwide, outside the United States, its territories and possessions and (ii) in the United Kingdom and Ireland subject to certain license rights granted to Biotherapy Services Ltd., or the Non-Exclusive Field of Use. For purposes of the Amended Arthrex Agreement, the Exclusive Field of Use consists of uses in human and veterinary applications except those described in the Non-Exclusive Field of Use, and Angel Patents are those patents used in the technology required, or previously used by the Company, to make, use and sell the Angel product line. The Company also transferred to Arthrex all of its rights and title to product registration and intellectual property (other than patents) related to Angel. In connection with the Amended Arthrex Agreement, the Deerfield Lenders irrevocably released their liens on the product registration rights and intellectual property assets (other than patents) transferred by the Company to Arthrex. The Amended Arthrex Agreement provided that, on a date to be determined by Arthrex, but not later than March 31, 2016, Arthrex would assume all rights related to the manufacture and supply of the Angel product line. The Amended Arthrex Agreement, as supplemented in April 2016, is referred to collectively as the Arthrex Agreement.

Under the Arthrex Agreement, the Company had the right to receive certain royalties through 2024. However, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, on May 5, 2016, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with the Assignee as the designee of the Deerfield Lenders, to assign to the Assignee the Company’s rights, title and interest in and to the Arthrex Agreement, and to transfer and assign to the Assignee associated intellectual property and royalty and payment rights owned by the Company and licensed thereunder. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, on May 5, 2016, the Company and the Assignee also entered into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to continue to service the Arthrex Agreement for a transition period. The Transition Services Agreement generally contemplates that, during this transition period, we will continue to provide for the manufacture and supply to Arthrex of the Angel product line in accordance with the terms of the Arthrex Agreement, and to provide our full cooperation, as commercially reasonable, to assist Arthrex with the manufacture and supply of the Angel product line, notwithstanding the original March 31, 2016 assumption deadline for Arthrex described above. Initially, our obligation to provide such transition services was not to extend beyond October 15, 2016 unless agreed between the Company and the Assignee.
 
On October 20, 2016, the Company entered into the Three Party Letter Agreement with Arthrex and the Assignee, which extended the transition period under the Transition Services Agreement through January 15, 2017. Under the terms of the Three Party Letter Agreement, subject to Arthrex making a payment of $201,200 to the Company on October 28, 2016, (a) the Company has sold, conveyed, transferred and assigned to Arthrex its title and interest in the Company’s inventory of Angel products (including spare parts therefor) and production equipment, and (b) the Assignee is obligated to make three equal payments of $33,333.33 each to the Company as consideration for the extension of the transition period. Under the terms of the Three Party Letter Agreement, the Company has no further obligations under the Transition Services Agreement or the Amended Arthrex Agreement after January 15, 2017. The agreement contains a full and irrevocable release of Arthrex by the Company with respect to any actions, claims or other liabilities for payments of Royalty (as defined in the Amended Arthrex Agreement) owed to the Company based on sales of Angel products occurring on or before June 30, 2016, and a full and irrevocable release of the Company and the Assignee by Arthrex with respect to any actions, claims or other liabilities arising under the Amended Arthrex Agreement as of the date of the Three Party Letter Agreement. Neither Arthrex nor the Assignee assumed any liabilities or obligations of the Company in connection with the Three Party Letter Agreement. 
 
ALDHbr, or Bright Cell, Technology
 
The Company acquired the ALDHbr “Bright Cell” technology as part of our acquisition of Aldagen in February 2012. The Bright Cell technology utilizes an intracellular enzyme marker and proprietary separation process to fractionate regenerative cells from a patient's bone marrow.   Elements of this core technology were originally licensed by Aldagen from Duke University and Johns Hopkins University (JHU). 
 
Following the January 2014 completion of the trial enrollment in the RECOVER-Stroke trial, in May 2014 we announced preliminary efficacy and safety results of this Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with neurological damage arising from ischemic stroke and treated with ALD-401. Observed improvements in the primary endpoint (mean modified Rankin Score) of the trial were not clinically or statistically significant. In light of this outcome, we discontinued further direct funding of the clinical development program, and in connection therewith, closed the Aldagen research and development facility in Durham, NC.
  
Notwithstanding the discontinuation of further direct funding of clinical development, a then-ongoing Phase 2 clinical study (PACE) in intermittent claudication (a condition associated with peripheral arterial disease) continued under the sole funding of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, or the NHLBI, a division of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and in collaboration with the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network. This study enrolled 82 patients and trial enrollment concluded in January 2016. The initial PACE study results were presented during a clinical session at the American Heart Association meeting in November 2016.  There were no significant differences from baseline to 6 months between the cell and placebo groups for the four co-primary endpoints.  Additionally, there were no significant improvements for quality of life secondary endpoints, nor correlative relationships between changes in magnetic resonance outcomes and peak walking time. In light of the lack of any clinical response of statistical significance and limited remaining patent life, the Company sees no further realistic path for development of the technology, and does not expect to maintain the international patent rights around the related intellectual property. The Company will continue to receive limited royalty and license fee revenue from its license of certain aspects of the ALDH technology to StemCell Technologies for the Aldeflour product line.

Customer Concentration
 
In 2016, our revenues consisted of product sales of approximately $1.3 million, license fee revenue of approximately $0.1 million and royalties of approximately $0.8 million. In 2016, revenue from Arthrex accounted for approximately 61% of our total revenue. For the Successor Company, revenue from STEMCELL Technologies and St. Luke's Hospital System accounted for approximately 22% and 16%, respectively, of total revenue for the period from May 5, 2016 through December 31, 2016. For the Predecessor Company, revenue from Arthrex accounted for approximately 78% of total revenue for the period from January 1, 2016 through May 4, 2016. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue during those periods.
 
In 2015, our revenues consisted of product sales of approximately $6.4 million, license fee revenue of approximately $3.4 million (related primarily to a one-time license fee paid under the Rohto agreement) and royalties of approximately $1.7 million. In 2015, revenue attributed to Arthrex accounted for approximately 67% of our total revenue and revenue attributed to Rhoto accounted for approximately 26% of our total revenue. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during 2015. 
 
Patents, Licenses, and Property Rights 
 
Nuo Therapeutics relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, contractual provisions, and other similar measures, to establish and protect its intellectual property.
 
Historically, the Company has been party to certain royalty agreements relating to its intellectual property under which it pays certain fees, and has acquired additional royalty agreements as part of the acquisition of Aldagen. Currently, the Company is paying royalties under the following agreements:
 

● | The inventor is entitled to receive a royalty equal to 5% of gross profits on revenues generated from reliance on the Worden Patents (U.S. patents 6,303,112 and 6,524,568), covering the formulation of Aurix. In conjunction with the release of a security interest in the applicable patents securing our payment obligations under a royalty agreement, we paid the inventor a lump sum $500,000 payment in February 2013 in satisfaction of all remaining minimum monthly royalty payments. In addition, the annual maximum royalty payment was raised to $625,000 from $600,000 in conjunction with the amendment. Finally, the Company has no annual royalty obligation unless and until the calculated annual royalty obligation exceeds $100,000 in a given year. This agreement terminates with the expiration of the patents in 2019. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Under our license agreement with Duke, Duke has granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under its patents and applications that relate to methods for isolating and manufacturing ALDH Bright Cell populations, or the Duke Patents. Under the terms of the Duke license agreement, we are obligated to pay up to a 1% royalty to Duke on all revenues relating to the Duke Patents, subject to an annual minimum of $5,000 per year beginning in the calendar year after the first commercial sale of a licensed product (which will increase to $25,000 upon the achievement of specified development and commercialization milestones). The Company bears all costs to maintain the patents. This agreement terminates with the expiration of the patents in 2018. In light of the lack of any clinical response of statistical significance and limited remaining patent life, the Company sees no further realistic path for development of the Bright Cell technology, and it does not expect to maintain the international patent rights around the related intellectual property.

Nuo Therapeutics’ patent strategy, designed to maximize value, seeks to: (i) assist the Company in establishing significant market positions for its products, (ii) attract strategic partners for collaborative research, development, marketing, distribution, or other agreements, which could include milestone payments to the Company, and (iii) generate revenue streams via out-licensing agreements.
Nuo Therapeutics’ current patent portfolio consists of domestic and international patents that generally fall into the following families:
 

● | Process, formulation, and methods for utilizing platelet releasates to heal damaged tissue, related to PCT/US99/02981 and US Patent Nos. 7,112,342 and 6,524,568;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patents having claims to medical devices, corresponding to PCT/US2010/051892 and US Patent No. 7,927,563;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ALDH Bright Cell populations, related to US Patent Nos. 7,863,043, 8,986,744, and 6,537,807; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Specific chemistries for isolating and manufacturing ALDH Bright Cell populations, related to US Patent Nos. 6,627,759, 6,991,897, and 7,754,480.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The above patent families encompass the Company’s Aurix product, homologous growth factors, wound-healing biomarkers and ALDH Bright Cell populations. Nuo Therapeutics is continually assessing new opportunities to create or in-license other intellectual property assets. These patents have expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2030. As described in “Angel Product Line” above, the Company has assigned to the Assignee the Company’s rights, title and interest in and to the Arthrex Agreement, and transferred and assigned to the Assignee associated intellectual property and royalty and payment rights owned by the Company and licensed thereunder. In addition, as described in "ALDHbr, or Bright Cell, Technology" above,  the Company does not intend to maintain the international patent rights surrounding the Bright Cell technology. As such, international patent rights relating to the Bright Cell technology do not appear above. 
 
Business Strategy
 
Our corporate and strategic focus is on the successful execution and completion of the clinical data registry protocols of Aurix under the CMS CED program. Only upon the successful conclusion of those data collection efforts and the submission of the resulting data to CMS can broad access and unhindered commercial reimbursement of Aurix be achieved (although there are no assurances that broad access and unhindered commercial reimbursement will in fact be achieved). Such an occurrence would substantially broaden the access to a novel therapeutic such as Aurix among Medicare beneficiaries which represent the majority of chronic wound patients in the United States. We believe that the market for innovative cell-based technologies that harness the regenerative capacity of the human body to trigger natural healing represents a significant opportunity from both a medical and a business perspective. Our immediate goal remains to successfully commercialize our Aurix System. Key elements of our strategy to achieve these goals include:

● | To advance the commercialization of Aurix for the treatment of chronic wound care in the U.S., we have initiated a collaboration with Restorix, a leading wound care management company operating approximately 125 outpatient wound care facilities generally as a part of a broader hospital facility. The CED data registry protocols require the collection of wound healing data including Quality of Life metrics for a study population of approximately 2,200 total patients across three separate wound etiology protocols. The Restorix collaboration is intended to efficiently and effectively enroll these patients in a coordinated manner. We have also deployed a modest direct sales force focused on clinical and commercial adoption within the Veterans Affairs medical system as well as other federal healthcare facilities. To support our CED efforts, we have also hired and deployed a small team of clinical affairs professionals. The clinical affairs group is focused on both support of health care providers and facilities in their use of Aurix as well as facilitating the collection of the clinical data required to fulfill the Aurix Medicare CED requirements.

 | While we are currently focused on the commercialization of our FDA-cleared Aurix System in the U.S., a secondary priority for us is to locate strategic resources to support the continued development and commercial introduction of our products in markets outside the U.S. In furtherance thereof, in January 2015 we signed an exclusive licensing and distribution agreement for the Aurix System with Rohto providing them with an exclusive license and the right to develop and commercialize Aurix in the Japanese market. The agreement also contemplates additional royalty payments based on the net sales of Aurix in Japan and an additional future cash payment in the event a specific milestone is met. Rohto has assumed all responsibility for securing the marketing authorization from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare while we will provide relevant product information, as well as clinical and other data to support Rohto’s regulatory activities. Effective as of May 5, 2016, we entered into an exclusive licensing and distribution agreement for the Aurix System with Boyalife. Under this agreement, Boyalife received a non-transferable, exclusive license, with limited right to sublicense, to use certain of the intellectual property relating to our Aurix System. Under the agreement, Boyalife is entitled to import, use for development, promote, market, sell and distribute Aurix in greater China (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau) for all regenerative medicine applications, including but not limited to wound care and topical dermatology applications in human and veterinary medicine. For additional detail on the Rohto and Boyalife agreements, please refer to “- The Aurix System” above.

● | An important priority for us is to manage our overall costs and expenditures while focusing on the completion of the CED protocols. We will require significant additional capital over time to fully support an expanded commercialization initiative designed to increase market adoption and penetration of Aurix after completion of the CED protocols. See, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and other countries extensively regulate pharmaceutical products, biologics, and medical devices. The Company’s products and product candidates are subject to approval or clearance by the governing bodies prior to and during the marketing and distribution of a product. Regulatory requirements apply to, but are not limited to, research and development, safety and efficacy, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, advertising and marketing, and the import and export of products. Before a product candidate is approved by the governing bodies for commercial marketing, rigorous preclinical and human clinical testing may be necessary to conduct to determine the safety and efficacy or effectiveness of the product. If the Company fails to comply with the applicable laws and regulations at any time during the product development process, approval or clearance process, or during commercialization, it may become subject to administrative and/or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, refusal to approve or clear pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of the Company’s operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Any enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 

 13



Medical Device Regulation
 
The Company currently manufactures and distributes the Aurix System. As such, this and future products manufactured and/or distributed by the Company may be subject to regulations by the applicable governing bodies, including but not limited to, the FDA, Health Canada, the European Medicines Agency, the Japanese Ministry of Health & Welfare, and other regulatory agencies. The Company currently has limited business development initiatives outside of the U.S. Each of the foreign governing bodies noted above serve a similar function as the FDA. As such, the Company and its products and product candidates are subject to the regulations enforced by the outside governing bodies. These regulations include, but are not limited to, product clearance, documentation requirements, good manufacturing practices and medical device reporting. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, in certain circumstances. Current enforcement policies prohibit the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. Each governing body reviews the labeling and advertising of medical devices to ensure that unapproved uses are not promoted. Before a new medical device can be introduced to the market, the manufacturer must obtain clearance or approval from the applicable regulatory agency, depending upon the device classification. In the U.S., medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, II, or III. The regulations enforced by the FDA and/or the appropriate governing bodies to the medical device(s) provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. In the U.S., Class I devices are non-critical products that the FDA believes can be adequately regulated by “general controls” which include provisions relating to labeling, manufacturer registration, defect notification, records and reports, and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, based on the FDA’s Quality Systems Regulations. Most Class I devices are exempt from pre-market notification and some are also exempt from cGMP requirements. Class II devices are products for which the general controls of Class I devices, by themselves, are not sufficient to assure safety and effectiveness and, therefore, require additional controls. Additional controls for Class II devices may include performance standards, post-market surveillance patient registries, and the use of FDA guidelines. Standards may include both design and performance requirements. Class III devices have the most restrictive controls and require pre-market approval by the FDA. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. All of the governing bodies with responsibility over the Company’s products have the ability to inspect medical device manufacturers, order recalls of medical devices in some circumstances, seize non-complying medical devices, and to pursue prosecution of either civil or criminal violations.
 
Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, requires individuals or companies manufacturing medical devices intended for human use to file a notice with the FDA at least ninety days before intending to introduce the device into the market. This notice, commonly referred to as a 510(k) premarket notification, must identify the type of classified device into which the product falls, the class of that type, and a specific product already being marketed or cleared by the FDA and to which the product is “substantially equivalent.” In some instances, the 510(k) must include data from human clinical studies to establish “substantial equivalence.” The FDA must agree with the claim of “substantial equivalence” before the device can be marketed. The statutory time frame for clearance of a 510(k) is ninety days, though it often takes longer. Nuo Therapeutics currently markets only products that are subject to 510(k) clearance.
 
The Company currently markets the Aurix System, consisting of the Aurix Wound Dressing Kit, Aurix Reagent Kit, and Aurix System Centrifuge II. Each System’s component is a legally-marketed product that has been cleared by FDA and/or the appropriate governing body. The Aurix System Centrifuge II, when used with the Aurix Wound Dressing Kit and Aurix Reagent Kit, are suitable for use on exuding wounds such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and diabetic ulcers, and for the management of mechanically or surgically-debrided wounds.
As a specification developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical devices, Nuo Therapeutics complies with, among other standards and regulations, e.g., the FDCA and implementing regulations at 21 CFR et seq. and ISO 13485. As a manufacturer and distributor of medical devices, the Company, and in some instances its subcontractors, is required to register its facilities and products manufactured annually with the appropriate governing bodies and certain state agencies. Additionally, the Company is subject to periodic inspections by the governing bodies to assess compliance with cGMP regulations. Facilities may also be subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

Bio-pharmaceutical Product Regulation
 
To the extent the Company again develops bio-pharmaceuticals, such as its former ALDH Bright Cells product candidates, in the future, they would also be regulated by the FDA. Under the U.S. regulatory scheme, the development process for new such products can be divided into two distinct phases:

● | Preclinical Phase. The preclinical phase involves the discovery, characterization, product formulation and animal testing necessary to prepare an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for submission to the FDA. The IND must be accepted by the FDA before the product candidate can be tested in humans. The review period for an IND submission is thirty days, after which, if no comments are made by the FDA, the product candidate can be studied in Phase I clinical trials. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical Phase. The clinical phase of development follows a successful IND submission and involves the activities necessary to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and dosage of the product candidate in humans, as well as, the ability to manufacture the drug in accordance with cGMP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the efficacy of the product candidate. Each clinical protocol is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND prior to beginning the trial. Each trial is reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an investigational review board, or IRB, and each trial, with limited exceptions, must include the patient’s informed consent. Typically, clinical evaluation involves the following time-consuming and costly three-phase sequential process:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Phase 1. In Phase 1 clinical trials, typically a small number of healthy individuals (although in some instances individuals with the disease or condition for which an indication is being sought for the product candidate are enrolled) are tested with the product candidate to determine safety and tolerability, and includes biological analyses to determine the availability and metabolism of the active ingredient following administration.
 
Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials involve administering the product candidate to individuals who suffer from the target disease or condition to determine the optimal dose and potential efficacy. These clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects.
 
Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting efficacy of a product candidate has been obtained and safety, tolerability, and an optimal dosing regimen have been established. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to gather additional information about efficacy and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship and to complete the information needed to provide adequate instructions for the use of the product candidate. Phase 3 trials usually include from several hundred to a few thousand subjects.
 
Throughout the clinical phase, samples of the product made in different batches are tested for stability to establish shelf-life constraints. In addition, large-scale production protocols and written standard operating procedures for each aspect of commercial manufacture and testing must be developed. These trials require scale up for manufacture of increasingly larger batches of bulk chemical. These batches require validation analyses to confirm the consistent composition of the product.
  
Phase 1, 2, and 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend (place on “clinical hold”), or terminate the trials based upon the data accumulated to that point and the agency’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. The FDA may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. Additionally, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of products under development. Furthermore, IRBs, which are independent entities constituted to protect human subjects at the institutions in which clinical trials are being conducted, have the authority to suspend clinical trials at their respective institutions at any time for a variety of reasons, including safety issues.
 
 15



After the successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials, the sponsor of the new bio-pharmaceutical submits a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. A BLA is a comprehensive, multi-volume application that includes, among other things, the results of all preclinical studies and clinical trials, information about the product candidate’s composition and manufacturing, and the sponsor’s plans for manufacturing, packaging, and labeling the drug. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an application also is required to include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and efficacy of product candidates for all relevant pediatric populations before the BLA is submitted. The statute provides for waivers or deferrals in certain situations. In most cases, the BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. In return, the FDA assigns a goal of 10 months from acceptance of the application to return of a first “complete response,” in which the FDA may approve the product or request additional information.
 
The submission of the application is no guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. The FDA reviews all BLA’s submitted before it accepts them for filing. It may refuse to accept the application and request additional information rather than accept the application for filing, in which case, the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. After the application is deemed filed and accepted by the FDA, agency staff reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and efficacious for its intended use. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with an applicant’s interpretation of the data submitted in its BLA. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of physicians, for review, evaluation, and an approval recommendation. The FDA is not bound by the opinion of the advisory committee. Products that successfully complete BLA review and receive clearance (i.e., approval) may be marketed in the U.S., subject to all conditions imposed by the FDA.
 
Prior to granting approval, the FDA conducts an inspection of the facilities, including outsourced facilities, that will be involved in the manufacture, production, packaging, testing, and control of the product candidate for cGMP compliance. The FDA will not approve the application unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If FDA determines that the marketing application, manufacturing process, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and will often request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the marketing application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the application by issuing a “complete response” letter communicating it cannot approve the application in its current form. The length of the FDA’s review may range from a few months to several years.
 
If the FDA approves the BLA, the product becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the U.S. After approval, the BLA holder is still subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record keeping requirements, submitting periodic reports to the FDA, reporting of any adverse experiences with the product, and complying with drug sampling and distribution requirements. In addition, the BLA holder is required to maintain and provide updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA. The BLA holder is also required to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling, including prohibitions against promoting any non-FDA approved or “off-label” indications of products. Failure to comply with those requirements could result in significant enforcement action by the FDA, including warning letters, orders to pull the promotional materials, and substantial fines. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval.
 
Biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities and products manufactured annually with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP regulations. Facilities may also be subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

In addition, following the FDA approval of a product, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved marketing application, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary or the FDA-initiated action that could delay further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contra-indications. Also, the FDA may require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or effectiveness, including additional clinical studies, known as Phase 4 trials, to evaluate long-term effects.
 
Other regulatory agencies, including Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency, require preclinical and clinical studies, manufacturing validation, facilities inspection, and post-approval record keeping and reporting similar to FDA requirements. In some instances, data generated for consideration by the FDA may be submitted to these agencies for their consideration for approvals in other countries.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
The Company may also be indirectly subject to federal and state anti-kickback and physician self-referral laws. Federal physician self-referral legislation (commonly known as the Stark Law) prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral, and any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral is obligated to refund such amounts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or “CMS,” has issued numerous regulations containing exceptions to the prohibitions of the Stark Law. If a physician and a DHS entity have financial relationship subject to the Stark Law, then an exception must be met or else the DHS entity cannot bill for the service. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. The penalties for violating the Stark Law also include civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per referral and possible exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the Stark Law have also been the basis for False Claims Act actions, discussed below. Various states have corollary laws to the Stark Law (so-called “baby Stark” laws), including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a health care provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. Both the scope and exception for such laws vary from state to state.
 
The Company may also be subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws. Section 1128B (b) of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Law, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Law is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. The Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, has issued regulations, commonly known as “safe harbors” that set forth certain provisions which, if fully met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Law. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Law will be pursued. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Law include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $250,000 per violation for individuals and up to $500,000 per violation for companies and possible exclusion from federal health care programs. As with the Stark Law, violations of the Anti-Kickback Law can result in a False Claims Act action. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law, and some of these state prohibitions apply to patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not only federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In this connection, please refer to the Risk Factor titled "The 20% Medicare Co-Payment Presents a Potential Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols." 
 
In addition, there are other U.S. health care fraud laws to which the Company may be subject, one which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers (“fraud on a health benefit plan”) and one which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. These laws apply to any health benefit plan, not just Medicare and Medicaid.

The Company may also be subject to other U.S. laws which prohibit submitting, or causing to be submitted, claims for payment or causing such claims to be submitted that are false. Violation of these false claims statutes may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health programs. These statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the knowing filing of a false claim (or causing the submission of a false claim) or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the U.S. federal government. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the failure to report and refund an overpayment to the Medicare or Medicaid programs within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment may also be an obligation subjecting the defendant to a False Claims Act action. Finally, a recent U.S. Supreme Court case, Universal Health Services v. United States ex rel. Escobar, approved the “implied false certification” theory under which a defendant submits a claim for payment that makes a specific representation about the goods or services provider, but fails to disclose the defendant’s noncompliance with a statutory, regulatory or contractual requirement that would be material to the Government’s payment decision. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. These amounts are likely to increase dramatically in accordance with the provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, under which the U.S. Department of Justice adjusted for inflation civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by components of the Department. This change will increase the per claim penalty range to $10,781-$21,563. Suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by an individual on behalf of the government (a “qui tam action”). Such individuals (known as “qui tam relators”) may share in the amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition certain states have enacted laws modeled after the False Claims Act. “Qui tam” actions have increased significantly in recent years causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend false claim actions, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 
Several states also have referral, fee splitting and other similar laws that may restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration in connection with the purchase or rental of medical equipment and supplies. State laws vary in scope and have been infrequently interpreted by courts and regulatory agencies, but may apply to all health care products and services, regardless of whether Medicaid or Medicare funds are involved.

Competition
 
While Aurix has no direct competition in the chronic wound care market from any other FDA cleared platelet derived products, we face competition from pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and other competitors in the areas of advanced wound care dressings, wound care devices, and wound care biologics. Leading companies in the advanced wound care market include Smith and Nephew, Acelity (KCI, Systegenix, and LifeCell), MoInlycke, and ConvaTec.  Leading competitors in the wound care market that offer other biologic products such as tissue based products include companies such as MiMedx, Osiris, Organogenesis, Aliqua, Derma Sciences, as well as a significant number of smaller companies.  While we believe that Aurix can compete favorably on the basis of broad application across multiple wound etiologies, we expect that many physicians and allied professionals will continue to employ other treatment approaches and technologies, separately and in combination, in an attempt to treat chronic and hard-to heal wounds.  The chronic wound market has many therapies that compete with Aurix that have established habitual use patterns and provider contracts to encourage standardized use.  Furthermore, other companies have developed or are developing products that could be in direct future competition with our current product line.   We may not be able to compete effectively against such companies in the future. Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger marketing staffs and more experience in commercializing products than we do. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Relating to the Company’s Financial Position, Business and Industry - Our Products Have Existing Competition in the Marketplace.”
 
Raw Materials
 
A reagent used for our Aurix product, bovine thrombin (Thrombin JMI), is available exclusively through Pfizer. Pfizer may unilaterally raise the price for the reagent. If a temporary or permanent interruption in the supply of the reagent were to occur, or the manufacturing costs charged by Pfizer exceed what we can reasonably afford, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.
