Introduction
Umpqua Holdings Corporation, an Oregon corporation, is a bank holding company currently designated as a financial holding company of Umpqua Bank. The Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary, Financial Pacific Leasing, Inc., is a commercial equipment leasing company.
Umpqua Bank is the largest bank with headquarters in the Northwest and is considered one of the most innovative banks in the United States, recognized nationally and internationally for its unique company culture and customer experience strategy. The Bank provides a broad range of banking and other financial services to corporate, institutional, and individual customers.
Business Strategy
Umpqua Bank's primary objective is to become the leading community-oriented financial services organization throughout the Western United States. We intend to increase market share, grow our assets, and increase profitability and total shareholder return by differentiating ourselves from competitors.
On October 12, 2021, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Columbia Banking System, Inc., the parent company of Columbia State Bank, under which the companies will join together in an all-stock combination. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Umpqua shareholders will receive 0.5958 of a share of Columbia stock for each Umpqua share they own. The transaction is expected to close after the close of business on February 28, 2023, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. Upon completion of the Mergers, Umpqua shareholders will own approximately 62% and Columbia shareholders will own approximately 38% of the combined company, and the combined organization will be a leading franchise in the Western United States with more than $50 billion in assets. We believe the combination accelerates our strategic objectives, which are outlined below.
Deliver on Corporate Strategic Objectives. The Company's corporate strategic objectives branded as "Umpqua Next Gen" were designed to modernize the Company, diversify and increase revenue, optimize processes, and improve efficiency. Umpqua Next Gen builds on our customer-centric approach to banking, allowing us to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and create a competitive advantage. The three pillars of Umpqua Next Gen include: Balanced Growth, Human Digital, and Operational Excellence. In late 2020, Umpqua launched "Next Gen 2.0" to build on the success achieved through the original Next Gen plan announced in late 2017, and we expect our pending combination with Columbia to further expand these objectives.
•Through Our Balanced Growth Initiatives, We Focus on Banking Full Customer Relationships. The Company has invested in broader product suites to meet the needs of customers across the spectrum of our business lines. We believe that Umpqua has the products and associate expertise necessary to support current and prospective customers, and we expect our pending combination with Columbia to further enhance these capabilities post-closing. We believe Umpqua can bring the highest value to customers when internal lines of business work collaboratively to serve customers and exceed expectations. Umpqua's value proposition is to combine the product offerings of many larger competitors but deliver with a highly focused, customer-centric approach. The importance of Balanced Growth initiatives has been embedded in modernizing our internal referral and goal-driven incentive plans at Umpqua to reward collaborative behavior and growth across product categories.
•Use A Human Digital Banking Approach to Retain and Expand Customer Base. As customer preferences and behaviors evolve with technological adoption, our strategy remains consistent: deliver an extraordinary experience across all customer touchpoints. As a result, we have developed our Human Digital banking approach, which uses technology to empower deeper, even more meaningful relationships with our customers across all lines of business. We believe this favorably distinguishes Umpqua from its competitors and positions the Company well to adapt quickly as customer use of physical and digital channels evolves. Our innovative strategy remains a differentiator in this Human Digital approach as the combination of digital banking services, through platforms like Umpqua Go-To® and commercial focused applications, enhances our ability to attract a broader range of customers and expand our value proposition across all channels. 
•Become A More Efficient and Effective Company Through Operational Excellence Programs. The objectives of the Operational Excellence programs are to reduce redundancies, simplify processes, and ultimately bring associates closer to the customer. Umpqua redesigned several key processes, including our commercial loan delivery and our deposit origination processes, since the beginning of Umpqua Next Gen. In addition to combining similar functions throughout the Company, we also simplified our supplier and vendor relationships by consolidating spend to key strategic partners.
Establish Strong Brand Awareness. We devote considerable resources to developing the "Umpqua Bank" brand through design strategy, marketing, and delivery through our customer-facing channels, as well as through active public relations, social media, and community-based events and initiatives. Umpqua's goal is to connect with our customers and communities in fresh and engaging ways. The unique look and feel of our stores and interactive displays help demonstrate our commitment to being an innovative, customer-friendly provider of financial products and services, and our active community engagement and investments stand out with commercial customers. Our brand activation approach is based on actions, not just advertising, and builds strong consumer awareness of our products and services.
Prudently Manage Capital. An important part of our strategy is to continue to manage capital prudently and to employ excess capital in a thoughtful and opportunistic manner that improves long-term shareholder returns. We accomplish this through organic growth and a top quartile dividend payout ratio for regional banks. We also pursue combinations with strategic partners, as our pending transaction with Columbia highlights. The combined company will deepen our foothold in the Northwest and California as it creates a leading franchise in the Western United States post-closing. We expect transaction-related synergies to drive growth in loans, deposits, and fee-based products and services as anticipated cost-savings contribute to a more profitable profile that supports capital flexibility at the combined company.
Growth Culture. We believe strongly that by investing in the professional growth of our associates and supporting the economic growth of our communities, we will create more opportunity to provide our products and services and to create deeper customer relationships across bank divisions. Although a successful marketing program will attract customers to visit, well-trained and experienced associates are critical to solving customer needs with the right products and services. 
Products and Services
We offer an array of financial products, delivered through traditional and digital channels, to meet the banking needs of our market area and target customers. To ensure the ongoing viability of our product offerings, we regularly examine the desirability and profitability of existing and potential new products. Our customers can access our products through online banking; mobile banking applications, including our Umpqua Go-To® app; and Umpquabank.com.
Commercial Loans and Leases and Commercial Real Estate Loans. We offer specialized loans for corporate and commercial customers, including accounts receivable and inventory financing, multifamily loans, equipment loans, commercial equipment leases, international trade finance, real estate construction loans and permanent financing, and Small Business Administration program financing as well as capital markets.
Treasury Management. As Umpqua focuses on banking the full customer relationship and meeting the needs of customers of all sizes, we offer treasury management and payments solutions to our customers through our Global Payments & Deposits group. These products include ACH, wires, positive pay, remote deposit capture, integrated payments, integrated receivables, lockbox, cash vault, Real-Time Payments via The Clearinghouse, commercial card, and foreign exchange related products. We also offer merchant services in coordination with a strategic partner, Worldpay.
Deposit Products. We offer deposit products, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, analyzed business accounts, interest bearing checking and savings accounts, money market accounts, insured cash sweep and other investment sweep solutions, and certificates of deposit. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management's desire to increase certain types or maturities of deposit liabilities. Our approach is to provide a streamlined customer experience that meets the customer's needs across all channels. This approach is designed to add value for the customer, increase products per household, and generate related fee income. 
Wealth Management. Through Umpqua's Private Bank, we serve high net worth individuals and families and select non-profits and professional services firms, providing deposit, lending, and financial planning solutions. The Private Bank is designed to expand on Umpqua's existing high-touch customer experience and works collaboratively with other internal departments to offer a comprehensive, integrated approach designed to meet clients' financial needs.
Residential Real Estate Loans. Real estate loans are available for the construction, purchase, and refinancing of residential owner-occupied and rental properties. Borrowers can choose from a variety of fixed and adjustable rate options and terms. We sell many of the residential real estate loans that we originate into the secondary market. Servicing is retained on the majority of these loans.

Consumer Loans. We provide loans to individual borrowers for a variety of purposes, including secured and unsecured personal loans, home equity and personal lines of credit and motor vehicle loans.
Market Area and Competition
The geographic markets we serve are highly competitive for deposits, loans, and leases. We compete with traditional banking institutions, as well as non-bank financial service providers, such as credit unions, mortgage companies, Fintechs and online based financial service providers. In our primary market areas of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada, major national banks generally hold top market share positions. Competition also includes small community banks that operate in a concentrated area within our footprint and other regional banks that focus on commercial and retail banking. In 2021, we expanded our market area by adding loan production offices in Denver, Colorado and Phoenix, Arizona.
As the industry becomes increasingly oriented toward technology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted on mobile devices and computers, non-bank institutions are able to attract customers and provide lending and other financial services even without offices located in our primary service area. Some insurance companies and brokerage firms compete for deposits by offering rates that are higher than the weighted average market price and may be inappropriate for the Bank in relation to its asset and liability management objectives. 
Credit unions present a significant competitive challenge for our banking services and products. As credit unions currently enjoy an exemption from income tax, they are able to offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates than banks can on a comparable basis. Credit unions are also not currently subject to certain regulatory constraints, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, which, among other things, requires us to implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities we serve. Adhering to such regulatory requirements raises the costs associated with our lending activities and reduces potential operating profits. Accordingly, we seek to compete by focusing on building customer relationships, providing superior service, and offering a wide variety of commercial banking products.
The following tables present the Bank's market share percentage for total deposits as of June 30, 2022 in each county where we have operations. The table also indicates the ranking by deposit size in each market. All information in the table was obtained from S&P Global, which compiles deposit data published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as of June 30, 2022 and updates the information for any bank mergers and acquisitions completed subsequent to the reporting date.

Environmental, Social, and Governance
We take pride in being a proactive partner in building stronger, more resilient, and inclusive economies. This approach is embedded in the fabric of our corporate values and culture and drives us to think very intentionally about the communities we serve. In 2022, the organization continued to track our corporate responsibility performance against ESG standards of the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. 
Our annual ESG Report is available on the Impact section of our website but is not incorporated by reference into this document. The report provides additional detail about our evolving ESG work as it relates to the breadth of our stakeholders. The following is a brief overview:
Associates
We create an environment where our associates have the chance to grow, connect and do meaningful work together. Our people are the key to our success. In return, we strive to ensure their work experience allows them to use their skills and passions to make a difference while growing their careers and being recognized and appreciated for their diverse talents, backgrounds and perspectives.
•We aim to foster a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion—not just where we work, but also with our customers and in our communities. 
•We support our associates with a portfolio of programs that address their well-being, from physical and financial health to community connections and workplace recognition.
Customers
We're committed to helping individuals, families and businesses thrive. At Umpqua, banking enables genuine human connection. We see technology as a vital tool to better serve our customers.
•We have prioritized financial health – for our customers and communities – and continue to find ways to provide access to financial information and solutions that matter.
•To better understand our customers and their needs, we surveyed more than 1,200 businesses nationwide to gauge their perspective and plans as the United States transitions into a late-stage pandemic economy. We launched our 2022 Umpqua Bank Business Barometer Report with insights from these small and middle market business leaders throughout the country.
•We continued to invest in community lending efforts to promote access to homeownership for first-time homebuyers through responsible lending practices and education programs.
Communities 
We strive to help level the economic playing field. Our approach to community investment focuses on increasing the economic vitality of our communities—particularly in places where systemic challenges hinder access to financial expertise, gainful employment, and building intergenerational wealth. 
•In 2022, we agreed upon an $8.1 billion Community Benefits Plan with the National Community Reinvestment Coalition and Columbia Bank that builds on our commitment to advance economic opportunity for individuals and support small business formation in historically underserved communities throughout the combined bank’s footprint.
•Umpqua Bank's Connect Volunteer Network™ continues to be one of the nation's leading volunteer programs, providing all associates with up to 40 hours of paid time-off each year committed to a wide range of community needs. 
•Through the Umpqua Bank Charitable Foundation, we are committed to providing grant funding to the counties in which we have a physical banking presence. We support our associates by offering a matching program that doubles their gifts, including an increased giving match in support of organizations aligned with Umpqua Bank's Associate Resource Groups. We contributed funds for capacity building support to Local Initiatives Support Corporation in an effort to expand homeownership for communities of color on the West Coast.
•Umpqua has the operational capacity to meet the needs of Individual Development Accounts providers and savers, enabling low-income families to save towards a targeted goal and purpose.
Planet
We focus on smart business operations that benefit both the environment and the company. As a financial institution, Umpqua acknowledges the economic, societal, and ecological impacts of climate change to our business and to our customers. It's our responsibility to advance smart, responsible practices that lessen our impact and contribute to the company's business goals. By taking steps to shrink the size of our operating footprint—minimizing the resources we consume and the waste we create—we can help both our communities and our bottom line. 
•Umpqua's steps to align operational processes with our commitment to reduce our impact on the environment is stronger than ever.

Human Capital
At Umpqua, we are inspired by a shared purpose – to build economic vitality together for the greater good. We bring together the power of the collective talents, skills and expertise of our dedicated associates to realize our purpose, and to deliver on our commitment to our customers and our communities. We believe in helping businesses and families thrive, and equally, in helping our associates thrive.
The ability to attract, retain, develop, and engage a talented and diverse workforce is critical to executing our business strategy. We strive to deliver an employment experience anchored in a healthy and vibrant culture that appreciates and respects all associates. Our culture is anchored in our values: Customer-obsessed, Caring, Inspired to Learn, Results-oriented, Ethical, and Entrepreneurial.
Demographics. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,500 employees, the majority of which were full-time associates. Our workforce is comprised of customer-facing associates across our various business lines, including our retail stores, our commercial business units, and our home lending business, as well as professionals in various support functions that enable the business, such as technology, finance, risk, audit, and human resources. Our teams are primarily in five western states.
Our workforce decreased by 5% during 2022, which was driven primarily by natural attrition, and a shift in our home lending business strategy. Turnover rate, as calculated in our payroll system, in 2022 was 28%.
Employee Health and Well-being. 
We have embraced a go-forward hybrid work model for many functions and roles, where associates work remotely some days and on-site on others. This model is supported by technology teaming solutions and allows our associates to have the flexibility to work remotely while also enjoying the benefits of in-person collaboration on a regular basis.
We offer competitive medical, dental, vision, life, short and long-term disability, and accident insurance, in addition to paid time off for vacation, sick time, and volunteerism. These programs are available to associates working 20 hours per week or more and are assessed regularly against market benchmarks.
Compensation. We attract and reward our associates by providing market competitive compensation and benefit practices. Our compensation approach is designed to pay for performance and reward associate contributions. Each position has an established compensation range and associates have the opportunity to earn at the high end of their respective range for top performance. Our salary structure is informed by market data, and recognizing that the compensation environment is dynamic, we review and adjust our pay ranges regularly. This includes an ongoing practice of analyzing pay equity. In addition, many positions have incentive plans to encourage achievement of various corporate, business unit, and individual goals.
On a regular basis, we conduct an associate engagement survey to gain insights into associate sentiment about various aspects of the associate experience. This feedback is used to assess the effectiveness of our people practices and prioritize enhancements to our programs.
Talent Development. We believe in the growth of our associates as individuals and as professionals. Our talent development programs provide our associates with the skills and experiences that allow them to thrive, supporting achievement of their personal career goals. We provide a best-in-class online learning catalog that is on-demand for all associates, in addition to role specific training for many roles. Our leadership development programs build key leadership capabilities, and support development of our internal leadership talent pipeline. We have available new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, banking school participation, coaching and mentoring programs. Additionally, we have a robust annual talent review and succession planning program that that is key to our overall talent management practice. This results in targeted development approaches, identification of emerging talent, and a healthy succession talent bench.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Umpqua Bank is committed to ensuring a culture of inclusion – where differences are respected, appreciated, and embraced. We strive to build teams that reflect the diversity of the clients and communities we serve. We have in place a multi-year comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion strategic plan, and continue to execute on key priorities within the plan. Additionally, we have continued to expand programs that support an inclusive work environment, such as our Associate Resource Groups, which are open to all associates. We currently have five resource groups: Pride, Women, Military, BIPOC, and People with Disabilities. Our Diversity Council is comprised of individuals from across the organization, who advance our diversity and inclusion initiatives.
An illustration of our commitment at the most senior level is in the diverse make-up of our eleven-member Board—chaired by a woman and including four women and three people of color.

These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. 
Holding Company Regulation. We are a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company under the GLB Act, and we are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a bank holding company, we are examined by and file reports with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
Financial holding companies are bank holding companies that satisfy certain criteria and are permitted to engage in activities that traditional bank holding companies are not. The qualifications and permitted activities of financial holdings companies are described below under "Regulation of the Financial Services Industry." 
Federal and State Bank Regulation. Umpqua Bank, as an Oregon state-chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, is primarily subject to the supervision and regulation of the DCBS, the FDIC, and the CFPB. In addition, we are subject to regulation by the financial institution oversight authorities in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, and Washington. Our primary state regulator regularly examines the Bank or participates in joint examinations with the FDIC; these agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. 
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. The Bank has a responsibility under the CRA, as implemented by FDIC regulations, to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The FDIC assesses Umpqua Bank's record of compliance with the CRA through periodic examinations. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing CRA. As of the most recent CRA examination, the Bank's CRA rating was "Satisfactory". 
In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. Umpqua Bank's failure to comply with these statutes could result in enforcement actions. 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Banks are subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions. 
The Federal Reserve Act and related Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of Umpqua or its subsidiaries. Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies. Umpqua has adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and has entered into various affiliate agreements designed to comply with Regulation W.
Privacy. Federal and state laws designed to protect individual privacy limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated companies and non-affiliated third parties, and impose other obligations on personal information collected by us. These rules require disclosure of privacy policies to clients and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of opt-out or opt-in authorizations. Pursuant to the GLB Act and certain state laws, companies are required to notify clients of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their personal information. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. 
States are also increasingly proposing or enacting legislation that relates to data privacy and data protection such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act. We expect this trend of state-level activity in these areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located.
Federal Deposit Insurance. Substantially all deposits with Umpqua Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per qualified account.
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by, or pursuant to, any written agreement with the FDIC. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Dividends. Under the Oregon Bank Act and FDICIA, the Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of cash dividends to its parent company and may be required to receive prior approval in certain circumstances. In addition, state and federal regulatory authorities are authorized to prohibit banks and holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. 
The Bank currently has an accumulated deficit and is required to seek FDIC and DCBS approval for quarterly dividends from Umpqua Bank to the Company.
Capital Adequacy. The federal and state bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in their examination and regulation of holding companies and banks. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, a holding company or a bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities. 
The FDIC and Federal Reserve have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for holding companies and banks. The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among holding companies and banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weightings. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. The capital adequacy guidelines limit the degree to which a holding company or bank may leverage its equity capital. 
The Company and the Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve. The Basel III final rules, among other things, (i) implemented increased capital levels for the Company and the Bank, (ii) introduced a new capital measure called CET1 and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk‑weighted assets, (iii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iv) mandated that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (v) expanded the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under Basel III, for most banking organizations the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non‑cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for credit losses, in each case, subject to Basel III specific requirements.
Pursuant to Basel III, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:
•4.5% CET1 to risk‑weighted assets;
•6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk‑weighted assets;
•8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk‑weighted assets; and
•4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on regulatory financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).
Basel III also introduced a new “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk‑weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. 
Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk‑weighted assets, Tier 1 to risk‑weighted assets or total capital to risk‑weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income). 
The Company and the Bank are required to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk‑weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk‑weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) total capital to risk‑weighted assets of at least 10.5%.
Basel III provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non‑consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.
Basel III provides a standardized approach for risk weightings that, depending on the nature of the assets, generally range from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 1,250% for certain trading securitization exposures, resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes than previous regulations.
Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, the Company and the Bank have made a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company's securities portfolio. 
Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement actions. An institution's failure to exceed the capital conservation buffer with common equity Tier 1 capital would result in limitations on an institution's ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. FDICIA requires federal banking regulators to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to a capital-deficient institution, including requiring a capital restoration plan and restricting certain growth activities of the institution. Umpqua could be required to guarantee any such capital restoration plan required of the Bank if the Bank became undercapitalized. Pursuant to FDICIA, regulations were adopted defining five capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, severely undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the regulations, the Bank is considered "well capitalized" as of December 31, 2022. 
The OCC, the FRB, and the FDIC issued a final rule intended to simplify aspects of the regulatory capital rules for banking organizations, such as Umpqua, that are not advanced approaches banking organizations. These rules became effective for the Company on April 1, 2020 and provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital.
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. The standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV.” Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as home equity lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards were effective on January 1, 2023, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2028. In July 2020, the Basel Committee finalized further revisions to the framework for credit valuation adjustment risk, which are intended to align that framework with the market risk framework. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approach institutions. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and the Bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.
Effects of Government Monetary Policy. Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits. These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty. 
Regulation of the Financial Services Industry. Federal laws and regulations governing banking and financial services underwent significant changes in recent years and we believe will continue to undergo significant changes in the future. From time to time, legislation is introduced in the United States Congress that contains proposals for altering the structure, regulation, and competitive relationships of financial institutions. If enacted into law, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, and other financial institutions. Whether or in what form any such legislation may be adopted or the extent to which our business might be affected thereby cannot be predicted. 
The GLB Act defines a form of holding company, known as a financial holding company, that is permitted to acquire subsidiaries that are engaged in banking, securities underwriting and dealing, and insurance underwriting. To qualify as a financial holding company, the bank holding company must be deemed to be well-capitalized and well-managed, as defined by the Federal Reserve. In addition, each subsidiary bank of a bank holding company must also be well-capitalized and well-managed and be rated at least "satisfactory" under the CRA. A bank holding company that does not qualify, or has not chosen, to become a financial holding company must limit its activities to traditional banking activities and those non-banking activities the Federal Reserve has deemed to be permissible because they are closely related to the business of banking. 
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 permits interstate banking and branching, which allows banks to expand nationwide through acquisition, consolidation or merger. Under this law, an adequately capitalized bank holding company may acquire banks in any state or merge banks across state lines if permitted by state law. Further, banks may establish and operate branches in any state subject to the restrictions of applicable state law. Under Oregon law, an out-of-state bank or bank holding company may merge with or acquire an Oregon state chartered bank or bank holding company upon receipt of approval from the Director of the DCBS. The Bank has the ability to open additional de novo branches in the states of Oregon, California, Washington, Idaho, and Nevada. 
Anti-Terrorism Legislation. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks, as well as imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening and holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals. Banks are also required to have effective compliance processes in place relating to anti-money laundering compliance, as well as compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.
The Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act was a sweeping overhaul of financial industry regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council and permanently raised the FDIC deposit insurance coverage to $250,000. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act added additional requirements on Banks and their regulators, including additional interchange fee limits, mortgage limit requirements, and say-on-pay executive compensation requirements.
The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Act, and removed many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by national and state-chartered banks. The FDIC and the OCC have authority to approve applications by insured state non-member banks and national banks, respectively, to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank's home state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit establishment of the branch, if the bank were a state bank chartered by such State. 
Stress Testing and Capital Planning.  Initially, Umpqua was subject to annual Dodd-Frank Act capital stress testing requirements of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.  As part of the DFAST process, Umpqua was required to submit the results of the company-run stress tests to the FDIC, and Umpqua disclosed certain results from stress testing exercises.  However, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, modified provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act allows Umpqua to internally monitor and stress test its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of its regulators.
CFPB Regulation and Supervision. The CFPB has authority to examine Umpqua for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to credit card, deposit, mortgage and other consumer financial products and services the Bank offers. The CFPB is authorized to issue regulations and take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The agency also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. In addition, the CFPB's regulations require lenders to conduct a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation of a residential mortgage loan that the borrower will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan. 
In December 2021, the CFPB published a report providing data on banks' overdraft and non-sufficient funds fee revenues as well as observations regarding consumer protection issues relating to participation in such programs. The CFPB has indicated that it intends to pursue enforcement actions against banking organizations, and their executives, that oversee overdraft practices that are deemed to be unlawful. 
Incentive Compensation. In 2010, federal banking regulators issued final joint agency guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies. This guidance applies to executive and non-executive incentive plans administered by the Bank. The guidance notes that incentive compensation programs must (i) provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward, (ii) be compatible with effective controls and risk management and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including oversight by the Board. The FDIC reviews, as part of its regular examination process, the Bank’s incentive compensation programs.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets, such as the Company and the Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure of incentive based compensation arrangements to regulators.
The proposed general qualitative requirements include (i) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv) requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (v) mandating appropriate record-keeping.
In 2022, the SEC adopted final rules that require disclosure of the relationship between the actual compensation paid to executives and financial performance. 
The Federal Reserve reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of the Company and other banking organizations. The findings of the supervisory initiatives are included in reports of examination and any deficiencies will be incorporated into the Company's supervisory ratings, which can affect the Company's ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. 
Additional legislative and regulatory action may be proposed and could include requirements that could significantly impact our business practices. The impact of these legislative and regulatory initiatives on us, the economy, and the U.S. consumer will depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified.
