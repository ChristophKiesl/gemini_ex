ITEM 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, acquisition, development and commercialization of proprietary drug therapeutics for addressing significant unmet medical needs in the U.S., Europe and additional international markets. Our primary therapeutic focus is the disease intersection of hypertension, arthritis, pain, and oncology allowing for innovative combination therapies of the plethora of already approved drugs and the proprietary novel oligotherapeutics of Marina Biotech, Inc. (“Marina”). Our approach is meant to reduce the risk associated with developing a new drug de novo and also accelerate time to market by shortening the clinical development program through leveraging what is already known or can be learned in our proprietary Patient Level Database (PLD).
 
We currently have three clinical development programs underway: (i) our next generation celecoxib program drug candidates IT-102 and IT-103, each of which is a fixed dose combination (“FDC”) of celecoxib and either lisinopril (IT-102) or olmesartan (IT-103), (ii) CEQ508, an oral delivery of small interfering RNA (“siRNA”) against beta-catenin, combined with IT-102 to suppress polyps in the precancerous syndrome and orphan indication of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (a precancerous syndrome) (“FAP”); and (iii) CEQ508 combined with IT-103 to treat Colorectal Cancer (“CRC”).
 
Our preclinical pipeline also includes potentially the best in class oligotherapeutics for bladder cancer, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (“IBD”), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”). Preclinical proof of concept studies have been completed with respect to bladder cancer and IBD.
 
Although we intend to retain ownership and control of product candidates by advancing their development, we will also consider partnerships with pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies in order to reduce time to market and to balance the risks associated with drug discovery and development, thereby maximizing our stockholders’ value. Our partnering objectives include generating revenue through license fees, milestone-related development fees and royalties by licensing rights to our product candidates, which would be a source of non-dilutive capital.
 
We may engage in licensing activities associated with our delivery platforms (SMARTICLES and tkRNAi). However, since our strategy is to be a late-stage biopharmaceutical company with the goal of a commercial product launch and profitability within the next several years, the development and licensing of these platforms for the therapeutic assets of third parties will not be the primary focus of our company.
 
Background 
 
As further described below under “Merger with IThenaPharma”, on November 15, 2016, Marina entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with IThenaPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“IThena” or “IThenaPharma”), IThena Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of IThena (“Merger Sub”), and Vuong Trieu, Ph.D. as the IThena Representative (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into IThena, with IThena surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Marina (such transaction, the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, the former holders of IThena common stock immediately prior to the completion of the Merger owned approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of Marina common stock immediately following the completion of the Merger.
 
Marina was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name Nastech Pharmaceutical Company on September 23, 1983, and IThena was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 3, 2014. IThena is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger, and thus the historical financial statements of IThena will be treated as the historical financial statements of our company and will be reflected in our quarterly and annual reports for periods ending after the effective time of the Merger. Accordingly, beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we will report the results of IThena and Marina and their respective subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
 
Prior to the Merger, Marina’s pipeline consisted of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. That pipeline included CEQ508, a product in clinical development for the treatment of FAP, for which Marina received both Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) and Fast Track Designation (“FTD”) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), as well as preclinical programs for the treatment of type 1 myotonic dystrophy (“DM1”) and DMD. The IThena pipeline of celecoxib FDCs is now incorporated into the combined company. We currently plan to develop IT-102/IT-103 – next generation celecoxib – together with CEQ508, as a therapeutic enhancer for therapies against FAP and CRC. We are also developing IT-102/IT-103 for the treatment of combined arthritis / hypertension and the treatment of pain requiring a high dose of celecoxib.

Prior to the completion of the Merger, Marina acquired/in-licensed and further developed nucleic acid chemistry and delivery-related technologies in order to establish a novel and differentiated drug discovery platform. We believe that this platform, which we now control, allows us to distinguish ourselves from others in the nucleic acid therapeutics area in that we are the only company capable of creating a wide variety of therapeutics targeting coding and non-coding RNA via multiple mechanisms of action such as RNA interference (“RNAi”), messenger RNA translational inhibition, exon skipping, microRNA (“miRNA”) replacement, miRNA inhibition, and steric blocking in order to modulate gene expression either up or down depending on the specific mechanism of action.
 
The breadth of our discovery platform allows us to offer to our partners the most appropriate nucleic acid-based therapeutic approach necessary to effectively modulate targets for a specific disease indication, many of which are considered undruggable by traditional methodologies. Each approach, i.e. siRNA, miRNA or single-strand oligonucleotide, has its advantages and disadvantages, and we can screen across multiple mechanisms of action to identify the most effective therapeutic. Our licensees, namely ProNAi Therapeutics, Inc. (“ProNAi”), Mirna Therapeutics, Inc. (“Mirna”) and MiNA Therapeutics, Ltd. (“MiNA”), are focused on oncology and have clinical programs in recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and unresectable primary liver cancer or solid cancers with liver involvement.
 
We believe that we possess a unique industry-leading nucleic acid-based drug discovery platform, which is protected by a strong intellectual property (“IP”) position and validated through: (1) licensing agreements for our SMARTICLES delivery technology with Mirna, ProNAi and MiNA for unique nucleic acid payloads – microRNA mimics, DNA interference oligonucleotides and small-activating RNA, respectively; (2) Mirna and ProNAi’s respective clinical experience with SMARTICLES; (3) a licensing agreement with Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc. (“Novartis”) for our CRN technology; (4) a licensing agreement with Protiva Biotherapeutics, Inc. (“Arbutus”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (formerly Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation), for our Unlocked Nucleobase Analog (“UNA”) technology; (5) licensing agreements with two large international companies (i.e., Novartis and Monsanto company (“Monsanto”)) for certain chemistry and delivery technologies; and (6) the FAP phase 1b/2a clinical trial with our TransKingdom RNA™ interference (“tkRNAi”) platform.
 
Following the Merger, we have reorganized the acquired Marina platform into a strong pipeline of preclinical and clinical drug candidates, which we believe will unlock their value. An example is the recent validation of the tkRNAi beta-catenin program against FAP following completion of our statistical analysis of our phase I data showing the achievement of statistical significant proof of concept knockdown of beta-catenin without side effects. This tkRNAi platform is now being developed further for IBD and other disease indications, as well as therapeutic microbiome.
 
Recent Developments
 
Merger with IThenaPharma
 
On November 15, 2016, Marina entered into the Merger Agreement with IThenaPharma, Merger Sub and Vuong Trieu, as the IThena representative, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into IThenaPharma, with IThenaPharma surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Marina.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, without any action on the part of any shareholder, each issued and outstanding share of IThenaPharma’s common stock, other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to the Merger Agreement, was converted into the right to receive 10.510708 shares of Marina common stock (the “Exchange Ratio”). IThenaPharma shareholders were not entitled to receive fractional shares in the Merger. Instead, a holder of IThenaPharma’s common stock that would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Marina common stock in the Merger received one full additional share of Marina common stock.
 
In addition, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding IThenaPharma warrant was assumed by Marina and converted into a warrant representing the right to purchase shares of Marina common stock, with the number of shares underlying such warrant and the exercise price thereof being adjusted by the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lowest number of whole shares.
 
As a result of the Merger, the former holders of IThenaPharma common stock immediately prior to the completion of the Merger owned approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of Marina common stock immediately following the completion of the Merger.

Autotelic LLC License Agreement
 
In connection with the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, on November 15, 2016, Marina entered into a License Agreement with Autotelic LLC, a stockholder of IThenaPharma that became the holder of 23,123,558 shares of Marina common stock as a result of the Merger, and an entity of which Dr. Trieu, the Chairman of our Board of Directors (the “Board) serves as Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which (A) Marina licensed to Autotelic LLC certain patent rights, data and know-how relating to FAP and nasal insulin, for human therapeutics other than for oncology-related therapies and indications, and (B) Autotelic LLC licensed to Marina certain patent rights, data and know-how relating to IT-102 and IT-103, in connection with individualized therapy for pain using a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and an anti-hypertensive without inducing intolerable edema, and treatment of certain aspects of proliferative disease, but not including rights to IT-102/IT-103 for TDM guided dosing for all indications using an Autotelic Inc.TDM Device. Marina also granted a right of first refusal to Autotelic LLC with respect to any license by Marina of the rights licensed by or to Marina under the License Agreement in any cancer indication outside of gastrointestinal cancers.


The License Agreement shall immediately terminate, all rights granted by a licensor under the License Agreement shall immediately revert forthwith to the applicable licensor, all benefits which have accrued under the License Agreement shall automatically be transferred to the applicable licensor, and all rights, title and interest in the licensed intellectual property shall immediately revert back to the applicable licensor if: (i) the applicable licensee makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors prior to the two (2) year anniversary of the date of the License Agreement; (ii) the applicable licensee applies for or consents to the appointment of a receiver, a custodian, a trustee or liquidator of all or a substantial part of its intellectual property prior to the two (2) year anniversary of the date of the License Agreement; (iii) prior to the two (2) year anniversary of the date of the License Agreement, and without the consent of the applicable licensor, the applicable licensee effects a Change of Control Transaction (as defined in the License Agreement); (iv) the applicable licensee ceases operations; or (v) the applicable licensee fails to take any material steps, as reasonably determined by the applicable licensor, to develop the licensed intellectual property prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the date of the License Agreement (each of the foregoing items (i) through (v), a “Termination Event”). Upon the occurrence of any Termination Event, the applicable licensee shall immediately discontinue all use of the licensed intellectual property.
 
Master Services Agreement
 
In connection with the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, on November 15, 2016, Marina entered into a Master Services Agreement with Autotelic Inc., a stockholder of IThenaPharma that became the holder of 5,255,354 shares of Marina common stock as a result of the Merger, and an entity of which Dr. Trieu serves as Chairman of the Board, pursuant to which Autotelic Inc. agreed to provide certain business functions and services from time to time during regular business hours at Marina’s request (the “Master Services Agreement”). The Master Services Agreement has a term of ten years, though either party can terminate it by giving to the other party ninety (90) days’ prior written notice of such termination (provided that the final day of the term shall be on the last day of the calendar month in which the noticed termination date falls). The resources available to us through Autotelic Inc. include, without limitation, regulatory, clinical, preclinical, manufacturing, formulation, legal, accounting and information technology (“IT”).
 
As partial consideration for the services to be performed by Autotelic Inc. under the Master Services Agreement, during the period prior to the date on which we have completed an equity offering of either common or preferred stock in which the gross proceeds therefrom is no less than $10 million, we shall issue to Autotelic Inc. warrants to purchase shares of our common stock (the “MSA Warrants”), with the number of shares of common stock for which such MSA Warrants are exercisable, and the exercise price for such MSA Warrants, being based on the closing price of our common stock; provided, that in no event shall such price be lower than the lower of (x) $0.28 per share or (y) the lowest exercise price of any warrants that have been issued by us in a capital raising transaction (and that would otherwise reduce the exercise price of any other outstanding warrants issued by us) during the period beginning on November 15, 2016 and ending on the date of the issuance of the MSA Warrants.
 
Line Letter
 
In connection with the Merger, Marina entered into a Line Letter dated November 15, 2016 with Dr. Trieu, our Chairman of the Board, for an unsecured line of credit in an amount not to exceed $540,000, to be used for current operating expenses. Dr. Trieu will consider requests for advances under the Line Letter until April 30, 2017. Dr. Trieu shall have the right at any time for any reason in his sole and absolute discretion to terminate the line of credit available under the Line Letter or to reduce the maximum amount available thereunder without notice; provided, that Dr. Trieu agreed that he shall not demand the repayment of any advances that are made under the Line Letter prior to the earlier of: (i) May 15, 2017; and (ii) the date on which (x) we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors, (y) we apply for or consents to the appointment of a receiver, a custodian, a trustee or liquidator of all or a substantial part of our assets or (z) we cease operations. Dr. Trieu has advanced an aggregate of $250,000 under the Line Letter. Advances made under the Line Letter shall bear interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum, shall be evidenced by the Demand Promissory Note issued to Dr. Trieu, and shall be due and payable upon demand by Dr. Trieu.

Dr. Trieu shall have the right, exercisable by delivery of written notice thereof (the “Election Notice”), to either: (i) receive repayment for the entire unpaid principal amount advanced under the Line Letter and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon on the date of the delivery of the Election Notice (the “Outstanding Balance”) or (ii) convert the Outstanding Balance into such number of shares of our common stock as is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Outstanding Balance by (y) $0.10 (such price, the “Conversion Price”, and the number of shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to the foregoing formula, the “Conversion Shares”); provided, that in no event shall the Conversion Price be lower than the lower of (x) $0.28 per share or (y) the lowest exercise price of any securities that have been issued by us in a capital raising transaction (and that would otherwise reduce the exercise price of any other outstanding warrants issued by us) during the period between November 15, 2016 and the date of the delivery of the Election Notice.
 
We look for continued support beyond the current Line Letter from Dr. Trieu, who has expressed strong interest in the success of our programs and is working diligently to help move our assets through regulatory/clinical development into sales/marketing.
 
Appointment/Resignation of Directors; Appointment of Officers
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in connection with the Merger, Dr. Trieu was appointed to the Board, to serve until our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. In connection with his appointment as a member of the Board, Dr. Trieu was also appointed to serve as Chairman of the Board.
 
On December 8, 2016, the Board elected Philippe P. Calais, Ph.D. Pharm. as a member of the Board to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Joseph W. Ramelli as a director, such election to be effective January 1, 2017.
 
On December 8, 2016, the Board appointed Mr. Ramelli, who had served as our interim Chief Executive Officer, to serve as our Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. At the same time, Mr. Ramelli resigned as a member of the Board effective immediately.
 
On February 10, 2017, the Board approved the appointment of Larn Hwang, Ph.D. to serve as our Chief Scientific Officer, and Mihir Munsif to serve as our Chief Operating Officer, in each case, effective February 13, 2017. Dr. Hwang will lead the further development of Marina’s therapeutic pipeline and Mr. Munsif will lead the manufacturing of our drug products on commercial scale.
 
On February 21, 2017, we appointed Seymour Fein MD as our Chief Medical Officer. Having taken more than twenty drugs from development on through FDA approval, Dr. Fein is in a unique position to lead the regulatory and clinical development of our pipeline.
 
Arrangements with LipoMedics
 
On February 6, 2017, we entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with LipoMedics, Inc. (“LipoMedics”) pursuant to which, among other things, we provided to LipoMedics a license to our SMARTICLES platform for the delivery of nanoparticles including small molecules, peptides, proteins and biologics. This represents the first time that our SMARTICLES technologies have been licensed in connection with nanoparticles delivering small molecules, peptides, proteins and biologics. On the same date, we also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with LipoMedics pursuant to which we issued to LipoMedics an aggregate of 862,068 shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $250,000.
 
Under the terms of the License Agreement, we could receive up to $90 million in success-based milestones. In addition, if LipoMedics determines to pursue further development and commercialization of products under the License Agreement, LipoMedics agreed, in connection therewith, to purchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $500,000, with the purchase price for each share of common stock being the greater of $0.29 or the volume weighted average price of our common stock for the thirty (30) trading days immediately preceding the date on which LipoMedics notifies us that it intends to pursue further development or commercialization of a licensed product.
 
If LipoMedics breaches the License Agreement, we shall have the right to terminate the License Agreement effective sixty (60) days following delivery of written notice to LipoMedics specifying the breach, if LipoMedics fails to cure such material breach within such sixty (60) day period; provided, that if LipoMedics advises us in writing within such sixty (60) day period that such breach cannot reasonably be cured within such period, and if in our reasonable judgment, LipoMedics is diligently seeking to cure such breach during such period, then such period shall be extended an additional sixty (60) days for an aggregate of 120 days after written notice of termination, and if LipoMedics fails to cure such material breach by the end of such 120-day period, the License Agreement shall terminate in its entirety. LipoMedics may terminate the License Agreement by giving thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to us.

Vuong Trieu, Ph.D., the Chairman of our Board of Directors, is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Operating Officer of LipoMedics. Lipomedics is a leader in nanomedicine in the field of oncology and its pipeline includes phospholipid paclitaxel nanoparticles and others. These products are potentially billion dollar products and we are looking forward to continued interaction with Lipomedics to accelerate its development program and expand the SMARTICLES delivery platform.
 
Issuance of Shares to Service Providers
 
In February 2017, we entered into two privately negotiated transactions pursuant to which we committed to issue an aggregate of 6,153,684 shares of our common stock for an effective price per share of $0.29 to settle aggregate liability of approximately $948,000, which is reflected in accrued expenses as of December 31, 2016. In addition, in February 2017, we issued 0.3 million shares of our common stock to a consultant providing investment advisory services.
 
Issuance of Shares to Novosom
 
On November 15, 2016, Marina agreed to issue to Novosom Verwaltungs GmbH (“Novosom”) 1.5 million shares of common stock upon the closing of the Merger in consideration of Novosom’s agreement that the consummation of the Merger would not constitute a “Liquidity Event” under that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of July 27, 2010 between and among Marina, Novosom and Steffen Panzner, Ph.D., and thus that no additional consideration under such agreement would be due to Novosom as a result of the consummation of the Merger.
 
Liquidity
 
We have sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations. At December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $2 million, negative working capital of approximately $2.7 million, and $105,347 in cash. We have been funded through a combination of licensing payments and debt and equity offerings.
 
We believe that our current cash resources, including the remaining balance available to us under the Line Letter, will enable us to fund our intended operations through the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2017. Our ability to execute our operating plan beyond such date depends on our ability to obtain additional funding.
 
The volatility in our stock price, as well as market conditions in general, could make it difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional capital when required, we may have to modify, delay or abandon some or all of our planned activities, or terminate our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such endeavors. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


Our Strategy 
 
Our mission is to improve the lives of patients and assist their caretakers by delivering novel therapies that improve outcomes while reducing the undesirable side effects of many current therapies. We intend to pursue this initially through the development, approval, launch and marketing of IT-102 and IT-103. We believe we have assembled a strong team with in-depth domain knowledge in drug development and commercialization. The key elements to our long-term business strategy are described below:

1) | IT-102 and IT-103 as our next generation celecoxib for management of arthritis pain. IT-102 targets a population requiring angiotensin converting enzyme (“ACE”) inhibitors such as lisinopril and IT-103 targets a population requiring olmesartan. The initial approval based on pivotal bioequivalence (“BE”) trial and a small phase III trial will be for combined arthritis pain and hypertension for patients already taking both drugs. Exploiting the suppression of celecoxib induced edema, we anticipate that these FDCs can eventually replace all of celecoxib prescriptions with or without hypertension once our phase III trial is completed with positive demonstration of edema suppression. This trial will be conducted post approval for label change and will target the highest edema risk patients- the elderly patients whose pill burden is greater than five per day. The inherent lower risk of gastrointestinal (“GI”) bleeding with celecoxib makes it likely that IT-102 and IT-103 can also capture market shares of other pain medications such as ibuprofen and indomethacin.

2) | M101 as beta-catenin short-hairpin RNA (“shRNA”) combination against FAP. This is a combination of IT-102 and CEQ508 (tkRNAi beta-catenin shRNA). Celecoxib was originally approved for FAP, however, it was removed from the market due to fear of cardiovascular risks during the VIOXX withdrawal. But with the PRECISION trial showing that celecoxib is as safe as ibuprofen and naproxen, we anticipate more acceptance of celecoxib. Furthermore, having lisinopril on board to control edema and hypertension, we anticipate that high doses of celecoxib would be safe and effective against FAP. Additionally, the systemic suppression of COX-2 directly and beta-catenin indirectly with celecoxib will be augmented by targeted and local suppression of beta-catenin by beta-catenin shRNA (CEQ508). Together we anticipate a synergistic, safe and effective suppression of polyps in FAP. Since we have completed the phase I proof of concept study for CEQ508, we will move forward to registration phase III trial once we have FDA acceptance of Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”). 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) | M102 as beta-catenin shRNA combination against CRC. This is a combination of IT-103 and CEQ508 (tkRNAi beta-catenin shRNA). Olmesartan has been shown to improve overall survival (“OS”) among various cancer types, the combination of systemic suppression of ARB/COX-2/Catenin by IT-103 augmented by targeted and local suppression of beta-catenin by CEQ508 is expected to significantly improve the outcome for CRC patients. Additionally, the potential of using CEQ508 to manipulate the microbiome such that it is therapeutic will be investigated. We have termed this “therapeutic microbiome”. 
4) | M300 series as IL-6Ra/ Claudin-2/ MIP3a as specific tkRNA/shRNAs against IBD. We evaluated live attenuated bacterial delivery of shRNAs against selected IBD gene targets to achieve specificity, efficacy, and safety. The in vitro efficacy was assessed by an invasion assay using the CMT-93 mouse colon epithelial cells (or RAW264.7 macrophages for TNF-a) and qRT-PCR measurement of mRNA reduction vs. b-actin control. Three gene targets (IL-6Ra, Claudin-2, and MIP3a) and two tkRNAi delivery strains were tested in vivo using an oxazolone or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) acute murine colitis model. Oral delivery of IL-6Ra tkRNAi strains (CEQ608 and CEQ609) led to a significant reduction in colon length and abolished IL-6Rα message in proximal ileum in DSS exposed groups. Claudin-2 strains (CEQ621 and CEQ626) caused a significant reduction in Claudin-2 mRNA expression and protein levels in the colon as well as attenuation of the disease phenotype and enhanced survival. Treatment with MIP3a therapeutic strains CEQ631 and CEQ632 also resulted in a significant reduction in sum pathology scores and reduction in MIP3a mRNA expression. These findings suggest that tkRNAi-mediated gene silencing of pro-inflammatory targets represents a potential therapeutic development avenue for IBD therapy. 
5) | M400 series as surviving/PLK1 as specific DiLA2 (Di-Alkylated Amino Acid)/siRNA against bladder cancer. This program was originally licensed to Debiopharm. A range of RNAi triggers against the cancer-related genes polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and survivin were able to knockdown efficacies with IC50 values in the 10 to 30 pM range in cell based assays. This triggered widespread apoptosis and, in the case of PLK1, a strong reduction in cell viability. The selected siRNAs were formulated into positively charged multilamellar liposomes of around 100nm. Due to the negatively charged proteoglycan-rich urothelium, a formulation with a lipid containing a guanidinium group was deemed particularly promising in being able to penetrate the 6-7 cell-layered urothelium. Accordingly, these formulations, when instilled into the bladder, were able to very efficiently suppress the growth of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers in mouse models of the disease. Highly efficient in vivo knockdowns were found, 90-95% with 1mg/kg dose level. 

Product Candidates
 
We currently have two late stage arthritis pain/hypertension drug candidates, IT-102 and IT-103. IT-102 will commence a BE registration trial for combined arthritis pain/hypertension where ACE is required in the second half of 2017, and ongoing manufacturing of exhibit batches and clinical trial batches as part of the CMC package for the New Drug Application (“NDA”), which is expected in the first half of 2018. Sales and marketing build out to begin during 2018, for a potential launch of the product in the first half of 2019. IT-103 will commence a BE registration trial for combined arthritis pain/hypertension where Angiotensin II receptor blockers (“ARB”) is required in the first half of 2018. The oncology programs targeting beta-catenin against FAP and CRC will progress along their developmental timeline following a meeting with the FDA to obtain concurrence on trial design and endpoints during 2017. Additionally we have programs for IBD and bladder cancer with completed animal proof of concept. These programs will be developed as resources allow. In subsequent sections we will discuss in detail our three leading programs (IT-102, IT-103, and M101).

The potential annual market size of IT-102 and IT-103 was projected to be $170M and $250M, respectively. With the FAP potential market size of $400M, we are projecting the total addressable market for our lead clinical candidates to be ~$820M annually .

IT-102/IT-103
 
IT-102 is a fixed-dose combination formulation of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 selective inhibitor, and lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, indicated in patients for whom treatment with both celecoxib and lisinopril is appropriate. IT-103 is the same as IT-102, except lisinopril was replaced by olmesartan- an Angiotensin II receptor blockers (“ARB”). IT-103 is for patients for whom treatment with both celecoxib and olmesartan is appropriate. These FDCs will allow rapid access to market through a short clinical program. The initial approval based on pivotal BE trial and a small phase III trial will be for combined arthritis pain and hypertension for patients already taking both drugs. Exploiting the suppression of celecoxib induced edema, we anticipate that they can eventually replace all of celecoxib prescriptions with or without hypertension once our phase III trial is completed with positive demonstration of edema suppression. This trial will be conducted post approval for label change and will target the highest edema risk patients- the elderly patients whose pill burden is greater than five per day. The inherent lower risk of GI bleeding with celecoxib can push IT-102 and IT-103 to also capture market shares of other pain medications such as ibuprofen and indomethacin.
 
The rationale for IT-102/IT-103 drug development is based on the coexistence of arthritis pain and hypertension in populations, as well as association of hypertension and edema with celecoxib treatment. Additionally, the preference for and improved compliance with a single tablet makes the proposed FDC formulation a very useful drug for treatment of two common conditions of increasing frequency in the aging population.
 
Arthritis/Hypertension
 
Arthritis and hypertension often coexist due to common risk factors. Firstly, both conditions are age related. The risk of developing osteoarthritis (“OA”) increases from the age of 40 onwards, with 25% of the population over the age of 45 presenting with clinical symptoms (Hunter et al, 2006). It has been reported that approximately 50% of patients with OA suffer from hypertension. Data from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System indicated that the top 2 most prevalent conditions in those over 70 years of age were hypertension (60.7%) and arthritis (55%) (Hunter et al, 2011). The prevalence of hypertension in rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) in most large studies lies between 52% and 73%, with the age ranging from 51 to 66 years (Fernandes et al, 2015).
 
Hypertension is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease in the general population (Yusuf et al, 2004). It affects about 1 billion individuals worldwide (Kearney et al, 2005) and about 30% of the adult population in the United States (Nwankwo et al, 2013). Despite its high prevalence and the impact of its complications, control of hypertension is far from adequate both in the general population (Chobanian et al, 2003; Oliveria et al, 2002; Primatesta et al, 2006; Luepker et al, 2006) and in arthritis patients (Panoulas et al, 2007). The poor control rates in the general population, where only a third of the people with hypertension have their blood pressure under control (Wang et al, 2005), is attributed to poor access to health care and medications, as well as a lack of adherence to long-term therapy for a usually asymptomatic condition. In the general population, anti-hypertensive therapy has been associated with a reduction of 40% in strokes, 20% in myocardial infarction and >50% in heart failure (Neal et al, 2000), which emphasizes the importance of optimal blood pressure control in any population, including arthritis patients.
 
Effective simultaneous control of arthritis and hypertension is greatly facilitated by FDC, as most hypertension patients require multiple medications for effective management. However, adherence to concomitant hypertension therapy decreases as the number of medications increases. As the pill burden increases from 1 to ≥10, patient adherence rapidly decreases from 58.8% to 24.5%, respectively (Resnic et al., 2006). A single FDC tablet results in 20% higher patient adherence than observed with a 2-tablet combination therapy (Dezii et al, 2009). In addition, coupling the treatment for asymptomatic hypertension with painful arthritis will not only improve compliance to the long-term therapy of hypertension, but also reduce the renal adverse events associated with NSAIDs/celecoxib treatment. So far, there is no such FDC available in the US. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a celecoxib/anti-hypertensive FDC such as IT-102.
 
Celecoxib side effects
 
Hypertension and other cardiovascular risks are associated with celecoxib treatment. Clinical trials and observational studies have shown that nonselective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs are associated with increased cardiovascular risks and events (Cheng et al, 2002; Boers et al, 2001; Mukherjee et al, 2001; Solomon et al, 2005). That is why cardiovascular thrombotic events, hypertension, congestive heart failure and edema are listed in the warnings and precautions of the CELEBREXÒ package insert (CELEBREX® Package Insert, 2016). Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials, Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) trial and Prevention of Spontaneous Adenomatous Polyps (PreSAP) trial, showed a nearly 2-fold-increased cardiovascular risk in celecoxib treatment groups compared with the control group. Both dose groups in APC trial, celecoxib at 200 or 400mg twice daily, showed significant systolic blood pressure (SBP) elevations at 1 and 3 years from 2 to 5.2 mmHg; however, no significant elevation of SBP was observed in the 400 mg once daily group in the PreSAP trial (Solomon et al, 2006). This trend for a dose-related increase in cardiovascular events and blood pressure raises the possibility that lower doses or other dose intervals may be associated with less cardiovascular risk.

Celecoxib has been intensively evaluated on its blood pressure effects. A post hoc analysis on the renal safety of celecoxib with data from more than 50 clinical studies involving more than 13,000 subjects showed that celecoxib had no clinically detectable effect on blood pressure (Whelton 2000). In the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS) with more than 8000 OA and RA patients, there were 2.7% of patients in the celecoxib group (400 mg, b.i.d, N=3987) that showed either new-onset or aggravated hypertension (Whelton 2006). A meta-analysis on the adverse events of celecoxib in OA and RA patients, which included data from 39,605 randomized patients in 31 trials, showed that the proportion of any patient having hypertension or aggregated hypertension was only 1-2% with celecoxib and there was no significant difference between celecoxib and placebo group (Moore 2005).
 
The large meta-analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials in patients with OA or RA found that celecoxib was associated with a significantly higher incidence of edema (at any site) than placebo (2.6% vs 1.4%: RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4, 2.7) (Moore et al, 2005). Similarly, a pooled analysis of renal adverse event data from seven 12-week North American trials involving 9,666 patients with OA or RA found that the overall incidence of renal adverse events with celecoxib (4.3%) was greater than that with placebo (2.5%; p<0.05) and was not significantly different from that with NSAIDs (4.1%) (Whelton et al, 2000). The most common renal adverse events with celecoxib were peripheral edema (2.1%), hypertension (0.8%) and aggravated hypertension (0.6%) (Whelton et al, 2000).
 
Proprietary Patient Level Data Analyses
 
We have also compared the edema in patient populations receiving celecoxib alone and celecoxib in combination with a variety of antihypertensives. To support this study a proprietary database was created which contains: 1) Claims data from Symphony pertaining to anti-hypertensives, Statins, COX-2 inhibitors, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDS”). The data span the most recent 36 months and 2) registry data from the ACC reporting blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), peripheral edema flags (yes, no, missing), heart rate, LDL, glucose level, ejection fraction, glomerular filtration rate, height, weight, body mass index, and the like.
 
Symphony dataset is True Patient Level data - All Data Sources be it RX or MX claims is tied back to individual patients which is tracked and then encrypted based on first name, last name, gender, date of birth and zip code to give an accurate picture of patient level informatics year over year regardless of insurance changes. The source of Managed Markets Rx claims data comes from various providers, including Intelligent network services (Switch Data) as well as direct data feeds from pharmacies that do not use Switches so it does not create payer biases.
 
The definition of the Symphony database is as follow: 1) Takes Celebrex, Anti-hypertensive (“AH”), Statin or NSAID or have OA, RA or some other form of arthritis for 36 months, 2) Time Frame of Jan 1, 2012 – Dec 31, 2014 (3 years), 3) Number of files: 201, 4) File Size: 561 GB zipped (~ 2.5 TB), 5) Unique Patients: 162 million, 6) Patients on Celebrex: 4.3 million, 7) Patients that have OA 16.3 million (15.4 million only OA), 8) Patients that have RA :2.3 million (1.4 million only RA).
 
The definition for the ACC registry is as follow: 1) Have 3+ BP readings, 2) Time Frame: Jan 1, 2012 – Dec 31, 2014 (3 years), 3) Number of files: 2, 4) Size: 590 MB, 51 MB, 5) Unique Patients: 1.58 million, 6) Patients with BP readings: 1.58 million, 7) Patients with Edema Flag True:870K.
 
The analysis also showed that there was no impact of celecoxib consumed on the change in blood pressure readings, even at a dose of 400 mg/day (Qazi 2017). Therefore, we confirmed that celecoxib has minimum impact on blood pressure at doses in treatment of arthritis pain. However, the effect of celecoxib on edema is higher than reported in controlled clinical trials. Incidence of edema increased from 20-25% for celecoxib alone to 25-35% when celecoxib was combined with any drug suggestive of drug induced edema. Coadministration with either ACE (i.e. lisinopril) or ARB (i.e. olmesartan) reduced the edema to 10-15%. The edema rate was then measured in the aforementioned database. The incidence of edema was higher for OA patients than RA, other arthritis, or arthritis free patients. The incidence of edema increased when patients were taking Celebrex for all groups except for RA and no arthritis free patients. Overall OA seems to be susceptible to Celebrex induced edema- the frequency of which is higher among patients on the ACC registry which would have prior cardiovascular history.

Manufacturing
 
Formulation work up for IT-102 is completed. The formulation was designed by considering the following characteristics: 1) Single free dose of individual drugs is already marketed in form of hard capsule and tablet, 2) Reference Listed Drug of Celecoxib (Celecoxib®) is hard capsule in High Density Polyethylene (“HDPE”) bottles, 3) Reference Listed Drug of Lisinopril (Zestril®) is uncoated tablet in HDPE bottles. Based on these characteristics, an oral dosage form suitable for administration to the adult was favored. Tablets were preferred to capsules in order to increase the quantity of drug substance available per unit. Celecoxib/Lisinopril FDC tablets are white circular biconvex bi-layered tablets of different size. Consequently, the size and weight increase with dosage strength. Celecoxib/Lisinopril FDC tablet drug products are supplied as 100/2.5 mg, 100/5.0 mg, 100/10.0 mg, 100/20.0 mg, 200/2.5 mg, 200/5.0 mg, 200/10.0 mg, and 200/20.0 mg tablets in HDPE bottles. The constituents were chosen to achieve the following objectives: 1) using of well-known and compatible excipients, which allow a world-wide registration of the product, 2) satisfactory chemical stability of the active substance, 3) satisfactory dissolution rate. The objective was to obtain a mean upper than 75% at 30 minutes with slight variation inter and intra batches, and 4) a quantity of excipients as low as possible to obtain a tablet as small as possible.
 
Pilot scale manufacturing at 10,000 tablets per batch was performed. The dissolution profiles of RLDs and pilot product (200/20 mg FDC bi-layer tablet) were similar with the results of celecoxib and lisinopril. Additionally, the dissolution profiles were considered similar using the similarity factor (f2) following the guidance for industry “Dissolution testing of immediate release solid oral dosage forms”, FDA, CDER, August 1997. With similarity in dissolution we are expecting to have similarity in BE trial.
 
IT-102 manufacturing has been transferred to an FDA inspected current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) contract manufacturing organization and the exhibit batches and the clinical trial materials batches are being manufactured for clinical trial. This would complete the manufacturing portion of the NDA dossier to be submitted to the FDA to support the marketing approval of IT-102. IT-103 is at the beginning of this process.
 
Clinical Study Plan for IT-102 (Celebrex/lisinopril)
 
One BE study is planned to compare and assess the safety and pharmacokinetic characteristics between co-administered 200 mg celecoxib and 20 mg or 2.5 mg lisinopril and IT-102 (200/20 mg or 200/2.5 mg celecoxib/lisinopril) monotherapy in healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 50 years. The study could be completed in six months.

This is going to be a single-dose, cross-over study of 60 subjects divided into two cohorts and treated over four periods. One tablet of IT-102 at the highest dose (FDC tablet of 200 mg celecoxib/20 mg lisinopril) or the lowest dose (FDC tablet of 200 mg celecoxib/2.5 mg lisinopril) will be administered once orally as the test drug. Co-administration once daily of one tablet each of 200 mg celecoxib and 20 mg lisinopril or one tablet each of 200 mg celecoxib and 2.5 mg lisinopril will be used as the comparator for the highest and lowest dose of the FDC, respectively.
 
For comparison of IT-102 with the comparator (co-administration of dose matched celecoxib and lisinopril), the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios for the primary pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC and Cmax) will be used for determination of BE according to the FDA’s criteria. Adverse events (AEs) will also be assessed and compared between IT-102 and the comparator.
 
Phase III Safety and Efficacy Study Plan. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the efficacy and safety of lisinopril in subjects with OA and hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy. One multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, 2-week phase 3 clinical study is planned to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of IT-102. It is planned to recruit 150 to 250 patients with OA and hypertension randomized into four arms, which are IT-102 (200 mg celecoxib/20 mg lisinopril), celecoxib (200 mg), lisinopril (20 mg) and placebo. The primary endpoint is demonstration that the reduction in blood pressure by IT-102 (200 mg celecoxib/20 mg lisinopril) is at least 50% of the reduction by lisinopril (20 mg) alone in the patients with OA and hypertension. The study is not planned to demonstrate pain reduction. AEs will also be assessed and compared among IT-102 and the comparator groups. The study could be completed in 12 months.
 
Both BE and phase III studies are to be conducted concurrently and followed by NDA submission of IT-102 for FDA approval by the 505(b)2 pathway.
 
IT-103 will undergo the same clinical developmental plan as IT-102, as summarized below:

Competition 
 
The competition for IT-102/IT-103 is expected to come from the oral anti-arthritic market, or more specifically the traditional non-selective NSAIDs (such as naproxen and diclofenac), traditional NSAID/gastroprotective agent combination products or combination product packages (such as Vimovo®, Arthrotec®, Prevacid® and NapraPAC™) and the only COX-2 inhibitor in the U.S. market, Celebrex® (including generic versions of Celebrex®). Currently Kitov is developing a celecoxib/amlodipine FDC using the same regulatory pathway outlined for IT-102/IT-103. We feel that IT-102/IT-103 are superior to Kitov’s drug candidate due to compatibility in drug half-life, no known drug-drug interaction, and no common adverse events (especially edema). Our advantages in comparison to Kitov’s drug candidate are shown below:
 

M101 
 
M101 is being developed as beta-catenin siRNA/celecoxib combination against FAP. This is a combination of IT-102 and CEQ508 (tkRNAi beta-catenin shRNA). Celecoxib was originally approved for FAP, however, it was removed from the market due to fear of cardiovascular risks during the VIOXX withdrawal. But with the PRECISION trial showing that celecoxib is as safe as ibuprofen and naproxen, we anticipate higher acceptance of celecoxib. Furthermore, with the addition of lisinopril to control edema and hypertension, we anticipate that high doses of celecoxib would be safe and effective against FAP. Additionally, the systemic suppression of COX-2 directly and beta-catenin indirectly with celecoxib will be augmented by targeted and local suppression of beta-catenin by beta-catenin shRNA (CEQ508). Together we anticipate a synergistic and safe and effective suppression of polyps in FAP. Since the completion of the phase I proof of concept study for CEQ508, we will move forward to registration phase III trial once we have FDA acceptance of Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”).
 
FAP is an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated incidence of approximately 1:10,000 persons and is a well described form of hereditary colorectal cancer (Bisgaard 1994, Neklason 2008, Steinbach 2000). FAP is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene located on chromosome 5, which results in low levels of functional APC protein required to regulate intracellular levels of beta-catenin. This dysregulation and accumulation of beta-catenin initiates an activation of downstream target genes, resulting in uncontrolled cellular proliferation, hyperplasia, adenoma formation, and an increased risk of colon cancer development (Kinzler 1996). In addition, the APC gene also plays a role in chromosome segregation through microtubule binding and cell polarity. Almost all of the cancer- causing mutations in the APC gene create a truncated gene devoid of its C-terminal region. Loss of the C-terminal region leads to chromosome instability, a hallmark of cancer (Kinzler 1996, Hanahan 2000). Typically, FAP results in the formation of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the large and small intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs 100% of the time when untreated. When the frequency of polyp formation exceeds the criteria for polypectomy as assessed by the physician, surgical intervention including a partial or complete colectomy is performed. Colectomies are typically performed in the late teenage years or early twenties. By age 35, 95% of individuals with FAP have developed polyps. Without surgical intervention, the mean age of colon cancer onset is 39 years of age (range of 34-43 years) (Trimbath 2002). In Attenuated FAP, the APC mutation resides in the 3’UTR (untranslated region) of the APC gene, resulting in a less severe phenotype of FAP. Patients usually develop fewer (<100) polyps, and the age at which polyp formation occurs is later than FAP. Colon cancer develops in these individuals as well but at a slower rate, typically after 40 years of age.
 
Duodenal/periampullary adenocarcinoma is the next leading cause of death in FAP patients following colorectal cancer (Vasen 2008). FAP patients are also at increased risk of developing other malignancies, including hepatoblastoma, pancreatic, thyroid, biliary tree, and brain tumors. Additionally, the risk of cancer forming in the remaining stump of the rectum and small intestine, after colectomy, remains high (Trimbath 2002, Vasen 2008).

Celecoxib for treatment of FAP
 
Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibiting NSAIDs has been thoroughly investigated as a potential chemopreventive drug. Overexpression of COX-2 has been identified in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. This overexpression was linked with reduced apoptosis, enhanced cell growth, tumor angiogenesis, tissue invasion and metastasis. This is likely attributed to the mechanism of COX-2, whereby expression of COX-2 prevents degradation of β-catenin protein increasing proliferation and survival. As such, the COX-2 specific inhibitor, celecoxib, has been utilized for the treatment of FAP patients.
 
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, treatment of celecoxib at 100 mg or 400 mg twice daily was compared against placebo for six months. Significant reduction in mean number of colorectal polyps (28% vs 4.5%, p = 0.003) and polyp burden assessed as the sum of polyp diameters (30.7% vs 4.9%, p = 0.001) was observed in patients treated with 400 mg twice daily compared with placebo (Steinbach et al. 2000). No significant reduction was observed in patients treated with 100 mg twice daily in terms of mean number of colorectal polyps (11.9%, p = 0.33) and polyp burden (14.6%, p = 0.09). In a similar study, 400 mg twice daily treatment of celecoxib showed significant reduction in area of duodenal polyposis (30.8% vs 8.3%, p = 0.049) of patients with >5% coverage at baseline compared to placebo (Phillips et al. 2002). No significant reduction was observed from treatment at 100 mg (26.6%, p = 0.252).
 

Evaluation of celecoxib for treatment of FAP was also evaluated in children with APC gene mutations and/or adenomas with a family history of FAP. Children were evaluated in a phase I, dose-escalation trial in three successive cohorts of six children (Lynch et al. 2010). Random assignment of subjects in a 2:1 generic:placebo ratio was conducted for cohort 1 (4 mg/kg/day) to cohort 2 (8 mg/kg/day) to cohort 3 (16 mg/kg/day). Colonoscopies were performed at baseline and month 3. At month 3, a 39.1% increase in number of polyps was observed in placebo patients whereas a 44.2% reduction was seen in the highest dose celecoxib group (p = 0.01). This corresponds with the adult dose of 400 mg BID and was shown to be safe and well tolerated. Reduction in number of polyps was also observed in the 8 mg/kg/day group (adult dose of 200 mg BID), with a 44.2% decrease. However, an increase of 69.7% was observed in patients treated at 4 mg/kg/day (adult dose 100 mg BID). In line with results observed in adult patients, high dose of celecoxib is most effective in treating patients with FAP.
 
Together, these studies have shown that celecoxib is effective in treating FAP at high doses (400 mg twice daily). However, although therapeutically effective, the high dose of celecoxib results in higher risk of cardiovascular adverse events. The increased risk has lowered the attractiveness of celecoxib as an effective treatment for FAP. However, should the risk be diminished, a novel and previously FDA approved drug would be available for treatment of a disease that currently has no effective treatment. This gap is to be filled with IT-102.

IT-102 is a fixed-dose combination of celecoxib, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, and lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor. The combination of an antihypertensive agent, e.g. lisinopril, with celecoxib is intended to suppress the cardiovascular side effects associated with high dose of celecoxib to offer a safe and tolerable therapeutic option for the medical management of FAP patients. Coupled with local and target suppression of beta-catenin by CEQ508 – we believe that M101 should be a safe and effective agent against FAP.
 
CEQ508 for treatment of FAP
 
TransKingdom RNA™ interference (tkRNAi) platform. tkRNAi is a broad-reaching platform that can be used to develop highly specific drug products for a diverse set of diseases. The tkRNAi platform involves the modification of bacteria to deliver shRNA to cells of the gastrointestinal tract. A significant advantage of the tkRNAi platform is oral (by mouth) delivery making this platform extremely patient friendly while harnessing the full potential of the RNAi process. The tkRNAi platform has demonstrated in vivo mRNA down-regulation of both inflammatory and cancer targets, thus providing a unique opportunity to develop RNAi-based therapeutics against inflammation and oncology diseases such as Crohn’s Disease, ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. For our own clinical pipeline, we have used the tkRNAi platform to discover and develop CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP as a beta-catenin siRNA knockdown.
 
Phase I proof of concept (“POC”) was conducted and the trial closed at meeting both its primary and secondary endpoints. START-FAP is a phase I dose-escalating study to evaluate safety and tolerability of single daily doses of CEQ508 in adult patients with FAP. Six patients with FAP were orally administered (3 each in Cohort 1 and 2) with CEQ-508 (108 and 109 colony forming units [CFU]/day for 28 days). The primary objective was to establish general safety for orally administered CEQ508 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The secondary objective was the effectiveness of CEQ508 on the gene expression of the target gene beta-catenin. Gene expression was evaluated in GI tissues (duodenum, ileum, right and left colon, antrum) taken during endoscopy examinations at baseline and at end-of-treatment (EOT). Expression levels were measured using qPCR and analyzed with ViiA™ 7 Real-Time system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Ct values of β-catenin were normalized to two of three housekeeping genes (EIF2B1, HPRT1, GUSβ). A mixed Nested-ANOVA model was used to evaluate beta-catenin knockdown in normal mucosa and polyps. This phase I trial of bacterial delivery of RNAi investigational agent CEQ508 in FAP patients demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and was well-tolerated at the two bacterial dose levels tested, with no MTD having been identified. Without hitting MTD, START-FAP achieved both primary endpoint of safety and secondary endpoint of beta-catenin knockdown.

Analysis of Ct values stratifying by tissue type showed a decrease in β-catenin expression moving down the gastrointestinal tract (Duodenum > Ileum > Colon > Antrum). A Mixed nested-ANOVA model was developed to compare the levels of β-catenin in the normal mucosa and polyps taken at baseline and EOT. Factors in the model included: an overall treatment effect (baseline or CEQ-508 treated); tissue (Duodenum, Ileum, Colon, Antrum); interaction term for treatment x tissue; replicate (1, 2, or 3) nested in treatment and tissue to take into account pseudo-replication of Ct values performed in triplicate for each sample; and a random factor identifying each patient to control from multiple measurements taken from each patient and the patient to patient variation was expressed as percentage of total variation accounted for by the random factor.
 
A statistical model was generated to test whether CEQ508 was successful in suppressing beta-catenin expression. The model developed by pooling data from both cohorts for normal mucosa samples explained a significant proportion of variation (R-squared = 0.64, P<0.0001; Patient to patient variation accounted for 48% of the total variation). No significant reduction in overall β-catenin expression was observed in EOT samples. Modeling of pooled data for polyp samples explained a significant proportion of variation (R-squared = 0.54, P<0.0001; Patient to patient variation accounted for 6% of the total variation). Significant reduction was observed in overall β-catenin expression in EOT samples (F1,113.1 = 6.87, P=0.01). Furthermore, significant reduction of β-catenin expression in the Duodenum was observed in EOT samples (Linear Contrast, Effect size = 0.363, 22.2% decrease, T = 2.75, P=0.007). 
 
Evaluation of individual cohorts was also examined. The model for cohort 1 in normal mucosa explained a significant proportion of variation (R-squared = 0.84, P<0.0001; Patient to patient variation accounted for 80% of the total variation). Nonstatistical significant reduction was observed in overall β-catenin expression in EOT samples (F1,46 = 6.03, P=0.018). Therefore, component analyses were deemed irrelevant and cohort 1 was declared not effective. The model for cohort 2 in polyps explained a significant proportion of variation (R-squared = 0.69, P<0.0001; Patient to patient variation accounted for 8.2% of the total variation). Significant reduction was observed in overall β-catenin expression at EOT (; F1,86.06 = 13.13, P=0.0005). There was a significant reduction of β-catenin expression in the Duodenum (Linear Contrast, Effect size = 0.72, 39.3% decrease, T = 5.3, P<0.0001) and Ileum (Effect size = 0.49, 28.8% decrease, T = 2.57, P=0.012).
 

Together, the data indicate a higher expression of β-catenin in the small intestine (duodenum, ileum) compared to the large intestine (colon, antrum). Additionally, the mixed nest-ANOVA model shows effective decrease in β-catenin mRNA from treatment of CEQ508. The models indicate that treatment at 108 CFU/day may not be effective enough at lowering β-catenin expression. However, significant effects were observed within the Duodenum and Ileum after treatment of 109 CFU/day of CEQ508. Furthermore, decrease in β-catenin was observed only in the polyps while not significant effects were observed within the normal mucosa. This shows that CEQ508 is a therapeutically effective and specifically targeted novel treatment for patients with FAP. In addition, CEQ508 was granted orphan drug designation and fast track designation by the FDA.
 
Clinical Program for M101: Combination of celecoxib and CEQ508
 
We believe that the effectiveness of CEQ508 and celecoxib justify the combination as M101. We plan to meet with the FDA to discuss an SPA with a clearly defined clinical design and endpoints for regulatory approval. The meeting is planned for 2017 and the trial may start in 2018 or 2019. If successful, we anticipate a potential launch of the product in 2023.

In addition, in March 2009, Marina granted to Novartis a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to the DiLA2-based siRNA delivery platform in consideration of a one-time, non-refundable fee of $7.25 million. Novartis may terminate this agreement immediately upon written notice.
 
Monsanto – On May 3, 2012, Marina and Monsanto entered into a worldwide exclusive Intellectual Property License Agreement for Marina’s delivery and chemistry technologies. Marina and Monsanto also entered into a Security Agreement pursuant to which Marina granted to Monsanto a security interest in that portion of its IP that is the subject of the License Agreement in order to secure the performance of Marina’s obligations under the License Agreement. Monsanto paid $1.5 million in initiation fees, and may be required to pay royalties on product sales in the low single digit percentages. Monsanto may terminate the License Agreement at any time in whole or as to any rights granted thereunder upon three months’ prior written notice.

ProNAi – On March 13, 2012, Marina entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with ProNAi regarding the development and commercialization of ProNAi’s proprietary DNAi-based therapeutics utilizing SMARTICLES. The License Agreement provides that ProNAi will have full responsibility for the development and commercialization of any products arising under the License Agreement. Under terms of the License Agreement, ProNAi may be required to pay up to $14 million for each gene target in upfront, clinical and commercialization milestone payments, as well as royalties in the single digit percentages on sales, with ProNAi having the option to select any number of gene targets. Either party may terminate the License Agreement upon the occurrence of a default by the other party (subject to standard cure periods), or upon certain events involving the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. ProNAi may also terminate the License Agreement without cause upon ninety (90) days’ prior written notice. ProNAi’s clinical compound utilizing SMARTICLES, PNT2258, is a first-in-class, 24-base, single-stranded, chemically-unmodified DNA oligonucleotide drug targeting BCL2, which proceeded to a phase 2 clinical study. In June 2016, ProNAi suspended the development of PNT2258 based on its review of the interim results from a phase 2 trial of PNT2258.
 
Mirna – We have a License Agreement with Mirna regarding the development and commercialization of miRNA-based therapeutics utilizing Mirna’s proprietary miRNAs and SMARTICLES. The License Agreement provides that Mirna will have full responsibility for the development and commercialization of any products arising under the License Agreement and that Marina will support pre-clinical and process development efforts. Under terms of the License Agreement, Mirna could be required to pay up to $63 million in upfront, clinical and commercialization milestone payments, as well as royalties in the low single digit percentages on sales, based on the successful development of Mirna’s product candidates. Either party may terminate the License Agreement upon the occurrence of a default by the other party. Mirna may also terminate the License Agreement without cause upon 60 days prior written notice. The License Agreement provides Mirna additional rights to its lead program, MRX34. Mirna also has exclusivity on several additional miRNA targets. Mirna’s clinical compound utilizing SMARTICLES, MRX34, is a double-stranded miRNA “mimic” of the naturally occurring tumor suppressor miR-34, which inhibits cell cycle progression and induces cancer cell death. Mirna has voluntarily halted the phase 1 trial of MRX34 for the treatment of patients with unresectable primary liver cancer or solid cancers with liver involvement.
 
Novosom – On July 27, 2010, Marina acquired the intellectual property of Novosom AG (“Novosom”) of Halle, Germany for SMARTICLES. Marina is required to pay to Novosom an amount equal to 30% of the value of each upfront (or combined) payment actually received in respect of the license of liposomal-based delivery technology or related product or disposition of the liposomal-based delivery technology by Marina, up to $3.3 million, which amount will be paid in shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Marina’s discretion. To date Marina, has issued an aggregate of 2.5 million shares of common stock to Novosom representing additional consideration of $1.2 million as a result of license agreements and amendments thereto that Marina has entered into.
 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals – On March 23, 2010, Marina acquired intellectual property related to the CRN chemistry from Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America (“Valeant”). Subject to meeting certain milestones triggering the obligation to make any such payments, we may be obligated to make a product development milestone payment of $5.0 million and $2.0 million within 180 days of FDA approval of a NDA for our first and second CRN related product, respectively. To date, we had not made any such milestone payments but have milestone obligations of $0.1 million based on CRN licenses to date. Valeant is entitled to receive earn-outs based upon a percentage in the low single digits of future commercial sales and earn-outs based upon a percentage in the low double digits of future revenue from sublicensing. We are required to pay Valeant an annual amount equal to $50,000 per assigned patent which shall be creditable against other payment obligations. The term of our financial obligations under the agreement shall end, on a country-by-country basis, when there no longer exists any valid claim in such country. We may terminate the agreement upon 30-day notice, or upon 10-day notice in the event of adverse results from clinical studies.


Proprietary Rights and Intellectual Property
 
We rely primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There can be no assurance that any of our patents will guarantee protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. We also use license agreements both to access external technologies and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. Our financial success will be dependent in part on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims and to protect our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. As of March 9, 2017, we owned or controlled 140 issued or allowed patents, and approximately 73 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, to protect our proprietary technologies.

Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete, or may compete, with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.
 
The commercial opportunity for our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs.
 
Our main competition for the celecoxib FDCs is Kitov – which already been discussed in the sections on IT-102/IT-103. With respect to our RNAi technologies, there are a number of small, mid-sized and large biotechnology companies, as well as public and private research institutions, that compete, or that may compete, with us. Our competition is typically focused on a single nucleic acid mechanism of action, i.e. RNAi or mRNA translational inhibition or exon skipping or miRNA replacement therapy. Some of these companies only have a proprietary position around either chemistry or delivery and in fewer cases, their proprietary position arises from their belief that they can patent biology, i.e. miRNA targets. We believe we are the only company in the position of having proprietary chemistry and delivery technologies sufficient to pursue multiple nucleic acid mechanisms of action, i.e. RNAi and mRNA translational inhibition and exon skipping and miRNA replacement therapy. Such single mechanism of action competitors include: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Arcturus Therapeutics, Benitec Biopharma, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Isis Pharmaceuticals (“Isis”), miRagen Therapeutics, Mirna, PhaseRx Pharmaceuticals, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Regulus Therapeutics, RXi Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics (“Sarepta”) and Silence Therapeutics.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drugs and biologic products. All of our foreseeable product candidates (including those for human use that may be developed by our partners based on our licensed technologies) are expected to be regulated as drug products.
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and other laws within the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecutions. Before our drug products are marketed they must be approved by the FDA. The steps required before a novel drug product is approved by the FDA include: (1) pre-clinical laboratory, animal, and formulation tests; (2) submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; (3) adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product for each indication for which approval is sought; (4) submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); (5) satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and FDA review; and finally (6) approval of an NDA.

Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions, such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. There can be no assurance that submission of an IND will result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Once an IND is in effect, each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified physician-investigators and healthcare personnel. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 usually involves the initial administration of the investigational drug or biologic product to healthy individuals to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacodynamics. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, with the disease or condition for which the test material is being developed, to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks; and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the drug or biologic candidate in its final form in an expanded patient population. Our product development partners, the FDA, or we may suspend clinical trials, if any, at any time on various grounds, including any situation where we or our partners believe that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or are obtaining no medical benefit from the test material.
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical trials and the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Before approving an application, the FDA will usually inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA determines the NDA is not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the NDA and often will request additional information. If the FDA approves the NDA, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP in December 2010.
 
In addition, regardless of the type of approval, we and our partners are required to comply with a number of FDA requirements both before and after approval. For example, we and our partners are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for products. In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market.
 
Product Liability
 
We currently do not carry product liability insurance as no patients are currently being treated with our products. We may renew our product liability insurance portfolio if patient access to our products is resumed.

Environmental Compliance
 
Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specific waste products. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant and may adversely affect capital expenditures to the extent we are required to procure expensive capital equipment to meet regulatory requirements. At this time, we are not conducting any R&D activities that require compliance with federal, state or local laws.
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we have four employees, all of whom are officers of our company, and all of whom – other than Mr. Ramelli, our Chief Executive Officer – spend a portion of their time working for other entities that are affiliated with our company.
