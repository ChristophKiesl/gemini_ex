Item 1.Business
Overview
​
Tabula Rasa HealthCare, Inc. is a healthcare technology company advancing the safe use of medications by creating solutions designed to empower pharmacists, providers, and patients to optimize medication regimens. Our advanced proprietary technology, MedWise®, identifies causes of and risks for medication-related problems, including adverse drug events (“ADEs”), so that healthcare professionals can minimize harm and reduce medication-related risks. Our software and services help drive valued-based care by improving patient outcomes and lowering healthcare costs through reduced hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and healthcare utilization. Our vision and mission are supported by our experienced leadership team, our significant investments in our technology, services, and people, and partnerships with our healthcare clients including health plans and provider organizations to manage the most complex and vulnerable individuals.
​
 We operate our business through two segments, CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare.
​
Our CareVention HealthCare segment provides our clients, primarily organizations with PACE, with medication fulfillment services, cloud-based software, pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, and clinical pharmacist services at the point-of-care. PACE is a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) sponsored program providing comprehensive medical and social services to adults aged 55 and older who need a nursing facility level of care but can live safely in community settings. Our clients include ArchCare Senior Life, Trinity Health, Palm Beach PACE, St. Paul’s PACE, and Welbe Health. We access the market through a number of different service lines and brands, including CareKinesis®, Capstone Risk Adjustment Services, CareVention Consulting™, PACElogic™, TruChart®, PeakTPA, PersonifilRx®, and Pharmastar®.
​
Our largest CareVention HealthCare revenue offering is our medication fulfillment services, which are built around our advanced proprietary MedWise technology, designed to enable clinicians to increase patient safety, create individualized medication regimens, promote adherence, and eliminate unnecessary prescriptions. Our medication fulfillment and adherence packaging services utilize MedWise technology to reduce medication-related risk for the high-cost, high-risk PACE population. The CareVention HealthCare suite of offerings also includes risk adjustment services, PBM solutions, cloud-based electronic health records solutions, and third-party administration services, which are all specifically tailored to the PACE market. Our CareVention HealthCare segment serves more than 150 healthcare organizations.
​
The CareVention HealthCare segment revenue model is primarily based on payments for charges and dispensing fees for medication fulfillment, payments on a per-member, per-month (“PMPM”) basis, payments on a subscription basis, and payments on a per claim basis.
​
Our MedWise HealthCare segment provides technology-enabled solutions to promote medication safety and adherence to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The technology-enabled solutions revenue model is primarily based on payments on a PMPM basis, payments on a subscription basis, and payments on a fee-for-service basis for each medication safety review and clinical assessment completed.
​
As described further below under “Divestiture of Non-Core Businesses,” we completed the sale of our PrescribeWellness business in 2022 and completed the sales of our DoseMe and SinfoníaRx businesses in January and March 2023, respectively. These non-core businesses collectively comprised the majority of our MedWise HealthCare segment during 2022, with PrescribeWellness representing the most significant portion of this segment, and these

divestitures represented a strategic business shift having a significant effect on our Company’s operations and financial results.
​
Substantially all of our revenue is recognized in the U.S., and substantially all of our assets are located in the U.S.
​
Industry and Market
​
We believe demographic, legislative, and regulatory trends support our long-term growth targets. Our core market is the U.S. senior population, defined as individuals 65 years and older, which represent a large and growing segment within the U.S. as seniors are living longer with the current life expectancy in 2023 at 79.1 years according to the United Nations. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of U.S. seniors is expected to grow to 73.1 million by 2030, up from 56.1 million in 2020, and to increase as a percentage of the population from 17% to 21% over the same period.
​
We believe there is a significant opportunity to scale our business by addressing the growing need to optimize medication regimens for seniors. An April 2020 report from the Lown Institute noted that polypharmacy (defined as the simultaneous use of five or more medications) has reached “epidemic proportions.” The Lown Institute also stated in that report that 40% of seniors are taking five or more prescription medications to treat the growing prevalence of multiple chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, and cancer.
​
Our solutions, as evidenced by a number of peer-reviewed publications, result in improved outcomes for the individual and a material reduction in the total cost of care for health plans. Medicare provides health insurance for individuals 65 and older and in 2021 Medicare spending totaled $829 billion. Medicare spending is expected to grow to $1.8 trillion in 2031 due to growing Medicare enrollment increased use of services and intensity of care, and rising healthcare costs.
​
From a legislative and regulatory perspective, we believe there are important drivers to support future growth including: the long-term transition to value-based care, led by CMS, which established a goal to reach 100% of Medicare beneficiaries in some type of value-based model by 2025; CMS Medicare Part C and Part D Star Ratings, which are published annually and measure the quality of health and drug services received by consumers; and a number of bills introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate focused on increasing the number of individuals that have access to PACE, our largest market today, including: the House and Senate including the Elizabeth Dole VA Home and Community Based Services for Veterans and Caregivers Act of 2022; the PACE Part D Choice Act; and the PACE Plus Act.
​
Our Growth Strategy
​
We continue to progress toward the long-term growth strategy that we articulated in early 2020. Continued achievement of this long-term growth is based on two key tenets: 
​

1) | Further penetration of the PACE market by:
---+-------------------------------------------


a. | Leveraging our existing client base, which includes more than 80% of all PACE participants utilizing at least one of our solutions and cross-selling to increase our average revenue per participant;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

b. | Organic member growth within our existing clients based upon (i) the growing number of individuals enrolling in Medicare and Medicaid, (ii) the evolution from the National PACE Association’s PACE 2.0 initiative to the PACE 200K project, which is designed to significantly increase enrollment to 200,000 by 2028, as compared to 63,606 as of December 2022 according to the National PACE Association, and (iii) the growing influence of for-profit PACE operators such as InnovAge and WelbeHealth; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

c. | Continued investments in our offerings to attract new PACE members and, more broadly, managed care organizations and at-risk provider groups with a focus on the more than 12 million dual-eligible beneficiaries.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

Our PACE clients had a combined patient census of 53,430, an increase of 7.4%, at the end of 2022, as compared to 49,769 and 44,947 patients at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 10.7% growth in patient census for 2021, as compared to 2020, benefited from inorganic growth from the October 2020 acquisition of Personica. 
​

2) | Accelerating the adoption of our MedWise software and clinical pharmacy programs by health plans across all lines of business, including Medicare Part C and Part D, Medicaid managed care, and commercial clients.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Further Penetrate the Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Older Adult Market
​
We believe that we are the market leader in providing medication risk management services to PACE, a CMS-sponsored program through which participating healthcare organizations provide fully integrated healthcare services on an at-risk basis for older adults, most of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Our medication management, together with pharmacy fulfillment PACE clients, cover approximately 32% of the total PACE enrollees nationwide reported by the National PACE Association at the end of 2022, as compared to 30% at the end of 2021.
​
We have organized our PACE offerings under our CareVention HealthCare segment that offers a comprehensive set of solutions, including medication management services and fulfillment, PBM solutions, risk adjustment services, third-party administrator services, and electronic health records software. By organizing our sales and marketing resources, we have streamlined efforts to facilitate cross-selling and increase the adoption of our services. 
 ​
We believe that we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow within the PACE market, and we expect our PACE clients to continue to grow organically to cover more eligible lives through expansion of existing sites and new PACE center locations. Based on recent industry data, there are 2.2 million PACE-eligible individuals in the U.S., which equates to a current penetration rate of approximately 3%. In 2023, the National PACE Association will launch its PACE 200K project with the goal of 200,000 participants by 2028. 
​
Continue Expansion into the Payer and At-Risk Provider Markets
​
We believe that the growth of government healthcare programs and the shift to value-based care models are creating opportunities to capture growing portions of the expanding healthcare market. Accordingly, we are actively targeting at-risk, value-based markets, including managed care organizations, physician provider groups, and self-insured employer groups. We have recently started leveraging our CareVention HealthCare portfolio of services to secure contracts with a number of start-up Medicare Advantage plans and at-risk provider groups, and we expect to continue to further penetrate the broader Medicare and Medicaid market with our solutions
​
Continue to Innovate and Expand Platform Offerings to Meet Evolving Market Needs
​
We believe our strategic investments in human capital, technology, and services position us to continue to pursue rapid innovation and expand our medication risk management solutions and other platform offerings to the broader healthcare marketplace. For example, we developed the MedWise Risk Score™ (the “MRS”) and launched associated high-throughput medication risk stratification technology for identification of patients in need of clinical intervention.
​
Divestiture of Non-Core Businesses
​
In February 2022, we announced plans to evaluate non-core assets to refocus our corporate strategy and increase stockholder value, and we commenced an initial plan to sell the DoseMe business, which we acquired in January 2019. In March 2022, we completed our evaluation of additional divestiture opportunities and commenced plans to sell the SinfoníaRx and PrescribeWellness businesses, acquired in September 2017 and March 2019, respectively. As described further below, we completed our sales of the PrescribeWellness, DoseMe, and SinfoníaRx business in August 2022, January 2023, and March 2023, respectively. We determined that these businesses met the requirements to be classified as held for sale and discontinued operations as of March 31, 2022, and the DoseMe and SinfoníaRx businesses continued to meet such requirements as of December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been recast for all periods presented to reflect the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses related to these businesses as discontinued operations.

​
On August 1, 2022 (the “PW Sale Date”), we completed the sale of our unincorporated PrescribeWellness business division (the “PrescribeWellness Business”), and the assets, properties, and rights that were primarily used or held for use in connection with the PrescribeWellness Business, and the KD Assets (as defined below), to Transaction Data Systems, Inc. (“TDS”). On the PW Sale Date, we also completed the acquisition of certain intellectual property from karmadata, Inc. (“KD”), which had historically been licensed to us (the “KD Assets”). The KD Assets acquired were simultaneously transferred to TDS on the PW Sale Date. The purchase consideration included $125 million in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, of which $118.6 million was paid directly to us and $5.9 million was paid to KD on the PW Sale Date. In October 2022, TDS also paid us $1.5 million for certain customary post-closing adjustments. We are also entitled to receive up to $15.0 million in contingent consideration based upon the PrescribeWellness Business’s achievement of certain performance-based metrics during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 and 2024.
​
On January 20, 2023, we entered into a Share and Asset Purchase Agreement to sell our unincorporated DoseMe business (the “DoseMe Business”), and the assets, properties, and rights that are primarily used or held for use in connection with the DoseMe Business. The purchase consideration included $2.0 million in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, and a note receivable of $3.0 million with an annual interest rate of 7%, which matures on January 20, 2027.
​
On March 2, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell our unincorporated SinfoníaRx business (the “SinfoníaRx Business”), and the assets, properties, and rights that are primarily used or held for use in connection with the SinfoníaRx Business. The purchase consideration included $1.4 million in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, and a note receivable of $3.6 million with an annual interest rate of 3%, which matures on December 31, 2023. We may also be entitled to receive up to $1.0 million in contingent consideration based upon potential regulatory changes affecting the business.
​
We used the cash proceeds from the sale of the PrescribeWellness Business to pay off our line of credit with Western Alliance Bank (the “2020 Credit Facility”) and increase our liquidity. The remaining cash proceeds, along with cash proceeds received and promissory notes from the divestitures of the DoseMe and SinfoníaRx businesses, will provide our Company with the financial flexibility to optimize our capital structure, as well as to focus on our core value-based care business and our MedWise science, including our offerings targeted at the PACE market.
When the Company commenced plans to sell the PrescribeWellness, DoseMe, and SinfoníaRx businesses, these businesses collectively comprised the majority of our MedWise HealthCare segment, with PrescribeWellness representing the most significant portion of this segment. The disposition of these non-core businesses represents the completion of our previously-announced strategic business shift. 
Strategic Review
​
On September 13, 2022, we entered into a cooperation agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) with a significant stockholder, pursuant to which, among other matters, we agreed to effect certain changes to our management team and the composition of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and implement certain corporate governance changes. In connection with the Cooperation Agreement, we also formed a Strategic Review Committee, which oversaw the Company’s strategic process relating to the sale of the non-core assets described above and continues to oversee management’s exploration of other strategic alternatives and value-creation opportunities with a view toward maximizing stockholder value. For further information regarding the Cooperation Agreement, refer to Note 21, “Related Party Transactions,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Most of our personalized medication risk management services are based on our MedWise® Science. For each patient, MedWise Science incorporates personal medical history data, summarizes the aggregate risk of the patient’s medications based on proprietary algorithms, and provides patient-specific clinical alerts for risk, including cognitive impairment, sedation, heart rhythm problems, and unintentional overdose. MedWise results may be utilized by prescribers independently or analyzed by our pharmacists to optimize patient medication regimens. Elements of MedWise are currently available in EireneRx®, TruChart®, and PACElogic™.
​
EireneRx
​
EireneRx is our cloud-based medication decision-support and e-prescribing platform. It includes an order entry module used by healthcare organizations to access patient medication-related information and our personalized proprietary MedWise Science on demand. EireneRx provides a shared patient medication profile that enables client-clinicians and our pharmacists to collaborate on medication management in real time. EireneRx provides MedWise dashboards, as well as a secure instant messaging feature, through which our pharmacists and PACE clinicians can communicate. EireneRx is integrated with our prescription fulfillment pharmacies and is capable of transmitting prescriptions to community pharmacies in the U.S. 
​
TruChart
​
TruChart offers electronic health records (“EHR”), care coordination, and financial management in one program, allowing PACE programs to track measurable outcomes in defined timeframes for the populations they serve. Developed specifically for PACE, TruChart is a comprehensive, scalable, and secure technology solution that delivers PACE functionality. TruChart covers end-to-end functionality to manage care coordination, enrollments, authorizations, utilization management, scheduling, claims payment, interfaces, and reporting. 
​

PACElogic delivers neatly organized, real-time shareable workflows covering all aspects of operations for PACE organizations and other small health plans. Capable of integrating with any EHR, PACElogic also delivers value as a robust, stand-alone solution. PACElogic offers an array of best-of-breed features, including EHR, customer relationship management, claims adjudication, electronic data interchange, care management, coordination and planning, integration with community-based providers, and all federal and state required reporting. PACElogic brings clinical and non-clinical data together into a unified health plan management system.
​
Our Services
​
Our clinical pharmacist collaboration service, prescription fulfillment, and adherence packaging service, health plan management services, including risk adjustment and third-party administrator services, and pharmacy benefit management services are designed to improve patient experiences and outcomes and contain costs. The revenue models under these service contracts typically include a fee assessed for each medication review, payments on a PMPM basis, payments on a subscription basis, and charges and dispensing fees for medication fulfillment.
​
Clinical Pharmacist Collaboration
​
We have teams of clinical pharmacists dedicated to performing medication safety reviews (the “MSRs”). These interventions include one-on-one consultations with patients, as well as communications with prescribers. Clinical pharmacist recommendations can include guidance based on the clinical application of pharmacogenomic test results, assessment of the MedWise findings and of patient medical history, and optimization of medication regimens. Our clinical pharmacists provide these personalized medication recommendations through real-time digital and verbal communications. We provide clinical decision support, medication safety recommendations, and adherence support for patients nationwide.
​
Prescription Fulfillment and Adherence Packaging
​
We operate four prescription fulfillment pharmacies strategically located to efficiently distribute medications nationwide. Informed by each patient’s personalized MedWise Matrix, we package medications, synchronize fills, and aggregate doses by day and time-of-day. These measures increase the ease of adherence by patients to their optimized 

10




medication regimens. Using robotic dispensing machines, our scalable, high-performance systems allow for an array of medication packaging options that include multi-dose, deep-well cards and multi-dose pouches.
​
Health Plan Management
​
Our health plan management services include risk adjustment services through our Capstone Risk Adjustment Services offerings and third-party administration services through our PeakTPA service offerings.
​
Long-term optimization of risk adjustment outcomes is complex and, for many organizations, significantly affects financial performance. We take a prospective approach to risk adjustment beyond the typical strategy of providing retrospective reviews and claims data analysis. We specialize in helping clients optimize processes and systems to capture timely, complete, and accurate data. Through these services, we help PACE and other healthcare organizations remain compliant with regulations, make reliable comparisons to internal and external benchmarks and identify high-volume/high-cost issues for quality program initiatives.
​
We provide third-party administrator services that optimize health plans’ financial management functions and fulfill regulatory requirements. Our expertise in health plan management, particularly in PACE, enables our clients to focus on delivering high-quality care to their members. Our services include enrollment management, accounts receivable, claims adjudication, risk adjustment data submission, encounter data processing and submission, and Medicare Part D data submission.
​
Pharmacy Benefit Management Solutions
​
We provide PBM solutions to PACE and commercial organizations. These capabilities cover a broad range of administrative and clinical functions, including: claims processing, rebate administration and direct and indirect renumeration reporting, drug utilization review programs, prescription drug event management, compliance and audit risk, plan-to-plan management, annual Medicare Part D bids, coordination of benefits, true out-of-pocket cost support, and government and state-level reporting.
​
Our Clients
​
Our clients are typically at-risk healthcare organizations, primarily PACE organizations, managed-care organizations, government and commercial health plans, and other provider groups. We have strong and long-standing relationships with our clients, in many cases providing services under multi-year contracts. As of December 31, 2022, our largest segment, our CareVention HealthCare segment, served more than 150 healthcare organizations, predominantly PACE organizations.
​
PACE Organizations
​
PACE, a federal and state collaboration, is one of only three established models serving the more than 12 million dual-eligible patient population in the U.S. and focuses on preventing institutional-based placement. PACE embodies many of the characteristics and trends affecting the healthcare industry as a whole: specifically, value-based payment models and the desire for seniors to age in place. We believe we are the market-leader in providing medication risk management technology and services to PACE organizations, which are responsible for individuals who typically have complex medication regimens. Our PACE clients utilizing our medication risk management and pharmacy fulfillment services covered approximately 32% of the total PACE enrollees nationwide at the end of 2022. In addition, we also provide a suite of complementary solutions to assist PACE organizations with clinical, financial, and administrative operations.
​
Managed Care Organizations
​
According to CMS, at the end of 2022, 53.0 million Americans were enrolled in Medicare Part C (i.e., Medicare Advantage) and Part D (Prescription Drug Plan or PDP), a 3.0% increase as compared to the end of 2021, driven by growth in Medicare Advantage. In the past decade, the number of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans has more than doubled to 29.6 million in 2022. MA enrollment increased 8.4% in 2022 and total enrollment is expected to grow to more than 40 million by 2030. The Congressional Budget Office projects that MA will increase to nearly 51% of total Medicare enrollment or more than 80 million Americans by 2030. According to 

11




Medicaid.gov, there were 47.6 million adult lives covered under Medicaid as of October 2022, which represents an increase of 3.4 million lives since the end of 2021. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 156.2 million Americans, or 49% of the country’s total population, are covered under employer-sponsored health insurance. Many of the health plans with which we currently contract have multiple lines of business spanning Medicare, Medicaid, and the self-funded employer market. We currently provide a range of clinical programs, including MSRs, to these markets. We believe our solutions are broadly applicable throughout the managed care landscape, including to self-funded employer groups.
​
At-Risk Provider Groups
​
We contract with at-risk provider groups across the country to provide risk adjustment services, care transition support, and comprehensive medication management services. With respect to our comprehensive medication management services, we risk-stratify patient cohorts for these groups and identify patients at risk for medication problems. We then collaborate with these groups on interventions to mitigate that risk. These interventions are performed by our clinical teams, or in some cases, by employees of the at-risk provider who we have trained and certified.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We create, own, and maintain various intellectual property assets that, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. Our intellectual property assets include: six issued patents and nineteen pending patent applications related to our innovations, products, and services; trademarks related to our brands, products, and services; copyrights in software, documentation, content, and databases; and trade secrets relating to data processing, statistical methodologies, data security, and other aspects of our business.

​
Our Competitive Landscape
​
We compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses. We believe that the competitive landscape is highly fragmented with no single competitor offering our novel, multi-drug interaction software and similarly expansive capabilities and solution offerings. Our competitive advantage is largely based on our proprietary multi-drug interaction software, healthcare industry expertise, breadth and depth of services, intellectual property, including six patents issued or pending, ease of use, reputation, innovation, security, price, reliability, and client service. Our multi-drug interaction software has been developed over the course of three decades. A competitive challenge is to demonstrate to our existing and potential clients the value of utilizing our platforms rather than developing or assembling their own alternative capabilities or utilizing providers who offer a subset of our services. However, we believe that the combination of our competitive strengths and successful culture of innovation, including the real-world-tested nature of our solutions and subject matter expertise of our team members, makes it time- and cost-prohibitive for our clients or competitors to replace or replicate all that we offer.
​
Current industry participants that offer medication risk management services include large and small healthcare data analytics and consulting companies, community and long-term care pharmacies, national pharmacy providers, health plans, genomic testing labs, and healthcare information technology companies. Many of our competitors’ solutions are regulatory-driven, retrospective in nature, and offer no intervention at the point of care. The services offered by these organizations may include e-prescribing and EHRs utilizing antiquated drug interaction analysis, lab-based genomic evaluation, basic risk stratification solutions, and other traditional approaches to MTM. Many health plans attempt to address non-adherence solely through outreach efforts, which often require in-house or third-party consultants and have low success rates. Many genomic testing labs lack the ability to apply patient test results in a useful way at the point of care. Post-acute providers typically employ pharmacist consultants to review prescription regimens every 30 days, which is retrospective in nature and generally less effective in improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, typical prescription fulfillment models are reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis and are incentivized based on prescription dispensing volumes. Our clients partner with us to mitigate and prevent medication problems, lower healthcare costs, and improve overall health outcomes, which often involve utilizing our software to optimize prescription regimens.
​
While we believe that no competitor provides a similar breadth and depth of solutions, we nevertheless compete with other companies’ specific products or solutions and markets or care settings. For example, traditional, single drug-to-drug interaction databases are provided by Wolters Kluwer, Elsevier, and Hearst Health. Additional competitors across both of our major market segments include our health plan clients that opt to in-source clinical programs (such as MTM), as well as external vendors such as Cardinal Health, Adhere Health, RxAnte, Cureatr, Aspen RxHealth, Clarest Health, Pack4U, and MedWatchers. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. The continued growth in healthcare spending, the ongoing shift to value-based payment models, such as PACE and Medicare Advantage, and changes in government regulation may draw increasing attention and generate new competitors, such as management consultants, traditional technology companies, and start-ups that may enter the market.
​
Regulatory Environment
​
We operate in a highly regulated industry and our business operations must comply with a number of complex and evolving federal and state agency requirements. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these laws can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the state and federal interpretation of existing laws and regulations, and their enforcement, may change from time to time. Additionally, a state or federal government enforcement body may disagree that we are in material compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business.
​

To date, there has been no material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements or competitive positions as a result of these government regulations. Refer to “Risks Related to Industry Regulation and Other Legal Compliance Matters” in the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A. of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the potential impacts of government regulation on our business.
​
A non-exhaustive list of federal and state statutes, regulations, sub-regulatory guidance, and contractual provisions that may apply to our business activities includes:
​
Healthcare Legislation
​
In 2010, Congress passed major health reform legislation, mostly through the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). Generally, the ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while containing overall healthcare costs. Following passage, the U.S. government has issued numerous rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the ACA. While not all of these rules, regulations, and reforms affect our business directly, many continue to affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our clients.
​
The Biden administration and the United States Congress are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals that could, if passed into law, impact the healthcare system, the ACA, and/or the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Congress is considering legislation to increase the number of individuals covered by the Medicare or Medicaid programs, reduce prescription drug costs, increase price transparency for consumers, restrict the sale of certain classes of drugs, and reform medication management practices. While not all of the potential legislation, if enacted, would affect our business directly, much of it could indirectly impact some or many of our business arrangements, if not directly. In addition, regulatory agencies have separately implemented price transparency rules for hospitals and insurers that, while not impacting our business directly, could change the way we interact with these entities. Given that legislative and regulatory change is still being formulated, we cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of any future legislation or regulation.
​
There has been a trend in federal and state legislation aimed at lowering costs for drug products, including by requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose information about their pricing and production and marketing costs, and heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. There have been several presidential executive orders and U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, on October 10, 2018 the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act (for private plans) and the Know the Lowest Price Act (for Medicare Parts C and D) were signed into law, which prohibited health plans from restricting pharmacies from informing individuals regarding prices for certain drugs. 
​
On August 15, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law by President Biden. This legislation is intended to lower prescription drug costs for people with Medicare and reduce drug spending by the federal government. The prescription drug provisions included in the Inflation Reduction Act will require the federal government to negotiate prices for some drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Part D with the highest total spending, beginning in 2026, and require drug companies to pay rebates to Medicare if prices rise faster than inflation for drugs used by Medicare beneficiaries, beginning in 2023. We are unable at this time to assess any impact this legislation may have on our business.
​
PACE Organizations
​
Our partnership with PACE organizations is a significant source of our current revenue stream. The PACE program is a unique, comprehensive managed care benefit for older adults, most of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid benefits, provided by a not-for-profit or public entity. The PACE program features a comprehensive medical and social service delivery system using an interdisciplinary team approach in an adult day health center that is supplemented by in-home and referral services in accordance with participants’ needs. Financing for the program is capped, which allows providers to deliver all needed services rather than only those reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service plans. PACE is a program under Medicare, and states can elect to provide PACE services to Medicaid program beneficiaries as an optional Medicaid benefit. The PACE program becomes the sole

source of Medicaid and Medicare benefits for PACE participants. According to the National PACE Association, as of January 2023, there are 149 PACE programs operating in 32 states.
​
HIPAA Healthcare Fraud Provisions
​
In addition to privacy protections, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created and expanded federal criminal statutes regarding fraud. Specifically, the HIPAA healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or to obtain by false or fraudulent pretenses any of the money or property owned by a healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. The HIPAA healthcare fraud statutes also prohibit, among other things, concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. The ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA, like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Noncompliance with the AKS can result in exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs and civil and criminal penalties.

The AKS is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. To create better clarity, the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has issued regulations as "safe harbor" guidelines which if met in form and substance, will assure healthcare providers that they will not be prosecuted for violation of the Anti-kickback Statute. The OIG issued a final rule on November 20, 2020, as part of the Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care initiative by HHS that, among other things, established new "safe harbors" under the AKS for certain value-based compensation arrangements. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the AKS, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the AKS will be pursued.
​
State and Federal Data Privacy and Security Laws
​
We process, collect, use, and disclose individual patient data directly or for our clients and, therefore, we are subject to various laws protecting privacy and security of that patient information. Certain businesses of our company qualify as a “Covered Entity” under HIPAA, and others qualify as a “Business Associate” to our partners who are Covered Entities. We are required to comply with HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act as implemented through regulations promulgated thereunder by HHS, which include the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the HIPAA Security Rule. HIPAA generally requires Covered Entities and their Business Associates (each as defined therein) to adopt certain safeguards to ensure the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, and to limit uses and disclosures of such PHI to those permissible under the law. When Covered Entities utilize Business Associates to provide services, pursuant to which the Business Associate may access the Covered Entity’s PHI, the parties must enter into a Business Associate Agreement through which the Business Associate must contractually agree to safeguard PHI in certain ways and to notify the Covered Entity of improper uses or disclosures of PHI.
​
Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to have written policies and procedures addressing HIPAA compliance and must designate a Security Officer to oversee the development and implementation of the policies and procedures related to the safeguards to protect privacy of electronic PHI. Covered Entities must also designate a Privacy Officer (as defined in HIPAA), although the Privacy Officer and the Security Officer may be the same person. As part of their security policies and procedures, Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to conduct periodic risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities to electronic PHI. Additionally, Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to train all employees on their HIPAA policies and procedures. Further, in the event of a breach of PHI as defined by HIPAA, Covered Entities must notify affected individuals, HHS, and sometimes the media, and must take steps to mitigate damage, and they may be subject to fines and penalties. HIPAA violations can result in significant civil monetary penalties and/or imprisonment for up to ten years depending on the facts surrounding the violation.
​

Many states also have similar data privacy and security laws that track federal requirements or impose different and/or more stringent conditions for use and disclosure of PHI. Failure to comply with these laws may also result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) imposes rules governing how businesses handle personal data of California residents. Companies that do business in California are, as of January 1, 2020, required to disclose the types of data they collect, the purpose for the data collection, and how the data will be used and to expand organizational responsibilities pertaining to individual rights, accountability, and governance. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), which was effective on January 1, 2023. The CPRA expands the CCPA and establishes a California regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing data privacy compliance requirements. Other states are considering legislation similar to the CCPA and the CPRA, which could expand our data protection obligations.
​
Federal and State Oversight of Medical Devices, Genomic Testing, Drugs, and Controlled Substances 
​
Some technologies and software applications used in connection with healthcare analytics and genomic testing and analysis are considered medical devices and are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255) (“Cures Act”), enacted in December 2016, included certain changes to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt certain medical-related software from FDA regulation. In December 2017, the FDA issued a draft guidance document describing the FDA’s proposed interpretation of the exemption under the Cures Act for clinical decision support, (“CDS”), software. The FDA issued the final version of this CDS software guidance document in September 2022, which represents a more conservative interpretation of the CDS software exemption under the Cures Act. The 2022 final guidance also does not include any policies of enforcement discretion. Although we believe that our technologies and software are not subject to active FDA regulation, there is a risk that the FDA could disagree. If the FDA determines that any of our current or future services, technologies, or software applications are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, we would become subject to various statutes, regulations, and policies enforced by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including both pre-market and post-market requirements, and we would need to ensure that the affected services, technologies, and/or software comply with such requirements. The FDA could also require that we cease marketing and/or recall the affected services, technologies, and/or software unless and until they comply with the FDA’s requirements.
​
Clinical laboratories that perform human genomic testing are subject to oversight by CMS and state regulators. The laboratories that we contract with for genomic testing must comply with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to clinical laboratories and genomic testing, including the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”). To date, there have been no regulations implementing EKRA proposed by the Department of Justice.
​
The Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the FDA, and state regulators, such as state boards of pharmacy, regulate drug and controlled substance packaging, repackaging, purchasing, handling, storage, distribution, security, and dispensing activities. Our prescription fulfillment pharmacies must comply with the applicable FDA, DEA, and state statutes, regulations, and policies. In addition, our prescription fulfillment pharmacies may be subject to periodic audits by the FDA, the DEA, and state regulators to assess our compliance with these requirements. 
​
Noncompliance with applicable federal or state requirements, as described above, can result in an enforcement action that could substantially harm our business.
​
Anti-Kickback Laws
​
The federal AKS makes it unlawful for individuals or entities, among other things, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive, or pay any kickback, bribe, or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce or reward the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, or the purchase, lease, or order, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering, of any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
​

The AKS is applicable to us as operators of specialty pharmacies, contractors to health plans and providers, and contractors to various federal healthcare program payers. When our compensation arrangements implicate the AKS, we evaluate whether we believe they fall within one of the safe harbors. If not, we consider the factors to identify the intent behind such arrangements and the relative risk of fraud and abuse. We also design business models that seek to reduce the risk that any such arrangements might be viewed as abusive and trigger AKS scrutiny or claims.
​
In addition to the federal AKS, many states have anti-kickback prohibitions that may apply to arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers.
​
Federal and State Self-Referral Laws
​
The Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing designated health services, or DHS, from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is violated if the financial arrangement does not meet an applicable exception, regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral.
​
We evaluate when these physician (or immediate family member) financial arrangements are created to ensure we do not enter into a prohibited financial relationship and design structures that satisfy exceptions under the Stark Law.
​
Our business may implicate federal and state physician self-referral laws to the extent our pharmacy, a designated health services entity, has financial arrangements in the form of ownership, investment, or compensation with referring physicians or a referring physician’s immediate family member. Our pharmacy may have compensation arrangements with physicians who serve on its Clinical Advisory Panel and who order designated health services for patients enrolled in a PACE program. If any such compensation arrangements exist, we believe such compensation arrangements fall within an exception to the physician self-referral prohibition.
​
A number of states have statutes and regulations that prohibit the same general types of conduct as those prohibited by the Stark Law, but some have even broader applications, extending beyond Medicare and Medicaid programs and including commercial and self-payers.
​
Federal and State False Claims Acts
​
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil liability on individuals and entities that, among other things, knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid. The civil False Claims Act provides for treble damages and mandatory and significant minimum penalties per false claim or statement ($13,507 to $27,018 per false claim). The qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the civil False Claims Act permit a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. Our future activities relating to the manner in which we sell and market our services may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. False Claims Act qui tam lawsuits in healthcare are common, although the government often declines to pursue such actions following investigation. Analogous state false claims laws also may apply to our sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers.
​
Other State Laws
​
The vast majority of, if not all, states have laws regulating licensure, registration and certification of pharmacies, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, other pharmacy personnel, and health insurance administrators. We are licensed in all states that require such licensure in which we do business and believe that we substantially comply with all state licensing laws applicable to our business. Where required by law, we also have pharmacists licensed in all states in which we dispense. If we violate state pharmacy licensure laws or engage in conduct prohibited under our license, we could be subject to enforcement action, including but not limited to, suspension or loss of such pharmacy license.
​

17




The DEA, as well as some similar state agencies, requires our pharmacy locations to individually register in order to handle controlled substances, including prescription pharmaceuticals. Federal and various state laws also regulate specific labeling, reporting, and record-keeping related to controlled substances. We maintain DEA registrations for each of our facilities that require such registration and follow procedures intended to comply with all applicable federal and state requirements regarding dispensing controlled substances.
​
Human Capital
​
Our success is built upon our dedicated and passionate employees who strive to transform the communities we serve by delivering excellent service, utilizing advanced technology, and delivering results. We believe that our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We are focused on recruiting a diverse talent pool, promoting leadership development and performance management, and maintaining positive relations with our employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,027 employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements and substantially all of our employees currently work in the United States. We believe that we have been successful to date in attracting skilled and experienced professionals.
​
Diversity & Inclusion
​
We continue to focus on building a high performing organization with an engaging work culture and have established initiatives to support this strategic priority. We embrace differences, diversity, and varying perspectives among our employee base, and we are an equal opportunity employer. We have a zero-tolerance policy regarding any type of harassment and discrimination. We believe in respecting every employee and expect our staff to show respect for everyone.
​
We believe that our company culture relies on collaboration and input from multiple perspectives. We also believe that building upon our diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives is key to engaging in responsible business practices. Our DEI committee provides training for all of our employees, and we offer employee resource groups. As of December 31, 2022, 68% of our employees and 56% of our managers self-identified as female. Moreover, as of December 31, 2022, 55% of our Board self-identified as diverse.
​
Employee Engagement
​
We strongly believe that our success depends, in part, on open and regular communication with employees to help foster a high-performing and engaged workforce. We use a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication to help ensure that employees fully understand the Company’s long-term strategy, annual goals, and how their work contributes to the Company’s success.
