Segments Overview
 Material Handling Segment
 The Material Handling Segment manufactures highly engineered polymer packaging containers, storage and safety products, and specialty molded parts. The brands within this segment include Buckhorn®, Akro-Mils®, Jamco®, Ameri-Kart®, Elkhart Plastics™ and Scepter®.
 Buckhorn’s reusable containers and pallets are used in closed-loop supply chain systems to help customers improve product protection, increase handling efficiencies, reduce freight costs and eliminate solid waste and disposal costs.  Buckhorn offers products to replace costly single use cardboard boxes, wooden pallets, and steel containers. The product line is among the broadest in the industry and includes injection-molded and structural foam-molded constructions.  Buckhorn’s product lines include hand-held containers used for inventory control, order management and transportation of retail goods; collapsible and fixed-wall bulk transport containers for light and heavy-duty tasks; intermediate bulk containers for the storage and transport of food, liquid, powder, and granular products; plastic pallets; and specialty boxes designed for storage of items such as seed. Buckhorn also produces a wide variety of specialty products for niche applications and custom products designed according to exact customer specifications.
 Akro-Mils material handling products provide customers everything they need to store, organize and transport a wide range of goods while increasing overall productivity and profitability.  Serving industrial, commercial and consumer markets, Akro-Mils products range from AkroBins® — the industry’s leading small parts bins — to Super-Size AkroBins, metal panel and bin hanging systems, metal storage cabinet and bin systems, wire shelving systems, plastic and metal transport carts and a wide variety of custom storage and transport products. Akro-Mils products deliver storage and organization solutions in a wide variety of applications, from creating assembly line workstations to organizing medical supplies and retail displays. Emphasis is placed on product bundling and customizing systems to create specific storage and organization configurations for customers’ operations. 
 Jamco Products is well established in industrial and commercial markets with its wide selection of welded steel service carts, platform trucks, mobile work centers, racks and cabinets for plastic bins, safety cabinets, medical cylinder carts and more. Jamco Products’ quality product offering, relationships with industrial distributors and reputation for quality and service complements Myers Industries’ other Material Handling businesses.
 Ameri-Kart is an industry leading manufacturer and thermoformer of rotational-molded water, fuel and waste handling tanks, plastic trim and interior parts used in the production of seat components, consoles, and other applications throughout the recreational vehicle, marine, and industrial markets.  In addition to standard marine parts, Ameri-Kart is well respected within the marine market for its patented Enviro-Fill® overfill prevention system (“OPS”) technology and is the industry’s only turnkey provider of an integrated, Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)-compliant marine fuel tank and patented Enviro-Fill diurnal system. 
 Elkhart Plastics, which was acquired in November 2020,  is another industry leading manufacturer of rotational-molded water, fuel and waste handling tanks, plastic trim and parts used in recreational vehicle, marine, agriculture, commercial construction equipment, heavy truck equipment, material handling and more.  Custom plastics are manufactured in lengths up to 160 inches in a variety of shapes and thicknesses.
 Scepter is a leading producer of portable plastic fuel containers, portable marine fuel tanks and water containers, ammunition containers and storage totes.  Scepter was the first provider of Jerry Cans to North America which offer safe, reliable transportation and storage of fuel for the consumer market.  Scepter also manufactures a variety of blow molded products for military applications from high quality containers to safely store and transport large caliber ammunition, to military specified portable fuel and water canisters. Scepter's in-house product engineering and state of the art mold capabilities complements Myers Industries’ Material Handling Segment through an increased product offering and global reach.
 Distribution Segment
 The Distribution Segment includes the Myers Tire Supply®, Myers Tire Supply International, Tuffy Manufacturing and Patch Rubber Company® brands.  Within the Distribution Segment the Company sources and manufactures top of the line products for the tire, wheel and undervehicle service industry.
 Myers Tire Supply is the largest U.S. distributor and single source for tire, wheel and undervehicle service tools, equipment and supplies. The Company buys and sells over 10,000 unique items — everything that professionals need to service passenger, truck and off-road tires, wheels and related components. Independent tire dealers, mass merchandisers, commercial auto and truck fleets, auto dealerships, tire retreaders and general repair facilities rely on our broad product selection, rapid availability and personal service to be more productive and profitably grow their businesses. Myers Tire Supply International further distributes these product offerings in Central America, through its branch offices, and to other foreign countries, through its U.S. export business.

While the needs and composition of our distribution markets constantly change, we adapt and deliver new products and services that are crucial to our customers’ success. The new product pipeline is driven by a thorough understanding of the market and its customers’ needs. Myers Tire Supply in turn works closely with its suppliers to develop innovative products and services to meet these needs.
 Patch Rubber Company manufactures one of the most comprehensive lines of tire repair and retreading products in the United States. Service professionals rely on our extensive product selection and quality for safe, cost-effective repairs to passenger, truck and off-road tires. Products include the plug that fills a puncture, the cement that seals the plug, the tire innerliner patch and the final sealing compound. Patch brand repair products maintain a strong position in the tire service markets including sales through the Myers Tire Supply sales network.  Patch Rubber also employs its rubber calendering and compounding expertise to create a diverse portfolio of products outside of the tire repair market, such as permanent and temporary reflective highway marking tape. Our rubber-based tape and symbols provide the durability and brightness that construction professionals demand to replace paint for marking road repair, intersections and hazardous areas.
 Raw Materials & Suppliers 
 The Company purchases substantially all of its raw materials from a wide range of third-party suppliers. These materials are primarily polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene plastic resins, all used within the Material Handling Segment, as well as synthetic and natural rubber. Most raw materials are commodity products and are available from several domestic suppliers. We believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our business, although there are limited suppliers of certain grades of plastic resins, where the market supply can be temporarily disrupted by an unanticipated loss of capacity from any one such supplier.
 Our Distribution Segment purchases substantially all of its components from third-party suppliers and has multiple sources for its products.
 Competition
 Competition in our Material Handling Segment is substantial and varied in form and size from manufacturers of similar products to those of other products which can be substituted for products produced by the Company. In general, most direct competitors with the Company’s brands are private entities. Myers Industries maintains strong brand presence and market positions in the niche sectors of the markets it serves. The Company does not command substantial, overall market presence in the broad market sectors.
 Competition in our Distribution Segment is generally comprised of small companies, regional players and national auto parts chains where product offerings may overlap. Within the overall tire, wheel and undervehicle service market, Myers Industries is the largest U.S. distributor of tools, equipment and supplies offered based on national coverage.
 Customer Dependence
 In 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no customers that accounted for more than ten percent of total net sales from continuing operations. Myers Industries serves thousands of customers who demand value through product selection, innovation, quality, delivery and responsive personal service. Our brands foster satisfied, loyal customers who have recognized our performance through numerous supplier quality awards.
Human Capital Management
 Myers employees are located throughout North and Central America. Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. The Company employed approximately 2,400 people globally in both a full-time and part-time capacity as of December 31, 2020. Of these, approximately 1,900 were employed in the Company’s Material Handling Segment while the Distribution Segment employed approximately 450. The Company’s corporate offices had approximately 50 employees. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 140 employees represented by a labor union. The collective bargaining agreement between us and the labor union expires June 2022. The Myers employee base provides the foundation for our Company’s success.
 Our employees are responsible for upholding our core values, which include but are not limited to working safely and collaboratively, conducting all aspects of business with the highest standards of integrity, leveraging processes and procedures to drive continuous improvement, empowering individuals and teams across the Company, embracing change as we embark on our One Myers strategic vision, attracting and developing diverse talent, and demonstrating servant leadership to drive improvements in the communities where we live and operate.

Health and Safety
 One core value of the Company is the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. The Company has developed a health and safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs to ensure all employees can expect workplace safety. The Company’s health and safety strategies are consistently reviewed and updated as changes occur and key metrics are discussed in our Corporate Safety Committee meetings.  The results of these critical safety statistics and metrics are distributed internally. Safety awareness and employee engagement programs have been implemented at the Company’s facilities and are a critical consideration in our town hall meetings.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. Our health and safety focus is evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and includes the following:
  
• | adding work from home flexibility;
--+-----------------------------------


• | encouraging those who are sick or have symptoms to stay home;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing cleaning protocols across all locations;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | regular communications regarding health and safety protocols and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishing physical distancing and personal protective equipment procedures for employees;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing masks and cleaning supplies;
--+---------------------------------------


• | implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prohibiting all domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We manufacture products which are deemed essential to the critical infrastructure and all production sites have continued operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we have invested in creating physically safe work environments for our employees.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 As part of our human capital management initiatives, we are continuing to develop and improve our internal reporting on key talent metrics, including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, and diversity hiring analytics. These initiatives align with our goal of creating a positive and dynamic workplace where all employees can flourish. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a broad range of backgrounds and experiences. 
Talent Development
 Successful execution of the Company's strategy depends on attracting and retaining highly qualified individuals. The Company believes it is important to reward associates with competitive wages and benefits to recognize professional excellence and career progression. The Company also believes it is important to provide pay and benefits that are competitive and equitable based on its local markets.
 The Company believes that having open, honest dialogue with its employees is a key tenet in evolving its culture and keeping it thriving. As a function of this approach, the Company conducts surveys on a periodic basis to measure and report employee engagement and areas of concern. The Company also provides professional development and training opportunities to advance the skills and expertise of Myers’ employees.
 Backlog
 The backlog of orders for our operations is estimated to have been approximately $39 million at December 31, 2020 and approximately $23 million at December 31, 2019. Generally, our lead time between customer order and product delivery is less than 90 days, and thus our estimated backlog is substantially expected to be delivered within the succeeding three months. During periods of shorter lead times, backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future sales. Accordingly, we do not believe our backlog data and comparisons thereof, as of different dates, reliably indicate future sales or shipments.
