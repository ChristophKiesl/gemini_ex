ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the name KokiCare, Inc. on April 28, 2015 in the State of Delaware. From inception through the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we were in the discovery and planning phase to develop a real-time, SaaS-based enterprise software application to manage the integration, planning, tracking and management of healthcare assets, which include, people, supplies, clinical data, relationships, and financial resources of healthcare organizations.
 
Unless otherwise noted, all references to the “Company”, “KokiCare”, “we”, “us” or “our” refer to KokiCare Inc. prior to consummation of the Merger (as defined below).
 
As a result of not materially beginning our operations as of December 31, 2016, from inception through December 31, 2016, we were a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). As a shell company, we did not have material operations and had assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. 
 
The Merger and Reverse Acquisition
 
On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which, as amended, we refer to as the Merger Agreement, together with Red Maple Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of KokiCare, Inc., referred tdo as Merger Sub, and Advanced Inhalation Therapies (AIT) Ltd. which we refer to as AIT Ltd.

The Israeli Merger became effective on December 29, 2016 and the Merger closed on January 13, 2017.
 
Prior to consummation of the Merger, effective as of January 9, 2017, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation, which we refer to as the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to (i) change its name from “KokiCare, Inc.” to “AIT Therapeutics, Inc.”, (ii) increase its capitalization to provide for the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of its common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share; and (iii) effect a one-for-100 reverse stock split of the common stock. On January 9, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $2.50 per share cash dividend to its stockholders of record as of January 9, 2017, and the Company repurchased 90,000 shares of its common stock (on a post-reverse stock split basis) at a price of $0.2667 per share from its principal stockholder, Jason Lane.
 
The Merger is being accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization. AIT Ltd. is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and the Company is the acquired company.
