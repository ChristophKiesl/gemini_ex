Item 1. Business.
General Development of the Business.
UFP Industries, Inc. (“we” or “our”) is a holding company with subsidiaries throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia that supply products primarily manufactured from wood, wood and non-wood composites, and other materials to three markets: retail, industrial, and construction. We are headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan. For more information about UFP Industries, Inc., or our affiliated operations, go to www.ufpi.com.
Information relating to current developments in our business is incorporated by reference from our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 ("2020 Annual Report") under the caption "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."  Selected portions of the 2020 Annual Report are filed as Exhibit 13 with this Form 10-K Report.
Financial Information About Segments.
ASC 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”) defines operating segments as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Effective January 1, 2020, we re-organized around the markets we serve rather than geography. Our new business segments align with the following markets: UFP Retail Solutions, UFP Construction and UFP Industrial. Among other things, this change allows for a more specialized and consistent sales approach among Company operations, more efficient use of resources and capital, and quicker introduction of new products and services. We manage the operations of our individual locations primarily through a market-centered reporting structure under which each location is included in a business unit and business units are included in our Retail, Industrial, and Construction segments. The exception to this market-centered reporting and management structure is the Company’s International segment, which comprises our Mexico, Canada, and Australia operations and sales and buying offices in other parts of the world. Our International segment and Ardellis (our insurance captive) are referred to as “All Other” throughout this report. The Corporate segment includes purchasing, transportation and administrative functions that serve our operating segments. Operating results of Corporate primarily consists of over (under) allocated costs, the operating results of UFP Real Estate, Inc., which owns and leases real estate, and UFP Transportation Ltd., which owns and leases transportation equipment.
Narrative Description of Business.
We design, manufacture and market wood and wood-alternative products for national home centers and other retailers; structural lumber, engineered components, and other products for the manufactured housing industry and for residential and commercial construction; specialty wood packaging, protective packaging, and components for various industries; and customized interior fixtures used in a variety of retail and commercial structures. Each of our segments, Retail, Industrial and Construction, are discussed in the paragraphs that follow. 
Retail segment. The customers comprising this segment are national home center retailers, retail-oriented regional lumberyards and contractor-oriented lumberyards. Generally, terms of sale are established for annual or bi-annual periods, and orders are placed with our regional facilities in accordance with established terms. One customer, The Home Depot, accounted for approximately 24% of our total net sales in fiscal 2020 and 19% in 2019 and 2018.
We currently supply customers in this segment from many of our locations. These regional facilities are able to supply mixed truckloads of products which can be delivered to customers with rapid turnaround from receipt of an order. Freight costs are a factor in the ability to competitively service this market, especially with treated wood products because of their heavier weight. The close proximity of our regional facilities to the various outlets of these customers is a factor when negotiating annual sales programs.

The products offered to customers in this segment include dimensional lumber (both preserved and unpreserved) and various "value-added products," some of which are sold under our trademarks. In addition to our conventional lumber products, we offer a large portfolio of outdoor living products, including wood and wood composite decking and related accessories and decorative lawn and garden products. Products sold to this segment include those sold under the following trademarks: ProWood, Deckorators, UFP-Edge, Outdoor Essentials, Dimensions, and ProWood FR. These product categories also comprise the business units within our retail segment.
We are not aware of any competitor that currently manufactures, treats and distributes a full line of both value-added and commodity-based products on a national basis as we do within our retail segment. We face competition on individual products from several different producers, but the majority of these competitors tend to be regional in their efforts and/or do not offer a full line of outdoor lumber products. We believe the breadth of our product offering, geographic dispersion, close proximity of our plants to core customers, purchasing and manufacturing expertise, and service capabilities provide competitive advantages in this market.
Industrial segment. We define our industrial segment as manufacturers and agricultural customers who use pallets, specialty crates, wooden boxes, and other containers used for packaging, shipping and material handling purposes, as well as various other products, including protective packaging, used in a variety of different applications. Many of the wood-based products sold to this market may be produced from the wood by-product of other manufactured products, thereby allowing us to increase our raw material yields while expanding our business. Competition is fragmented and includes virtually every supplier of lumber convenient to the customer. We service this segment with our dedicated local sales teams and through national sales support efforts.
Construction segment. Our construction segment is made up of customers in four markets – factory-built housing, site-built residential construction, concrete forming, and commercial construction, which represent the business units of our construction segment.
The customers comprising the factory-built housing market are producers of mobile, modular and prefabricated homes and recreational vehicles (RV). Products sold to customers in this market consist primarily of roof trusses, lumber cut and shaped to the customer’s specification, plywood, oriented strand board and dimensional lumber, all intended for use in the construction of manufactured housing. Sales are made by personnel located at each regional facility based on customer orders. Our principal competitive advantages include our product knowledge, the strength of our engineering support services, the close proximity of our regional facilities to our customers, our purchasing and manufacturing expertise and our ability to provide national sales programs to certain customers. We also distribute products such as siding, electrical and plumbing products to factory-built housing and RV customers.
The customers comprising the site-built residential construction market are primarily large-volume, multi-tract builders and smaller volume custom builders. We also supply builders engaged in multi-family and light commercial construction. Competition in this market is primarily fragmented, but we do compete with a small number of national and regional retail contractor yards who also manufacture components and provide framing services, as well as regional manufacturers of components. We believe our primary competitive advantages relate to the engineering and design capabilities of our regional staff, purchasing and manufacturing expertise, product quality, timeliness of delivery, and financial strength. We believe that providing a comprehensive turn-key package, including installation, provides a competitive advantage. Generally, terms of sale and pricing are determined based on contracts we entered into with our customers. We currently supply customers in these markets from manufacturing facilities located in many different states. These facilities manufacture various engineered wood components used to frame residential or light commercial projects, including roof and floor trusses, wall panels, I-joists and lumber packages. Freight costs are a factor in the ability to competitively service this market due to the space requirements of these products on each truckload. We also provide framing services for builders in certain regional markets, in which we erect the wood structure. 
Our commercial business unit primarily includes the operations of idX Holdings, Inc. ("idX"). idX is a designer, manufacturer and installer of highly customized interior fixtures, casework and millwork used in a variety of retail and commercial structures representing several end markets.

Finally, we supply wood forms and related products to set or form concrete for various structures, including large parking garages, stadiums and bridges, to our concrete forming customers.
Suppliers. We are one of the largest domestic buyers of solid sawn softwood lumber from primary producers (lumber mills). We use primarily southern yellow pine in our pressure-treating operations and site-built component plants in the Southeastern United States, which we obtain from mills located throughout the states comprising the Sunbelt. Other species we use include "spruce-pine-fir" from various provinces in Canada; hemlock, douglas fir and cedar from the Pacific Northwest; inland species of pine, plantation grown radiata and southern yellow pines from South America; and European spruce. Our annual purchases of lumber are approximately $2.0 billion and consist of the following species and their respective percent of total lumber purchases: southern yellow pine (62%), spruce-pine-fir (18%), and douglas fir (3%), while the remaining 17% of lumber purchases comprise various other species and imports outside of North America. Additionally, we purchase approximately $0.5 billion in plywood on an annual basis. There are numerous primary producers for all varieties we use, and we are not dependent on any particular source of supply. Our financial resources and size, in combination with our strong sales network and ability to remanufacture lumber, enable us to purchase a large percentage of a primary producer’s output (as opposed to only those dimensions or grades in immediate need), thereby lowering our average cost of raw materials and allowing us to obtain favorable programs such as consigned inventory. We believe this represents a competitive advantage.
Intellectual Property. We own several patents and have several patents pending on technologies related to our business. In addition, we own numerous registered trademarks and claim common law trademark rights to several others. As we develop proprietary brands, we may pursue registration or other formal protection. While we believe our patent and trademark rights are valuable, the loss of a patent or any trademark would not be likely to have a material adverse impact on our competitive position.
Backlog. Due to the nature of our retail and industrial businesses, backlog information is not meaningful. The maximum time between receipt of a firm order and shipment does not usually exceed a few days. Therefore, we would not normally have a backlog of unfilled orders in a material amount. The relationships with our major customers are such that we are either the exclusive supplier of certain products and/or certain geographic areas, or the designated source for a specified portion of the customer’s requirements. In such cases, either we are able to forecast the customer’s requirements, or the customer may provide an estimate of its future needs. In neither case, however, will we receive firm orders until just prior to the anticipated delivery dates for the products in question.
On December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, we estimate that backlog orders associated with our customized interior fixture businesses approximated $65.2 million and $75.0 million, respectively. With respect to the former, we expect that these orders will be primarily filled within the next fiscal year; however, it is possible that some orders could be canceled.
On December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, we estimate that backlog orders associated with our construction businesses approximated $106.0 million and $110.1 million, respectively. With respect to the former, we expect that these orders will be primarily filled within the next fiscal year; however, it is possible that some orders could be canceled.
Environmental. Information required for environmental disclosures is incorporated by reference from Note L of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 herein.
Seasonality. Information required for seasonality disclosures is incorporated by reference from Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption “Seasonality and weather conditions could adversely affect us.”
Employees. On December 26, 2020, we had approximately 12,000 employees. For over 65 years, the success of our company has rested on the skill, motivation and performance of our employees. We treat our people honestly and fairly, creating career paths and training opportunities to develop and expand their scope of responsibilities and financial rewards. This approach to human capital, which is embedded in the Company's culture, has fostered an environment where our employees often commit their respective careers to UFP Industries, Inc.
