Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read together and in connection with the other reports that have been filed by us with the SEC for a comprehensive description of our financial condition and operating results. In the interest of disclosure, we have included in this Form 10-K certain material events and developments that have taken place through the date of filing of this Form 10-K with the SEC.
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, INVO Bioscience, Inc. (INVO Bioscience, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this document as “we”, “us”, “INVO Bioscience”, “INVO,” or the “Company”), incorporates by reference certain information from parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission allows us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to all such information when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All information is as of December 31, 2020 unless otherwise indicated. For a description of the risk factors affecting or applicable to our business, see “Risk Factors,” below.
 
The Company
 
We are a medical device company focused on the Assisted Reproductive Technology (“ART”) marketplace. Our mission is to increase access to care and expand fertility treatment and patient care across the globe. Our patented device, the INVOcell, is the first Intravaginal Culture (“IVC”) system in the world used for the in vivo incubation of eggs and sperm during fertilization and early embryo development. INVOcell was granted clearance in the United States by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) in November 2015, received the CE mark in October 2019, and is now positioned to help provide millions of infertile couples across the globe access to a new infertility treatment option. We believe this novel device and procedure (the “INVO Procedure”) provides a more natural, safe, effective, efficient and economical fertility treatment compared to current infertility treatments, including in-vitro fertilization (“IVF”) and intrauterine insemination (“IUI”). Unlike conventional infertility treatments such as IVF where the eggs and sperm develop into embryos in a laboratory incubator, the INVOcell utilizes the women’s vaginal cavity as the incubator to support a more natural fertilization process. As such, this novel device promotes in vivo conception and early embryo development.
 
In both commercial utilization of INVOcell and in clinical studies, the INVO Procedure has proven to have equivalent pregnancy success and live birth rates as IVF. Additionally, we believe there are emotional benefits with the mother’s participation in fertilization and early embryo development by vaginal incubation compared to that of conventional IVF treatment by offering a more connected and personalized method to achieve pregnancy.
 
For many couples struggling with infertility, access to treatment is often unavailable. Financial challenges (i.e., cost of treatment) and limited availability (or capacity) of fertility medical care are two of the main challenges in the ART marketplace that contribute to a large percentage of untreated patients. Religious, social and cultural roadblocks can also prevent hopeful couples from realizing their dream to have a baby with conventional IVF. We believe INVOcell can address many of the key challenges in the ART market, particularly patient cost and infrastructure capacity constraints. The many benefits to the INVO Solution include:
 

● | Cost: Many current clinics offering INVOcell are doing so at approximately half the cost of IVF treatment, due to less drugs often being prescribed for INVOcell, fewer office visits needed, and less laboratory time needed as incubation is occurring inside the body rather than the lab incubator. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enhanced patient capacity: The INVOcell device eliminates the need for a lab incubator as well as helps reduce the overall need for lab-support resources during the incubation period. We believe this generally supports the ability to lower costs as well as enable a clinic to handle a higher volume of patients on average. 
● | Promotes greater involvement by couples in the treatment and conception. 
● | Reduces the risk of errors of wrong embryo transfers since the embryos are never separated from the woman. 
● | Creates a more natural and environmentally stable incubation than conventional IVF incubation in a laboratory. 

 
In the second quarter of 2016, the first U.S. baby from the INVOcell and INVO Procedure following FDA clearance was born in Texas.
 
Company History
 
We were formed on January 5, 2007 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts under the name Bio X Cell, Inc. to acquire the assets of Medelle Corporation (“Medelle”). Dr. Claude Ranoux purchased all of the assets of Medelle, and then he contributed those assets, including four patents relating to the INVOcell technology, to Bio X Cell, Inc. upon its formation in January 2007.

On December 5, 2008, Bio X Cell, Inc., doing business as INVO Bioscience, and each of the shareholders of INVO Bioscience entered into a share exchange agreement and consummated a share exchange with Emy’s Salsa AJI Distribution Company, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Emy’s”). Upon the closing of the share exchange on December 5, 2008, the INVO Bioscience shareholders transferred all of their shares of common stock in INVO Bioscience to Emy’s. In connection with the share exchange, Emy’s changed its name to INVO Bioscience, Inc. and Bio X Cell, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Emy’s (re-named INVO Bioscience, Inc.).
 
On November 2, 2015 we were notified by the United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) that the INVOcell and INVO Procedure were granted clearance via the de novo classification (as a Class II device) allowing us to market the INVOcell in the United States. Following this approval, we began marketing and selling INVOcell in many locations across the U.S. We currently have approximately 140 trained clinics or satellite facilities in the U.S. where patients can receive guidance and treatment for the INVO Procedure.
 
On November 12, 2018, we entered into a U.S. Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Ferring International Center S.A. (“Ferring”), which closed on January 14, 2019. At the closing, we received a $5,000,000 license payment upfront from Ferring. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, among other things, we granted Ferring an exclusive license in the United States market only, with rights to sublicense under patents related to our proprietary intravaginal culture device (INVOcell™), together with the retention device and any other applicable accessories (collectively, the “Licensed Product”) to market, promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Product with respect to all therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic uses of medical devices or pharmaceutical products involving reproductive technology (including infertility treatment) in humans (the “Field”). Ferring is responsible, at its own cost, for all commercialization activities for the Licensed Product in the U.S. market. We retained a limited exception to the exclusive license granted to Ferring allowing us, subject to certain restrictions, to establish up to five clinics that will commercialize INVO cycles in the U.S. This agreement was amended on March 2, 2021 to provide for added flexibility by increasing the number of INVO company-owned clinics initially allowable under the agreement and removing certain geographical requirements. Ferring is obligated to make a second payment to us of $3,000,000 upon procurement of a five (5) day label enhancement from the FDA for the current incubation period for the Licensed Product at least three (3) years prior to the expiration of the term of the license for the Licensed Product and provided further that Ferring has not previously exercised its right to terminate the Distribution Agreement for convenience. In addition, under the terms of a separate Supply Agreement, Ferring is obligated to pay us a specified supply price for each Licensed Product purchased by Ferring for distribution. The Distribution Agreement has an initial term expiring on December 31, 2025 and at the end of the initial term it may be terminated by us if Ferring fails to generate specified minimum revenues to us from the sale of the Licensed Product during the final two years of the initial term. Provided that no such termination occurs at the end of the initial term, thereafter the term of the Distribution Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive three (3) years terms unless terminated by mutual consent. We retain all commercialization rights for the Licensed Product outside of the United States. See “Amendment to Ferring Distribution Agreement” below regarding Amendment No. 1 to the Distribution Agreement.
 
In October 2019, we received notice that the INVOcell product received CE Marking. The CE marking (also known as CE mark) is a mandatory conformity mark on many products placed on the single market in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The CE marking (an acronym for the French “Conformite Europeenne”) certifies that a product has met European Union (“EU”) health, safety and environmental requirements, which ensure consumer safety. It permits us to now commercially distribute INVOcell throughout various countries in the EU provided we comply with local registration requirements that vary by country. We had previously obtained the CE Mark in May 2008, but due to limited resources during that time we let the prior CE Mark lapse. With the re-certification completed, we are now actively marketing INVOcell within the EU.

Private Placement
 
From May 15, 2020 through July 1, 2020, we entered into definitive securities purchase agreements (“Purchase Agreements”) with accredited investors for their purchase of (i) secured convertible notes issued by us in the aggregate original principal amount of $3,494,840 (the “Notes”), and (ii) Unit Purchase Options (“Purchase Options”) to purchase 303,623 units (each, a “Unit”), at an exercise price of $3.20 per Unit (subject to adjustments), with each Unit exercisable for (A) one share of our common stock and (B) a 5-year warrant (the “Warrants”) to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 (subject to adjustments) (the “Private Placement”). Each purchaser of a Note was issued a 5-year Purchase Option to purchase 0.086875 Units (as adjusted for the Reverse Splits (as defined below) for each dollar of Notes purchased. We received gross proceeds of approximately $3.5 million (of which $3,351,200 was received in cash and $143,640 resulted from cancellation of indebtedness). Tribal Capital Markets, LLC acted as placement agent (the “Placement Agent”) in the Private Placement. We paid the Placement Agent and certain selling agents a cash fee of 8% on a portion of the proceeds for an aggregate amount of $236,000. We also agreed to issue the Placement Agent and the selling agent 5-year warrants to purchase 6,750 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.20. These warrants have the same terms and conditions as the Warrants issued in the Private Placement, except for the different exercise price. We received approximately $2,998,905 in net proceeds from the Private Placement, after deducting Placement Agent fees and selling agent fees payable to the Placement Agent and selling agent, respectively, and investor counsel in connection with the transaction. We used approximately $413,456 in proceeds to repay outstanding 9% promissory notes and we intend to use the remaining proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 
Pursuant to that certain Form of Secured Convertible Note entered into in connection with the Purchase Agreement (the “Form of Note”), interest on such Notes accrues at a rates of ten percent (10%) per annum and is payable either in cash or in shares of our common stock at conversion price of $3.20 (following and subject to adjustment for stock splits, combinations or similar events and anti-dilution provisions, among other adjustments) on each of the six and twelve month anniversary of the issuance date and on the maturity dates of November 15, 2021, December 22, 2021 and December 30, 2021.
 
All amounts of principal and interest due under the Notes are convertible at any time after the issuance date, in whole or in part (subject to rounding for fractional shares), at the option of the holders, into our common stock at a fixed conversion price of $3.20, which is subject to adjustment as described above.
 
Upon any issuance by us of any of our equity securities, including common stock, for cash consideration, indebtedness or a combination thereof after the date hereof (a “Subsequent Equity Financing”), each holder of a Note will have the option to convert the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest of its Note into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock issued in the Subsequent Equity Financing (“Conversion Securities”) equal to the product of unpaid principal, together with the balance of unpaid and accrued interest and other amounts payable hereunder multiplied by 1.1, divided by the price per share paid by the investors for the Conversion Securities.
 
A Note may not be converted, and shares of common stock may not be issued under the Notes if, after giving effect to the conversion or issuance, the holder together with its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of our outstanding ordinary shares.
 
We may prepay the Notes at any time in whole or in part by paying an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest plus a prepayment fee equal to one percent (1%) of the principal amount to be repaid.
 
The Notes contain customary events of default including but not limited to: (i) failure to make payments when due; and (ii) bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. If an event of default occurs, each holder may require us to redeem all or any portion of the Notes (including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon), in cash.
 
The Notes are secured by the proceeds from the $3,000,000 milestone payment pursuant to Section 7.2(b) of the Distribution Agreement dated November 12, 2018 between us and Ferring International Center S.A., after such proceeds are actually received by us from Ferring, all pursuant to the terms of a Security Agreement entered into between us and the noteholders under the Purchase Agreements. As of March 30, 2021, $2,994,840 in Note principal has been converted into common shares.

Reverse Stock Splits
 
On December 16, 2019, our stockholders approved a reverse stock split at a ratio of between 1-for 5 and 1-for-25, with discretion for the exact ratio to be approved by our board of directors. On February 19, 2020, our board of directors approved a reverse stock split of the our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20. On May 21, 2020, we filed a certificate of change (with an effective date of May 26, 2020) with the Nevada Secretary of State pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.209 to effectuate a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. On May 22, 2020, we received notice from FINRA/OTC Corporate Actions that the reverse split would take effect at the open of business on May 26, 2020 and the reverse stock split took effect on that date.
 
On October 22, 2020, our board of directors approved a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of 5-for-8 and also approved a proportionate decrease in our authorized common stock to 125,000,000 shares from 200,000,000. Pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes, a company may effect a reverse split without stockholder approval if both the number of authorized shares of common stock and the number of outstanding shares of common stock are proportionally reduced as a result of the reverse split, the reverse split does not adversely affect any other class of stock of the company, and the company does not pay money or issue scrip to stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the reverse split. On November 5, 2020, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State (with an effective date of November 9, 2020) pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.209 to (i) decrease the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200,000,000 to 125,000,000 shares and (ii) effectuate a 5-for-8 reverse stock split of the outstanding common stock. On November 6, 2020, we received notice from FINRA/OTC Corporate Actions that the reverse split would take effect at the open of business on November 9, 2020 and the reverse stock split took effect on that date.
 
The INVOcell® Technology
 
Our product, the INVOcell®, is the first in vivo Intravaginal Culture (“IVC”) system granted FDA clearance in the United States. This novel device and procedure provide a natural, safe, effective, efficient and economical fertility treatment option for patients. The patented INVOcell device is used for the incubation of eggs and sperm during fertilization and early embryo development. Unlike conventional infertility treatments such as IVF where the eggs and sperm develop into embryos in a laboratory incubator, the INVOcell utilizes the women’s vagina as an incubator to support a more natural fertilization and embryo development environment, and infertility treatment. The device promotes in vivo conception for early embryo development. In clinical studies, the INVO Procedure produced equivalent efficacy, safety and pregnancy rates to conventional IVF treatments.
 
The INVOcell system consists of the following components:
 
The INVOcell Culture Device is used in preparing, holding, and transferring human gametes or embryos during In Vitro Fertilization/Intravaginal Culture and Intra-cytoplasmic Sperm Injection Fertilization/Intravaginal Culture procedures. The INVOcell Culture Device is positioned in the INVOcell Retention Device prior to placement in the patient’s vaginal cavity.
 
The INVOcell Retention Device is used in conjunction with the INVOcell Culture Device to aid in retention of the INVOcell Device in the vaginal cavity during the incubation period. The INVOcell Culture Device is positioned in the INVOcell Retention Device prior to placement in the patient’s vaginal cavity.

During an INVO Procedure, the patient undergoes an ovarian stimulation cycle. Once the eggs are retrieved and sperm is collected, they are placed into the single use INVOcell device. Sperm collection and preparation generally occur before egg retrieval. Culture medium (~1ml) is placed in the inner vessel of the INVOcell. Eggs and a low concentration of motile sperm are placed into the medium and the inner vessel is closed and secured in the protective outer vessel. The INVOcell device is then immediately positioned in the upper vaginal cavity for incubation, where natural fertilization and early development of the embryos take place for a period of 3-5 days. A retention system can be used to maintain the INVOcell system in the vagina during the incubation period. The retention system consists of a diaphragm type device with holes in the membrane to allow natural elimination of vaginal secretions. The INVOcell is designed so that no vaginal fluids penetrate the outer vessel thus ensuring that the inner vessel is not contaminated while allowing the necessary CO2 for fertilization to pass through.
 
After the three (3) to five (5) day incubation period, the patient returns to the physician’s office where the retention system and the INVOcell are removed. The protective outer vessel is discarded and the contents of the inner vessel are placed into a petri plate an embryologist can evaluate the best embryos for transfer. A trained clinician can readily identify the best embryos for transfer. The embryos to be transferred are aspirated into a standard transfer catheter for transfer into the patient’s uterus. The INVO Procedure can be performed in a physician’s office furnished with the necessary equipment.
 
Operations
 
We operate with a core internal team and outsource certain operational functions in order to help accelerate our efforts as well as reduce internal fixed overhead needs and in-house capital equipment requirements. Our most critical management and leadership functions are carried out by our core management team. We have contracted out the manufacturing, packaging/labeling and sterilization of the device to a contract medical manufacturing company that completes final product manufacturing as well as manages the gamma sterilization process at an FDA registered contract sterilization facility.
 
To date, we have completed a series of important steps in the development and manufacturing of the INVOcell:
 

● | Manufacturing: We are ISO 13485:2016 Certified and manage all aspects of production and manufacturing with qualified suppliers. Our key suppliers have been steadfast partners since our company first began and can provide us with virtually an unlimited capability to support our growth objectives, with all manufacturing done in New England.

● | All raw materials utilized for the INVOcell are medical grade and commonly used in medical devices (e.g., medical grade silicone, medical grade plastic). Our principal mold supplier is a well-established company in the molding industry and is ISO 9001 Certified. Our contract manufacturer for the INVOcell is ISO 13485 Certified and FDA registered. 
● | CE Mark: INVO Bioscience received the CE Mark in October 2019. The CE Mark permits the sale of devices in Europe, Australia and other countries that recognize the CE Mark, subject to local registration requirements. 
● | US Marketing Clearance: The safety and efficacy of the INVOcell device has been demonstrated and cleared for marketing and use by the U.S. FDA in November 2015. 
● | Clinical Trials: The Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approved our planned clinical trial to evaluate the modified INVOcell system for effectiveness of achieving fertilization, implantation, embryo development, clinical pregnancy, and live birth after 5-days of continuous vaginal incubation. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, comfort and retention of the INVOcell with the retention device, and demonstrate superiority following 5-day vaginal incubation as compared to the current 3-day vaginal incubation indication. The pivotal trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04246268) is a single arm, multicenter, open label trial at three clinical centers in the United States with each center enrolling 60 patients between the ages of 18 and 37 years old. The providers at each center will conduct the processes of ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval and embryo transfer per the standard protocols for their centers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, patient recruitment at each site was placed on hold. However, as a result of additional retrospective, real-market usage (5-day) data that became available during 2020, we initiated a 510(k) filing utilizing that retrospective data. We intend to continue pursuing the use of the retrospective data to achieve the label expansion and as such we are evaluating the need to separately complete the clinical trial.

Market Opportunity
 
The global Assisted Reproductive Technology (“ART”) marketplace is a large, multi-billion industry growing at a strong pace in many parts of the world as increased infertility rates increased patient awareness, acceptance of treatment options, and improving financial incentives (insurance etc.) continues to drive demand. Additionally, the market remains vastly underserved as a very high percentage of patients (worldwide) in need of care continue to go untreated each year. The industry also remains capacity constrained thereby creating challenges in providing access to care to the volume of patients in need. According to the European Society for Human Reproduction (“ESHRE”) 2018 ART Fact Sheet, there were more than 150 million infertile couples in the world. While there have been large increases in the use of in-vitro fertilization (“IVF”), only ~2.5 million ART cycles, including IVF, intra uterine insemination (“IUI”) and other fertility treatments, are now performed globally each year, producing around ~550,000 babies. This amounts to less than 3% of the infertile couples worldwide being treated and only 1% having a child though IVF. A survey by “Resolve: The National Infertility Association,” indicates the two main reasons couples do not use IVF is cost and geographical availability (and/or capacity).
 
In the United States infertility according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (“ASRM”) (2017) affects an estimated 10%-15% of the couples of childbearing age. According to the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”), there are approximately 6.7 million women with impaired fertility. Based on preliminary 2018 data from CDC’s National ART Surveillance System, approximately 306,000 IVF cycles were performed at 456 IVF centers, leaving the U.S. with a large, underserved patient market, similar to most other markets around the world.
 
Although the use of IVF is still relatively rare, as compared to demand, its use has doubled over the past decade. Today approximately 1.7% of the infants born in the United States every year are conceived through IVF.
 
IVF has long been, and continues to be, a standard (and effective) treatment option for many infertile couples. At the same time, the industry remains capacity constrained as there are a limited number of IVF clinics (e.g., a limited number of doctors, embryologists, lab incubators, lab space, etc.), which tend to be concentrated in higher population areas all of which helps contribute to keeping the cost of service and access to care out of reach for many in need. Our patented and proven INVOcell technology is a unique, effective, efficient and low cost fertility treatment that offers a more natural option compared to IVF. The procedure can also be provided without a more expensive IVF center and therefore can potentially be available in many more locations. Thus, we believe we are well positioned to capture a significant share of this unmet market and help open up access to care to those millions of infertile couples that go untreated each year.
 
We believe our Distribution Agreement with Ferring provides a significant opportunity to accelerate our goal of expanding INVOcell’s usage and help to solve the industry’s key challenges by providing access to care to a greater number of patients by lowering costs and alleviating capacity constraints while also delivering a treatment option with equivalent success rates to existing solutions. Ferring is a visionary, privately held biopharmaceutical company recognized around the world and a leader in women’s healthcare. Its mission is to help patients live better lives by researching, developing, manufacturing and marketing the most effective and innovative products in reproductive health, women’s health, urology, gastroenterology, endocrinology and orthopedics. Ferring makes their products available in over 100 nations with more than 5,000 employees’ worldwide. They have R&D facilities doing groundbreaking work in Denmark, Israel, Switzerland, China, India, Scotland and the U.S.A. To support the INVOcell initiative Ferring has a new U.S. Operations Center, on a sprawling 25-acre campus in Parsippany, NJ, which includes a state-of-the-art manufacturing suite, next-generation product development laboratories and a fully equipped education and training center.
 
Competition
 
The infertility industry is highly competitive and characterized by long-standing well entrenched procedures as well as technological improvements. The first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born in 1977, making the IVF treatment over 40 years old. Our INVOcell device represents the first new advanced treatment alternative in 40+ years. The market for fertility treatment and devices is highly competitive in terms of pricing, functionality and service quality, the timing of development and introduction of new products and services and terms of financing. We face competition from all ART practitioners and device manufacturers. To date, most advancements in the ART market have been limited to incremental improvements to the various products designed to simply support conventional IVF. Our competitors may implement new technologies before we do, allowing them to offer more attractively priced or enhanced products, services or solutions. Our competitors may have greater resources in certain business segments or geographic markets than we have. We may also encounter increased competition from new market entrants or alternative ART technologies.

Competition in the area of infertility and ART services is also largely based on pregnancy rates and patient outcomes. Accordingly, the ability of our business to compete is largely dependent on our ability to achieve adequate pregnancy rates and patient satisfaction levels. The INVO Procedure offers an alternative treatment option to couples that may not have access currently due to cost or availability (capacity). We are not aware of any direct competitors to INVO Bioscience or the INVOcell device. However, there are existing infertility treatment regimens that the INVOcell will compete with when an infertile couple, in conjunction with their physician, is choosing the treatment method for their infertility. We believe that the menu of currently available clinical infertility treatment methods generally is limited to IUI and IVF.
 
Competing Treatments
 
Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI): In IUI treatments, ovarian stimulation protocols with induction of ovulation are frequently used to recruit several follicles and improve clinical pregnancy rates. When monitoring of ovulation indicates that the female patient is ready to ovulate, the male patient will produce a sperm sample in the fertility doctor’s office. The sperm is then prepared and delivered to the uterus through a catheter. Currently IUI can only treat approximately 40% of the causes of infertility. For example, IUI does not address infertility causes such as tubal disease and other conditions that are treatable by IVF and the INVOcell device and process. In addition, IUI does not produce the diagnostic information such as fertilization that an IVF or INVO cycle produces. Approximately 600,000 IUI cycles are performed annually. In Europe, approximately 220,000 IUI cycles are performed annually (ESHRE, 2016). The cost of a single IUI treatment can range from $500 to $4,000 per cycle in the U.S. and somewhat lower in Europe. The differences in cost primarily depends on the stimulation protocol and the ovulation monitoring used by the physician. Pregnancy success rates with IUI range from 5% to 15% in the U.S.
 
In Vitro Fertilization (IVF): IVF addresses tubal factor, ovulatory dysfunction, diminished ovarian reserve, endometriosis, uterine factor, male factor, unexplained infertility and other causes. IVF bypasses the function of the fallopian tube by achieving fertilization within a laboratory environment. Ovarian hyper-stimulation is common with IVF treatments to recruit numerous follicles to purportedly increase the chances for success. Follicles are retrieved trans-vaginally using a vaginal probe and ultrasound guidance. General anesthesia is frequently used due to the number of follicles retrieved and the resulting discomfort experienced by the patient. The eggs are identified in the follicular fluid and combined with sperm and culture medium in culture dishes, which are placed in an incubator with a temperature and gas environment designed to mimic the condition of the fallopian tubes. Once the embryos develop, typically over a 3-5 day period, they are transferred to the uterine cavity. According to the 2018 U.S. averages as reported by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (“SART”), clinical pregnancy success rates averaged approximately 54% for IVF, with live birth rate success rates at approximately 43%.
 
The cost to the patient for a single IVF cycle (including drugs) is in the $12,000 - $15,000 range in the U.S. and can go as high as $30,000 depending on the IVF center and which optional add-on services the patient selects. The cost of drugs for an IVF cycle range from $2,500 to $4,000. The average cost per live birth using IVF can exceed $50,000 since a patient may require more than one cycle depending on their age. Many patients suitable for IVF are unable to access treatment because of the high cost and lack of insurance reimbursement. Additional obstacles to IVF often include significant distances to IVF clinics, travel costs and time off from work.
 
Competing Device
 
Our principal ART medical-device competitor is Anecova, a Swiss life sciences company with an intrauterine device, AneVivo™, for infertility treatment. This device is a very small silicone tube with 360 micro perforations. Oocytes are fertilized outside the device and then placed in the tube, which is placed inside the woman’s uterus for early embryo development. Placing the device in the uterus is more invasive and increases the risk to patient compared to the INVOcell, which is placed in a natural orifice. After 1-5 days, the device is removed, and the best embryo(s) are transferred back into the woman’s uterus. We believe that the device is much more difficult to use than the INVOcell due to its size and the requirement to place the device in the uterus, a sterile environment. We expect that the precision manufacturing of the Anecova device will drive its cost higher than our price. The Anecova device would also only be available in hospitals and IVF Centers at a significantly higher cost than the INVOcell. Currently the Anecova device has obtained a CE Mark, however it does not have FDA approval.
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that the INVOcell has the following key competitive advantages:
 
Lower cost than IVF with equivalent efficacy: The INVOcell can be offered for less than IVF due to lower cost of supplies, labor, capital equipment and general overhead. The laboratory equipment needed to perform an IVF cycle is expensive and requires ongoing costs (maintenance and calibration) as compared to what is required for an INVOcell cycle. As a result, we also believe INVOcell enables a clinic (and its laboratory) to be more efficient as compared to conventional IVF.

The INVO Procedure is currently being offered at practicing clinics at a range of $5,000 - $11,000 per cycle inclusive of medications thereby making it more affordable than conventional IVF (which tends to average $12,000 to $16,000 per cycle or higher).
 
Improved efficiency providing for greater capacity and improved access to care and geographic availability: In many parts of the world, including the U.S., IVF clinics tend to be concentrated in higher population centers and are often capacity constrained in terms of how many patients a center can treat. With the significant number of untreated patients along with the growing interest and demand for services, the industry remains challenged to provide sufficient access to care and at an economical price. We believe INVOcell can play a significant role in helping to address these challenges. According to the 2018 CDC Report, there are approximately 456 IVF centers in the U.S. However, there are an estimated 5,000 Ob/Gyn offices in the U.S. that currently offer fertility services (which usually involves consultation and IUI, but not IVF). Since the INVOcell Procedure requires a much smaller lab facility, less equipment, and fewer specialized staff (as needed with IVF), INVOcell could potentially be offered in an Ob/Gyn office with proper training and a lighter lab infrastructure, thereby expanding the business for these physicians and allowing them to treat patients that are unable to afford conventional IVF. While INVOcell to date has been primarily offered in existing IVF centers (as an additional option for patients), the lower facility cost hurdles to provide our solution potentially opens the door to utilize the existing Ob/Gyn network of providers as well as establish new start-up clinics dedicated to providing INVOcell. Thus, in addition to lowering costs, we believe INVOcell can address a key industry challenge related to capacity through its ability to expand and decentralize the market and increase the number of points of care for patients. This powerful combination of lower cost and added capacity has the potential to dramatically open up access to care for patients around the world.
 
Greater patient involvement: With the INVO Procedure, the patient uses their own body as the incubation environment. This creates a greater sense of involvement, comfort and participation for patients with the fertilization happening within their own body. In some cases, this may also free a couple from ethical or religious concerns, or fears of laboratory mix-ups.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
Customers
 
Currently, our direct customers are the distributors and partners we have engaged in various countries, who in turn promote and sell the INVOcell Procedure to doctors and patients. Our focus is on finding the right partners in each region who we believe can best aid us in commercializing the INVOcell device. We actively support our partners to ensure doctors are properly trained on administering the INVOcell procedure. We typically train both a reproductive endocrinologist and an embryologist from a practice. Participating doctors will likely have to make medical and business adjustments as they introduce the INVOcell device and procedure to others within their offices and to prospective patients as they determine where we fit into their practice. Our business is dependent on the continuance of our distribution relationship with Ferring. In 2020, revenues related to our agreement with Ferring accounted for 98.3% of our total revenues.
 
Every center offering the INVO Procedure today is in their own stage of the integration process. Some centers have completely integrated the INVO Procedure into their product offering, while others are at the beginning stages of patient recruitment. As a result of our partnership with Ferring in early 2019, we continue to experience a growing number of U.S. clinics adopting and offering the INVOcell procedure with an increase of over 100% since the beginning of 2019.
 
During 2020, we expanded our sales efforts through the creation of several joint ventures designed to establish new, dedicated INVO clinics which will perform the INVO Procedure. As part of our ownership stake in these joint ventures, we expect to invest in the necessary upfront and operating costs to facilitate the clinics in getting the operations up and running and to reach profitability and intend to benefit from procedure revenue as well as device sales. None of the announced joint ventures began operations during 2020, but we anticipate such to occur in 2021.
 
Revenue and Product Pricing
 
We currently generate revenue primarily from product sales and the amortization of the upfront licensing fee received in connection with the 2019 Ferring Distribution Agreement. We have entered into additional distribution agreements for several international markets that we expect will begin to generate product sales in 2021. We are also actively pursuing opportunities in which to generate service revenue associated with the INVOcell procedure itself via our joint venture agreements to establish INVO clinics. For the U.S. market, under the terms of our agreement with Ferring (including the recent Amendment No. 1 to the Distribution Agreement), we are allowed to own/operate up to 7 dedicated INVO-only clinics whereby we would generate revenue by offering services. We have yet to open any U.S. clinics, but we are pursuing this initiative and recently entered into our first agreement to establish the first such clinic. Additionally, we recently entered into an agreement to form a joint-venture partnership for several international markets, including India, Mexico, Malaysia, and the Republic of North Macedonia, whereby we will be a partner in the joint ventures that plans to establish dedicated INVO-only clinics.

For the various markets, we price the INVOcell Intravaginal Culture System technology based on discussions with our key partners that reflect the innovative features of the device, the savings in physician’s laboratory fixed costs and the billings the physician will receive from patients to perform the INVO Procedure. Our goal is to have the INVO Procedure offered to infertile couples at a lower cost alternative. While we attempt to keep our pricing consistent across markets, any variation may have an impact on our overall gross margins.
 
INVOcell Culture Device: For the U.S. market, our price for the INVOcell and retention devices has been agreed to with Ferring. Ferring has minimum quantities they must purchase from us on an annual basis in order to retain their exclusivity. In the international markets the price will be determined based on current offerings and discussions with key partners. IVF centers or Ob/Gyn groups purchasing a large number of devices and promoting the INVO Procedure may receive discounted prices and certain free advertising of their facility on our website. It is expected that the INVOcell may sell for different prices throughout the world as a reflection of different economies and typical pricing for existing treatment options within different regions.
 
INVOcell Retention Device: This is a single-use, modified diaphragm that includes holes to allow for natural drainage of vaginal fluids. The current model is an FDA cleared and CE Marked product purchased from a U.S. company. This retention device is sold in conjunction with the INVOcell device.
 
Fixed Laboratory Equipment: The equipment used in the INVO Procedure (microscope with video system, bench centrifuge, incubator without CO2, bench warmer and laminar flow hood) is readily available in the market. Existing IVF labs will generally already have the necessary equipment to perform an INVOcell Procedure. A new facility or non-IVF center can procure the necessary equipment for approximately $75,000-$150,000 (or less) depending on existing equipment they may already possess.
 
Sales Strategy
 
Our product commercialization efforts are focused on identifying distributors and partners within targeted geographic regions that we believe can best promote, market and sell the INVOcell device and INVO Procedure. We are also seeking partners that will contractually commit to meeting agreeable performance objectives that are consistent with our specific goals for the particular region. To date, we have entered into the major agreement with Ferring for the U.S. market, as well as distribution agreements in several other foreign markets, including Turkey, Jordan, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, Nigeria, Malaysia, Mexico, Canada, Pakistan, and Iran as well as joint venture agreements in Mexico, India, Malaysia, and the Republic of North Macedonia. On March 10, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, INVO Centers, LLC, entered into a limited liability company agreement with HRCFG, LLC to form a joint venture for the purpose of commercializing our technologies related to our INVOcell and INVO Procedure for an in vivo method of vaginal incubation at a dedicated INVO fertility clinic in Birmingham, Alabama.
 
Our sales and marketing activities are being led by our COO and VP of Business Development, Michael Campbell, who joined us in February of 2019. Mr. Campbell was previously the Vice President of IVF Americas Business Unit for Cooper Surgical, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of The Cooper Companies (NYSE: COO) and was previously a member of the board of directors for INVO Bioscience from October 2017 through November 2020. Mr. Campbell has substantial medical device sales, marketing and business development leadership experience within Global Fortune 500 and start-up company environments. During his 12-year career at Cooper Surgical, he was responsible for the IVF product portfolio sales globally including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific regions. Throughout 2019 and 2020, we further enhanced our resources with the addition of several experienced international business development personnel, some of whom are located overseas. We may selectively add additional personnel to help support the growing, global interest in our technology during 2021.
 
Target Markets
 
Infertility is a global issue with the key industry challenges (cost, capacity, access to care, and a large percentage of patients going untreated each year) being similar across regions. Current treatment options, IUI and IVF, are also common around the world. With INVOcell being FDA cleared and CE Marked, our commercialization strategy is a global effort and approach.
Insurance Reimbursement for Infertility Treatment
 
In the United States, there is generally modest insurance coverage for infertility treatments, and what coverage there is varies on a state by state basis. As of August 2020, nineteen (19) states have passed fertility insurance coverage laws, with 13 of those laws including IVF coverage. In addition, under current fertility service insurance standards, many practices require an infertile patient have at least three IUI cycles before pursuing IVF. As a result, many patients are often referred to IVF when multiple IUI attempts have failed. Despite the limited overall insurance coverage, there continues to be improvement in the insurance arena. For example, there has been strong growth in private insurance options and a greater number of large corporations that are now offering added coverage to their employees in the U.S. We generally believe the market will continue to increase insurance coverage, which will further enhance the demand for service.

Most European countries have some level of coverage for infertility treatment, but the level of coverage varies from country to country and even within countries. For example, the National Health Service in the U.K. covers 20% of most costs for infertility treatment. However, that standard is not applied universally throughout the U.K. and some counties provide almost no coverage. In 2010, in Canada, the Province of Quebec mandated the full payment of up to 3 ART cycles for residents; however, in November of 2016 they halted the program.
 
Branding and Promotion
 
We have a logo associated with the INVOcell device and have obtained U.S. trademark registrations for trademarked “INVO Bioscience”, “INVOCELL” and “INVO”. We also have pending U.S. applications to register “INVOBABY” and “INVO CENTER.” The “INVOCELL” and “INVO” trademarks are also covered by registrations with the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, and the trademark office of Israel. Our website now refers patients in the U.S. to Ferring. We will continue to provide updated information to people looking for INVO in the U.S. to support Ferring and our own U.S. and international efforts as well as the comprehensive FAQ section.
REGULATION
 
Domestic Regulations
 
The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally by the FDA in the U.S. and corresponding foreign agencies. The FDA administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the U.S. requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a premarket approval (“PMA”) or issuance of a de novo classification The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness generally can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general controls, which include labeling, compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), and registration and listing. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA in order to obtain a 510(k) clearance for the device. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or a device that was reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or another commercially available device that was cleared through the 510(k) process or that was granted marketing authorization through the de novo classification process under section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA.
 
If the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically placed into Class III. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification into class I or class II in accordance with the de novo classification process, which is a route to market for medical devices that are low to moderate risk, but are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The granting of the de novo request permits the device to be marketed, creates a classification regulation for devices of this generic type, and allows the device to serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) premarket notifications. If FDA does not grant the de novo request, the device remains in Class III. Class III devices require an approved PMA before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials.
 
In November 2015, FDA granted our petition for de novo classification of the INVOcell device. The INVOcell is intended for use in preparing, holding, and transferring human gametes or embryos during In Vitro Fertilization/Intra Vaginal Culture and Intra-cytoplasmic Sperm Injection Fertilization/Intravaginal Culture procedures. The special controls include clinical and non-clinical performance testing, biocompatibility, sterility and shelf-life testing, and labeling. These special controls also apply to competing products that seek 510(k) clearance under the classification regulation for Intravaginal Culture Systems.
 
After a device is cleared or approved or classified through the de novo process, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply.

Clinical Trials
 
All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”), regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, the agency requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies the company that the investigation is on hold and may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that require modification of the study, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), for each clinical site. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements.
International Regulations
 
We are subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries where our products are sold. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in such countries are similar to those of the FDA. The national health or regulatory organizations of certain countries require that our products be qualified before they can be marketed in those countries. Many of the countries we are targeting either do not have a formal approval process of their own or will rely on either FDA clearance or the European approval, the CE mark – although many of these countries do require specific registration processes in order to list the INVOcell and make it available for sale.
 
In particular, marketing of medical devices in the European Union (“EU”) is subject to compliance with Council Directive 93/42/EEC (“MDD”). Similar to the U.S. system, medical devices are classified into one of four classes: I, IIa, IIb and III, with class I representing the lowest risk products and class III the highest risk products. A medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts that relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are private entities that are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. The notified body must audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EU, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device. The notified body has on-going audit rights and must be notified of all significant changes to the device or the manufacturer’s quality management system.
 
With our CE marking, we have the necessary regulatory authority to distribute our product, after registration, in the European Economic Area (i.e., Europe, Australia, and New Zealand). In addition, we will have the ability to market in various parts of the Middle East, Asia and South America. Every country has different regulatory and registration requirements, and we have begun or completed registrations in a number of countries. In general, we are registering the product based on the size of the market and our ability to service it given our resources as well as based on interest received from, and the execution of, agreements with distribution and joint venture partners.
 
In 2009, we received clearance from Health Canada to market, sell and train on the use of the INVOcell and INVO Procedure in Canada. Although the Canadian government approved the INVOcell, in Canada the local physician’s college must authorize the use of new products in each province. These governing colleges also want to see the product approved in the country of origin before moving forward in Canada. With the 2015 FDA approval, Effortless IVF, CA obtained approval of the local physician’s college, raised funds in 2016, and built an INVO center in Calgary Canada. This Calgary center operated on a limited basis initially and was then put on hold by its owner for reasons we believe are unrelated to any issues with INVOcell. We intend to focus our efforts in 2021 to cultivate and build the Canadian market.

In 2012 we received Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency (“ANVISA”) clearance approving the sale and use of the INVOcell throughout Brazil. The approval opens the door for us to a large and fast growing economy with over 190 million people. In 2016 we completed a new registration with a Brazilian Authorization Holder (“BAM”) that allows flexibility within the distribution channel which was approved by ANVISA in 2017.
 
In 2020, we completed registrations in Turkey, Jordan and Malaysia, all of which are markets where we have recently established distribution agreements and expect to begin sales shortly with these partners.
 
In February 2021, we completed registration in Mexico, where we recently entered into a joint venture to establish dedicated INVO clinics with a local partner.
