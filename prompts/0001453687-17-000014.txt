Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using our proprietary synthetic vaccine particle, or SVP, technology to discover and develop targeted therapies that are designed to modulate the immune system to effectively and safely treat rare and serious diseases. Many such diseases are treated with biologic therapies that are foreign to the patient’s immune system and therefore, elicit an undesired immune response. Of particular concern are anti-drug antibodies, or ADAs, which are produced by the immune system in response to biologic therapy and can adversely affect the efficacy and safety of treatment. Our SVP technology is a highly flexible platform that is capable of incorporating a wide range of antigens and immunomodulators, potentially allowing for the development of products that either induce antigen-specific immune tolerance or activate the immune system. Our proprietary tolerogenic SVP technology encapsulates an immunomodulator in biodegradable nanoparticles to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance to mitigate the formation of ADAs in response to life-sustaining biologic drugs. We believe our SVP technology has potential to enhance existing approved biologic drugs, improve product candidates under development and enable novel therapies. Our lead product candidate, SEL-212, is a combination of a therapeutic enzyme and our SVP technology that is designed to be the first biologic treatment that durably controls uric acid in refractory gout and dissolves and removes the harmful deposits of uric acid in chronic tophaceous gout, both of which are painful and debilitating rare diseases with an unmet medical need. SEL-212 is currently in a comprehensive Phase 1/2 clinical program in multiple clinical sites in the United States. The Phase 1/2 clinical program is comprised of two Phase 1 clinical trials that have been completed and an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, and is designed to evaluate the ability of SEL-212 to control uric acid levels and mitigate the formation of ADAs. Based on data from our Phase 1b clinical trial, we believe that SEL-212 has the potential to control serum uric acid levels for at least 30 days after a single dose by mitigating the formation of ADAs in response to the therapeutic enzyme. We received final data from both Phase 1 clinical trials in December 2016. We initiated patient recruitment in the Phase 2 clinical trial in October 2016. We have submitted to the FDA two investigational new drug, or IND, applications, both of which are active. Each IND lists us as the named sponsor and is indicated for the treatment of chronic gout in adult patients refractory to conventional therapy.
Despite rapid advancement in biologic treatment of rare and serious diseases, many of these therapies are not broadly effective because they are exogenous proteins that are foreign to the patient’s immune system and, therefore, may elicit an immune response, known as immunogenicity. Undesired immunogenicity includes the formation of ADAs that can compromise the drug’s efficacy and cause serious allergic reactions. The formation of ADAs is known to occur in established treatments such as enzyme and protein replacement therapies, as well as in novel technologies, such as gene therapy and antibody-drug conjugates. ADAs can start developing in the body with the first dose of a biologic therapy and can render subsequent doses ineffective or unsafe, potentially depriving patients of life-saving therapeutic options and limiting the likelihood of success for many otherwise promising novel biologic drugs and technologies. We believe the co-administration of our SVP technology with biologic treatments has the potential to overcome these limitations without requiring changes in dosing or formulation of the biologic. We intend to build a product pipeline by combining our SVP technology with a wide range of biologics.
Our lead product candidate, SEL-212, was designed specifically to overcome the challenges faced by Krystexxa® (pegloticase), a pegylated uricase. Krystexxa is the only product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the treatment of chronic refractory gout. In clinical trials, Krystexxa demonstrated the ability to rapidly reduce uric acid levels in serum upon initial dosing. However, despite these results, Krystexxa has not achieved broad commercial adoption. We believe this is largely attributable to undesired immunogenicity. The package insert information for Krystexxa indicates that 92% of patients developed ADAs and 6.5% experienced anaphylaxis during Phase 3 clinical trials. The package insert information also indicates that during the drug’s Phase 3 clinical trials, high Krystexxa-specific ADA levels in patients were associated with a failure to maintain Krystexxa-induced normalization of uric acid levels. Similarly, a 2011 study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that 58% of Krystexxa patients who received biweekly doses of Krystexxa were non-responders.
SEL-212 consists of SVP-Rapamycin co-administered with pegsiticase, our proprietary pegylated uricase, for the treatment of refractory and chronic tophaceous gout. SVP-Rapamycin uses our SVP technology to encapsulate the approved immunomodulator rapamycin in biodegradable nanoparticles. Our preclinical data indicate that SVP-Rapamycin, when co-administered with pegsiticase, induces antigen-specific immune tolerance to pegsiticase and substantially reduces the formation of associated ADAs. Our Phase 1 data shows that SVP-Rapamycin mitigated the formation of ADAs against pegsiticase after a single dose of SEL-212. We believe that SEL-212 has the potential to offer a uniquely effective treatment for patients with refractory or chronic tophaceous gout, while also demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of our SVP technology. Approximately 8.3 million patients in the United States suffer from gout, which is caused by elevated levels of serum uric acid.

Excessive uric acid levels result in harmful deposits of insoluble uric acid crystals in joints and tissues, causing joint damage and painful inflammation. High concentrations of serum uric acid also increase the risk for other conditions, including cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, joint and kidney disease. No treatment has been approved to remove uric acid deposits from joints and tissues. Approximately 50,000 patients in the United States have been diagnosed with chronic refractory gout, an orphan indication defined as uric acid levels that cannot be controlled by available oral therapies. Approximately 500,000 patients in the United States suffer from chronic tophaceous gout, in which patients develop nodular insoluble masses of uric acid crystals referred to as tophi, which can occur either in joints, such as fingers, toes or elbows, or in the tissues that make up organs, such as the kidney and heart. Tophi are a source of inflammation and pain, and have been associated with diseases of the heart, vascular system, metabolic process, kidney and joints. There is no approved drug for chronic tophaceous gout.
We are also applying our SVP technology to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance for gene therapy involving gene augmentation, replacement or editing. Gene therapies often use a viral vector, such as an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, vector to place corrective genetic material into cells to treat genetic diseases. One of the key hurdles for the gene therapy field is to overcome immunogenicity against the viral vector, which can manifest itself in three ways. First, pre-existing ADAs that were induced following a natural AAV infection can neutralize the viral vector and block gene transfer. Up to 50% of patients are ineligible for gene therapy due to the presence of pre-existing ADAs. Second, ADAs form in response to the first administration of a gene therapy vector and prevent effective subsequent doses of gene therapy. The ability to provide repeat doses may be particularly important for pediatric patients to receive continued treatment benefit later in life as gene expression wanes due to cellular turnover as patients grow. The ability to readminister gene therapies also could provide the potential for dose titration and could be advantageous for diseases where the goal is to transfect a high number of cells. The third way in which immunogenicity can manifest itself against the viral vector is the cellular immune response to the transduced cells, which is associated with liver inflammation and loss of transgene expression.
We have in-licensed the Anc80 gene therapy vector, or Anc80, from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and The Schepens Eye Research Institute, Inc., collectively referred to as MEE. Developed by the laboratory of Luk H. Vandenberghe, Ph.D., of Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Harvard Medical School, Anc80 was designed as a synthetic precursor of AAV1, AAV2, AAV8 and AAV9. In preclinical studies, Anc80 has been observed to be a potent gene therapy vector that has demonstrated the capability of yielding superior gene expression levels in the liver compared to naturally occurring AAVs that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Based on published data from Dr. Vandenberghe, we believe Anc80 has limited cross-reactivity to naturally-occurring AAVs and therefore has the potential to treat patients with pre-existing AAV-specific ADAs. By combining SVP-Rapamycin and Anc80, we intend to develop highly differentiated gene therapies to address all three of the immunogenicity issues associated with the use of viral vectors. We believe that any such potential proprietary gene therapy products utilizing SVP-Rapamycin and Anc80 would have significant advantages, including (i) applicability to patients with pre-existing ADAs to naturally occurring AAV, a current exclusion criteria for many clinical studies, and (ii) the potential development of gene therapies for diseases that require repeat dosing.
Our first gene therapy program is targeted to treat a rare genetic disease, Methylmalonic Acidemia, or MMA, pursuant to which we are collaborating with a clinical and gene therapy laboratory at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and MEE. Under our license agreement with MEE, we also have the exclusive option to develop gene therapies using Anc80 for several additional diseases including lysosomal storage, muscular and genetic metabolic diseases. For our second gene therapy program, we are using another gene therapy vector and collaborating with Genethon in Evry, France and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, or ICGEB, in Trieste, Italy with preclinical and clinical experience to develop a new treatment for a genetic metabolic disorder known as Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency, or OTC.
In addition to developing these proprietary non-immunogenic therapeutic enzymes and gene therapies, we intend to continue expanding our proprietary immune tolerance pipeline and pursue out-licensing opportunities for select applications of our SVP technology. In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement, or the Spark License Agreement, with Spark Therapeutics, Inc., or Spark, that provides Spark with exclusive worldwide rights to our SVP technology to research, develop and commercialize gene therapies for Factor VIII, an essential blood clotting protein relevant to the treatment of hemophilia A, which is the initial target under the agreement, as well as exclusive options for up to four additional pre-specified targets. For more information, see “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below.
We are also applying our SVP technology to the treatment of autoimmune diseases and allergies. Currently, most autoimmune diseases are treated with broadly immunosuppressive therapies that indiscriminately affect the function of the entire immune system. Our SVP technology is designed to re-program the immune system to modulate the immune response to a specific antigen without impacting the rest of the immune system. We had three collaborations with Sanofi to research novel products for the treatment of peanut allergy, celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. On November 9, 2016, we received written notice from Sanofi that Sanofi has elected to terminate in its entirety our license and research collaboration agreement with Sanofi, or the Sanofi Agreement. Such termination will be effective no later than May 8, 2017. We have exercised our right to acquire the peanut allergy and celiac disease programs under the Sanofi Agreement. We were also the beneficiary of a joint grant from the 
4

Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, or JDRF, and Sanofi, which we entered into in September 2014 to conduct research in type 1 diabetes. This grant expired in September 2016. We will be solely responsible for performing and funding any development and clinical trial activities relating to further development of the therapeutic candidates subject to the Sanofi Agreement that we choose to undertake. We continue to evaluate our strategic options to continue our research in peanut allergy, celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. We intend to continue a strategy of out-licensing our SVP technology for antigen-specific immune tolerance for applications that are outside our core areas of focus. For more information, see “Business - Licenses and Collaborations.” 
We believe our SVP technology also has the potential to be used for therapies that stimulate the immune system to prevent and treat cancer, infectious diseases and other diseases. We have early-stage research programs for therapeutic vaccines for human papilloma virus, or HPV, associated cancers and for antibody-based vaccine programs for nicotine addiction and malaria. These programs use our SVP technology to encapsulate an immune-stimulatory agent to stimulate the immune system in response to a specific antigen. We currently finance these programs primarily through grants.
The following charts summarize our current SVP product candidate and discovery pipeline:

OUR STRATEGY
Our goal is to become the first biopharmaceutical company to develop and commercialize targeted therapies that are designed to modulate the immune system in an antigen-specific manner to effectively and safely treat rare and serious diseases. In addition, we intend to maximize the value of our SVP technology by collaborating with biopharmaceutical companies on programs that can benefit from our technology but that are outside our area of focus. The key elements of our strategy include the following.

• | Rapidly advance the development of our lead product candidate, SEL-212, for the treatment of refractory and chronic tophaceous gout. We believe SEL-212 has the potential to be the first biologic treatment that durably controls uric acid in refractory gout and dissolves and removes harmful deposits of uric acid crystals in chronic tophaceous gout in a majority of patients. We are currently conducting a comprehensive Phase 1/2 clinical program, comprised of two Phase 1 clinical studies, for which we received final data in December 2016, and an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, which commenced patient recruitment in October 2016 and for which we expect to announce initial data in the second quarter of 2017. We plan to advance this program through regulatory approval and commercialization, to the extent warranted by clinical trial results. 


• | Leverage our SVP technology for immune tolerance to develop additional novel uses and classes of non-immunogenic biologics. We intend to use our SVP technology to develop a range of proprietary, non-immunogenic biologic therapies. Our current pipeline includes SEL-212 as well as gene therapies designed to mitigate the formation of ADAs and therefore enable repeat administration. In addition, we intend to pursue opportunities to co-administer SVP-Rapamycin with other enzymes, gene therapies and immuno-oncology drugs. In each case SVP-Rapamycin would be intended to mitigate undesired immune response to the biologic therapy with the goal to improve efficacy and/or safety. Our strategy is to develop proprietary treatments for rare and serious diseases by combining SVP-Rapamycin with biologics that have been in licensed or provided through research collaborations. 


• | Establish infrastructure and capabilities to commercialize our products in rare and orphan diseases. While we believe our SVP technology may be broadly applicable across disease areas, we intend to focus our proprietary efforts on developing and commercializing proprietary SVP-enabled products for rare and serious diseases where there is high unmet medical need. Therapies for treating these diseases require focused commercial efforts and coordination with patient groups and investigators. As our product candidates advance towards commercialization, we intend to build a commercial infrastructure to capture the full value of our proprietary SVP products.

• | Selectively pursue collaborations and maximize the value of our SVP programs for immune tolerance. In addition to our own proprietary product development efforts, we are in discussions with potential collaborators and licensees to pursue novel new therapies that would utilize our SVP technology. For example, in December 2016, we entered into the Spark License Agreement to develop gene therapies for certain targets utilizing our SVP technology. For more information, see “Business - Licenses and Collaborations.” 


• | Opportunistically utilize our SVP technology to stimulate the immune system to fight disease. We are currently utilizing funding to develop prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines that activate the immune system to fight disease through our SVP immune stimulation programs. Our current pipeline includes a product candidate to treat HPV-associated cancers, a nicotine vaccine candidate for smoking cessation and relapse prevention and a product candidate for the prevention of malaria. We are developing our programs for HPV-associated cancers and smoking cessation and prevention on our own with grant funding from the Skolkovo Foundation for our HPV program and from the National Institute for Drug Abuse for our nicotine program. We are developing our malaria program under a sponsored research arrangement with The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 

OVERVIEW OF THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM
The human immune system is an integrated system of specialized immune cells, cell products and tissues that protect against infectious disease and cancer. The immune system recognizes antigens, which are substances, such as proteins, enzymes or complex sugars. These antigens can be endogenous, or self-antigens, which are produced by the body, or exogenous antigens derived from foreign sources, such as viruses, fungi or bacteria. The human immune system has evolved to recognize and destroy potentially harmful substances. To function effectively, the immune system must discern between harmful antigens and innocuous antigens. The immune system maintains a delicate balance between effector cells, which mount immune responses to antigens that represent potential threats, and regulatory cells, which mitigate undesired and potentially harmful immune responses through immune tolerance. Depending upon the characteristics of the antigen and the context in which the antigen is encountered, the immune system must determine whether to mount a defensive (effector) or regulatory (tolerogenic) immune response.
Antigens are processed in lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and the spleen, where the immune system determines whether to mount a defensive or regulatory response through a process called “antigen presentation.” In connection with antigen presentation, dendritic cells process the antigens and present them to T cells. When presented, antigens perceived as harmful induce a stimulatory response that can result in the activation of cytolytic T cells or helper T cells, the latter of which help to induce B cells to produce antibodies. The role of cytolytic T cells is to kill cells that harbor intracellular antigens, such as viruses. The role of antibodies is to neutralize or eliminate extracellular antigens on cell surfaces or in interstitial fluids, such as plasma. Figure 1 below depicts both antigen presentation and the related immune responses.
Figure 1. Antigen Presentation and Related Tolerogenic or Stimulatory Immune Response
There are a number of adverse outcomes that can occur when the immune system mounts an undesired response to an innocuous foreign antigen or a self-antigen. For example, food allergy occurs when the immune system mounts an immune response to innocuous food antigens. Another example of undesired immunogenicity occurs when the immune system is exposed to a biologic treatment, recognizes it as a foreign antigen and instructs the body to mount a defense by forming ADAs 
7

to the biologic, which can compromise a therapy’s desired beneficial effect. Undesired immunogenicity is common with biologic therapies, such as in enzyme and protein replacement therapies, and in novel technologies, such as gene therapy and antibody-drug conjugates.
A number of therapies have been developed to modulate an immune response. These therapies fall into two categories:

• | Immunosuppressive therapies. Immunosuppressive therapies are designed to suppress the immune system and inhibit an undesired immune response. However, many current therapies are not antigen-specific and, as a result, broadly suppress the immune system leading to undesired side effects that include opportunistic infections, skin cancer and lymphomas. We believe there is an opportunity to develop therapies that instruct the immune system to remain tolerant to a specific antigen and thereby avoid off-target effects of systemic immunosuppression. 


• | Immunostimulatory therapies. Immunostimulatory therapies are designed to stimulate the immune system to prevent or treat infections and cancers. The most common class of immunostimulatory therapies are vaccines, which are designed to simulate the body’s immune system to mount a defensive response to a specific antigen. While traditional vaccines have been successful for the prevention of infectious diseases, there has been limited success in developing therapeutic vaccines for the successful treatment of certain other diseases, including chronic infections and cancer. As a result, we believe there is a need for more effective vaccines to treat these diseases. 

OUR SVP TECHNOLOGY
Our SVP technology is a highly flexible nanoparticle platform, capable of incorporating a wide range of antigens and immunomodulators, allowing us to utilize our SVP products for specific applications across multiple indications. Our SVP technology is based in part on the pioneering research performed by our co-founders at Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, or Brigham. In connection with our company’s founding, we licensed 17 patent families related to certain aspects of our SVP technology as applied to nanoparticles for use in vaccines from our co-founders’ institutions pursuant to an agreement with MIT, the party that administers licensing arrangements with respect to patents jointly owned by these institutions. We believe one of the key insights from this research is that nanoparticles are uniquely suited to deliver precise instructions to the immune system as a result of the natural predisposition of the immune system to interrogate nanoparticles, such as viruses. This research led to a portfolio of patents and patent applications covering aspects of our SVP technology, which we have exclusively in-licensed with respect to therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine products or processes. We have aggressively sought to extend and protect the proprietary intellectual property underlying the composition and use of SVP for antigen-specific immunomodulation.
We are currently developing our SVP technology for:

• | the treatment of chronic tophaceous and refractory gout;


• | antigen-specific immune tolerance for gene therapy involving gene augmentation, replacement or editing;


• | application with marketed products, product candidates in development and novel biologic drugs that would otherwise be too immunogenic to develop; and


• | immune stimulation programs to prevent and treat cancer, infectious diseases and other diseases.

SVP are designed to remain intact after injection into the body and accumulate selectively in lymphoid organs, which include lymph nodes and the spleen, where the immune response is coordinated. SVP are designed to be processed by specialized immune cells, such as dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells that initiate and regulate immune responses, where they deliver the antigen and immunomodulator in a coordinated and targeted manner. Depending on the type of immunomodulator encapsulated in the SVP, our technology is designed to induce either a:

• | tolerogenic response to mitigate the formation of ADAs against a biologic drug or treat allergies and autoimmune diseases; or


• | potent antigen-specific stimulatory response, such as an antibody response to a microbial antigen or a cytolytic T cell response to a tumor antigen.

A tolerogenic response is the induction of immune tolerance or non-responsiveness to a specific antigen. Cytolytic T cells are specialized antigen-specific immune cells that target and kill cells that harbor a specific antigen.
Figure 2 below depicts the process by which SVP communicate with the immune system to induce either a tolerogenic or antigen-specific stimulatory response.

Figure 2. How SVP Communicate with the Immune System
OUR ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNE TOLERANCE PROGRAM
Our antigen-specific SVP tolerance programs utilize SVP-Rapamycin, our biodegradable nanoparticle encapsulating the immunomodulator rapamycin. Rapamycin is a small molecule approved for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients. To induce immune tolerance in the body, we co-administer our SVP-Rapamycin with a free antigen, such as a biologic drug, which is depicted in Figure 3 below.
Figure 3. Co-Administration of SVP-Rapamycin with a Biologic Drug
SVP-Rapamycin is co-administered at the beginning of therapy with a biologic drug to mitigate the formation of ADAs without requiring the alteration of the drug or its dose regimen. As a result, we believe our SVP-Rapamycin may provide us with significant growth opportunities in the areas of immune tolerance because SVP-Rapamycin can be co-administered at the beginning of therapy with many different biologic drugs. Importantly, each pairing of SVP-Rapamycin with a biologic drug also offers us the opportunity to pursue another proprietary product candidate, which can be separately patented, approved and marketed. SVP-Rapamycin is manufactured under cGMP using well-defined commercial operations, which, we believe, further enhances the scalability of our tolerance programs.
During preclinical studies, we observed that delivering an antigen together with SVP-Rapamycin provided the appropriate signals in vivo to induce regulatory T cells, which, in turn, inhibited effector immune responses, such as the formation of ADAs. In our preclinical studies, we observed that SVP-Rapamycin labeled with a fluorescent dye selectively accumulated in lymphoid organs where it was processed by antigen-presenting cells. Figure 4 below depicts a model of how SVP-Rapamycin would enter a lymph node and be taken up by a dendritic cell. We believe that when delivered in the context of our SVP-Rapamycin, both the biologic drug and SVP-Rapamycin are taken up and processed by dendritic cells in a manner that induces regulatory T cells, which can block the activation of helper T cells, mitigating the formation of ADAs.

Figure 4. SVP-Rapamycin and Antigen/Biologic Drug Presentation and Related Immune Tolerance Induction
Limitations of existing therapies
All biologics, even those comprised of human protein sequences, have the potential to induce ADAs. Whether a biologic drug elicits an ADA response depends on both product-specific factors, such as propensity to form aggregates, route of administration and mechanism of action, as well as patient-specific factors, such as genetics, underlying disease and medications. Many enzyme and protein replacement therapies used in the treatment of rare and serious diseases have a particularly high rate of immunogenicity because patients are genetically deficient in the target protein and, as a result, the therapeutic protein can be recognized as foreign by the patient’s immune system.
The induction of ADAs can lead to neutralization of efficacy, modification of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as allergic responses. Immunogenicity is a significant hurdle for the development of safe and effective biologic treatments and has become a key concern for regulators, as evidenced by over 100 approved biologics that describe immunogenicity in their labels or clinical literature. We believe that immunogenicity is a leading cause of treatment failure for patients and product development failure for biopharmaceutical companies. As depicted in Figure 5 below:

• | for 43 currently marketed biologics, over 20% of the patients receiving the biologic are affected by immunogenicity, including Factor VIII products, such as Advate®(antihemophilic factor), for the treatment of hemophilia A, antibody therapeutics with fully human sequences, such as Humira®(adalimumab), and recently approved products such as the anti-IL-17 antibody Taltz®(ixekizumab), and the enzyme replacement therapy Strensiq®(asfotase alfa);


• | improved versions of biologics that are in the same pharmaceutical class as marketed biologics, including pegsiticase, long-acting coagulation Factor VII and certain antibody drug conjugates, are affected by immunogenicity; and


• | novel platform technologies, such as gene therapy and gene editing, are fundamentally restricted by immunogenicity.

10

Figure 5. ADA Mitigation Platform Opportunities
Undesired immunogenicity represents a significant hurdle that can hamper the clinical development of new biologic platforms. For example, in gene therapy, viral vectors are required to transport the genetic material into cells. The viral origin of these vectors explains their immunogenicity, which has led drug developers to limit applications to situations where the required frequency and site of administration are conducive to manageable immune responses.
Treatment and product development failure resulting from undesired immunogenicity has been recognized by regulators and patient advocacy organizations. Recently, the FDA and the National Organization for Rare Diseases, or NORD, co-sponsored a workshop on undesired immune responses to enzyme replacement therapies and called on the biopharmaceutical industry to take a more proactive approach to addressing immunogenicity to biologics.
Currently, we believe there are no comprehensive solutions to the complications of immunogenicity. Drug developers often stop the development of biologics that show an undesired immune response during preclinical or clinical development. In some cases, biopharmaceutical companies may attempt to reduce undesired immune responses by re-engineering the biologic through protein pegylation or removal of immunogenic epitopes. However, these approaches are limited in their effectiveness. Physicians may try to address the issue of undesired immune responses by increasing the dose of the biologic, which can be prohibitively expensive and may present greater safety concerns, or in life-threatening situations by using general immunosuppressive combination therapies. We believe that our tolerogenic SVP technology could offer an entirely new and effective treatment alternative for undesired immune responses, including with respect to the formation of ADAs, but potentially also for autoimmune diseases and allergies.
Immune tolerance preclinical studies
We have conducted several preclinical studies that we believe demonstrate the efficacy of our SVP technology in inducing immune tolerance.
Transfer of immune tolerance from mice treated with SVP-Rapamycin
In a preclinical study, we observed that in vivo administration of SVP resulted in induction of regulatory T cells, which, in turn inhibited effector immune responses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability to transfer tolerance from a tolerized animal to a naïve animal, a hallmark of tolerance induction. As depicted in Figure 6 below, we injected donor mice with two injections of either:

• | an empty nanoparticle, or Empty Nanoparticle, as indicated in blue;


• | a nanoparticle encapsulating rapamycin, or NP-Rapamycin, and administered without antigen, as indicated in red; or

11


• | SVP-Rapamycin encapsulating a peptide sequence from proteolipoprotein, or PLP, a myelin antigen associated with multiple sclerosis, or SVP-Rapamycin.PLP, as indicated in green.

Two weeks after the second injection, cells from the spleens of the mice were harvested and expanded in vitro. These immune cells were then transferred into naïve recipient mice. The next day, all recipient mice were immunized with the PLP peptide in complete Freund’s adjuvant, or CFA, a potent immune stimulating adjuvant, to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE, a model of multiple sclerosis. As indicated by the increase in the mean clinical score for multiple sclerosis in Figure 6 below, the untreated control mice that were immunized but received no transferred cells developed EAE approximately ten days after immunization with PLP and CFA, as reflected in black in Figure 6 below. The mice receiving immune cells transferred from donor mice treated with either Empty Nanoparticle or NP-Rapamycin, as indicated in blue and red in Figure 6 below, respectively, also developed EAE approximately ten days after immunization. In contrast, mice that received immune cells transferred from donor mice treated with SVP-Rapamycin. PLP did not develop EAE during the course of the trial, as indicated in green in Figure 6 below. We believe that these results indicate that the SVP-Rapamycin treatment induces a population of antigen-specific regulatory cells that mediate immune tolerance, as evidenced by the ability of transferred cells to confer protection from disease to naïve animals, reflecting a hallmark of immune tolerance.
Figure 6. Preclinical Study: Transfer of Immune Tolerance from Mice Treated with SVP-Rapamycin to Naive Mice
Immune tolerance induction with SVP-Rapamycin
We conducted a preclinical study to test whether the encapsulation of Rapamycin in SVP was necessary for immune tolerance induction by comparing weekly doses of SVP-Rapamycin with daily doses of free unencapsulated rapamycin. Our preclinical data indicated that SVP-Rapamycin, but not free unencapsulated rapamycin, induced antigen-specific immune tolerance that was resistant to subsequent challenges with the antigen alone. As depicted in Figure 7 below, study mice were separated into three groups during the course of a 21-day treatment period:

• | the first group, referred to as the Delayed Immunization Group indicated in black, was not treated with anything during the treatment period;


• | the second group, referred to as the Daily Free Rapamycin Group indicated in red, was treated with doses of free unencapsulated rapamycin five days per week and weekly doses of the highly immunogenic antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin, or KLH; and


• | the third group, referred to as the SVP-Rapamycin Group indicated in green, received three weekly doses of SVP-Rapamycin combined with KLH.

Following the treatment period, all of the mice were then challenged with three weekly injections of KLH alone to assess the durability of immune tolerance. As depicted in Figure 7 below, the mice in both the SVP-Rapamycin Group and Daily Free Rapamycin Group showed inhibition of the KLH-specific ADA responses after the treatment phase of the trial. However, only 
12

the SVP-Rapamycin Group maintained immune tolerance after the challenge phase. We believe that these results indicate that SVP-Rapamycin induced a population of regulatory T cells that maintained tolerance to challenge with antigen alone, whereas the administration of daily free rapamycin did not. Notably, the Daily Free Rapamycin Group was administered free unencapsulated rapamycin at five times the dose of SVP-Rapamycin administered to the SVP-Rapamycin Group during the course of the treatment period, yet we observed that this treatment induced only transient immunosuppression during the treatment phase but not durable immune tolerance during the challenge phase. We believe that the difference between the durable immune tolerance observed in the SVP-Rapamycin Group and the transient immunosuppression observed in the Daily Free Rapamycin Group was attributable to the ability of our SVP technology to specifically deliver the tolerogenic instructions, in the form of the encapsulated Rapamycin, directly to the antigen-presenting dendritic cells.
Figure 7. Preclinical Study: Immune Tolerance Induction with SVP-Rapamycin
Inhibition of KLH-Specific ADA response by SVP-Rapamycin in nonhuman primates
In a preclinical study, we also observed that our SVP technology inhibited antibody responses to KLH in nonhuman primates. As depicted in Figure 8 below, during a 56-day treatment period, nonhuman primates were administered five biweekly intravenous doses of KLH combined with either:

• | an empty nanoparticle, referred to as the Empty Nanoparticle Group and indicated in blue, or


• | SVP-Rapamycin, referred to as the SVP-Rapamycin Group and indicated in green.

After the treatment period, there was a challenge phase in which the nonhuman primates were administered three doses of KLH alone on days 70, 84 and 98. As indicated in Figure 8 below, the animals in the SVP-Rapamycin Group, which were injected with KLH combined with SVP-Rapamycin, mounted no or a much lower immune response as indicated by the lack of KLH-specific ADAs. In comparison, we observed high levels of KLH-specific ADAs in the Empty Nanoparticle Group.

OUR SVP PROGRAMS TO INDUCE ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNE TOLERANCE
We believe our SVP technology to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance has a broad range of applications. We are currently pursuing targeted product development strategies for multiple applications in which we believe SVP products could be highly differentiated.

• | Therapeutic enzymes. Therapeutic enzymes are a frequently used class of biologic drugs to treat rare diseases. Through our analysis of biologic drugs, including our preclinical studies, we have observed that enzymes are especially prone to undesired immune responses. Our lead product candidate, SEL-212, includes pegsiticase, a pegylated uricase enzyme, which is an example of an immunogenic enzyme for which we are applying SVP-Rapamycin with the intention of improving the enzyme’s efficacy and safety. Other examples of immunogenic enzymes include acid alpha-glucosidase for the treatment of Pompe disease, alpha galactosidase A for the treatment of Fabry’s disease and microbial enzymes such as asparaginase for the treatment of cancers. We intend to seek opportunities to secure supply of and, if appropriate, licenses to these or other enzymes that we would pair with SVP-Rapamycin to enhance their efficacy, safety and use in their treatment of diseases. 


• | Gene therapies. We believe gene therapies have the potential to address key unmet medical needs for many rare genetic diseases, but that undesired immune responses to the viral vectors used for gene replacement, augmentation and editing may be restricting their broader use. Through our analysis of genetic diseases, we have identified applications and patient segments that we believe would benefit from our SVP technology. We intend to develop proprietary SVP-Rapamycin-enabled non-immunogenic gene therapies with viral vectors such as the Anc80 vector that we have licensed from MEE. We believe our product candidates have the potential to solve the problem of pre-existing immunogenicity to the gene therapy vector by using a novel engineered gene therapy vector, Anc80, and to prevent undesired immune responses to the vector and transgene that can occur with the first dose of gene therapy by using our SVP technology. Our initial areas of focus include lysosomal storage, genetic muscular and genetic metabolic diseases. Our proprietary gene therapy programs are focused on the use of vectors that have documented efficiency in delivery of the transgene in nonhuman primates such as Anc80. We believe we are the first company to systematically pursue the development of gene therapy products in combination with an immunotherapy with the goal of enabling repeat administration of the gene therapy. We have engaged third parties with experience in gene therapy and rare diseases to support the development of our proprietary products. 


• | Oncology treatments. While a variety of cancer treatments have demonstrated the ability potential to halt or reverse the course of tumor growth in patients, some of these therapies have proven to be highly immunogenic. One such example is LMB-100, an investigational immunotoxin being developed by the National Cancer Institute. The majority of mesothelioma patients treated with an earlier version of LMB-100, called SS1P, experienced dose-limiting immune responses despite the use of potent immunosuppressants. However, the few chemotherapy-refractory mesothelioma patients tolerating more than two treatment cycles in this Phase 1 clinical trial showed marked antitumor activity. We and NCI have generated preclinical data demonstrating that co-administration of SVP-Rapamycin with LMB-100 in mouse models prevented the formation of anti-LMB-100 antibodies and allowed for the administration of at least four 

14

treatment cycles, representing a meaningful increase in the number of effective doses that could be administrated without the onset of neutralizing antibodies. Further, in a tumor model, the addition of SVP-Rapamycin to the regimen demonstrated a beneficial effect on controlling tumor growth. We are seeking to further develop this program and to identify additional oncology opportunities.

• | Other products and product candidates affected by undesired immune responses. We have generated preclinical data demonstrating the broad potential benefit of SVP for immune tolerance. For many biologic drugs, undesired immune responses limit efficacy and cause safety concerns. This includes TNF-alpha-specific monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and coagulation factor replacement therapies for the treatment of hemophilia. We intend to out-license SVP-Rapamycin technology for use with other products that are outside our focus to larger biopharmaceutical companies. We believe our SVP technology may also be of interest to biopharmaceutical companies with novel biologic development concepts or product candidates in clinical development that have demonstrated initial efficacy but are experiencing issues with safety or sustained efficacy due to inhibitory ADAs. 

In addition to the formation of ADAs, undesired immunogenicity can take the form of allergies when the immune system reacts to allergens such as food and pollen, or autoimmune diseases when the immune system attacks the body’s own proteins. We collaborated with Sanofi to advance our SVP programs in the area of allergies and autoimmune disease. On November 9, 2016, we received written notice from Sanofi that Sanofi has elected to terminate in its entirety the Sanofi Agreement. Such termination will be effective on May 8, 2017. We have exercised our right to acquire the peanut allergy and celiac disease programs under the Sanofi Agreement. We will be solely responsible for performing and funding any development and clinical trial activities relating to further development of vaccines candidates that we choose to undertake. We were also the beneficiary of a joint grant from the JDRF and Sanofi, which we entered into in September 2014 to conduct research in type 1 diabetes. This grant expired in September 2016. We continue to evaluate our strategic options to continue our research in peanut allergy, celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. We intend to continue a strategy of out-licensing our SVP technology for antigen-specific immune tolerance for applications that are outside our core areas of focus.
SEL-212 for the treatment of refractory and chronic tophaceous gout
Overview
SEL-212 is our proprietary product candidate for the treatment of refractory and chronic tophaceous gout. SEL-212 consists of SVP-Rapamycin co-administered with pegsiticase, a pegylated uricase. We believe that our SEL-212 has the potential to offer a uniquely effective treatment for patients with refractory or chronic tophaceous gout, while also demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of our SVP technology. Pegylated uricase, in the form of the approved drug Krystexxa, has demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce uric acid levels and dissolve the harmful uric acid crystals that are the manifestations of gout upon initial treatment in naïve patients. However, Krystexxa has not achieved broad commercial adoption, which we believe is primarily due to an undesired immune response that significant restricts clinical use. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe that by leveraging our SVP technology to induce durable immune tolerance of our pegylated uricase, pegsiticase, SEL-212 may potentially overcome this undesired immune response and optimize pegsiticase’s effectiveness in controlling uric acid levels and, as a result, enable the effective dissolution and removal of uric acid crystals.
The market for gout therapy
Gout is a painful and potentially disabling form of arthritis resulting from excess accumulation of uric acid and deposition of uric acid crystals in joints and soft tissues, including those of the kidney and heart, causing harmful inflammation. Gout is caused by an overproduction of uric acid, a natural byproduct of purine metabolism that is produced after consumption of food with high levels of purines such as seafood, meat, yeast and certain vegetables, or an inability of the kidneys to excrete adequate amounts of uric acid from the body. High concentrations of serum uric acid lead to formation of insoluble uric acid crystals in joints and tissues, causing pain, inflammation and joint damage, and increase the risk for other conditions, including cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, joint and kidney disease.
There are approximately 8.3 million and 10.0 million gout sufferers in the United States and the European Union, respectively. The first line of treatments for gout are Allopurinol and Febuxostat. Both drugs are Xanthine Oxidase inhibitors, oral drugs that reduce the synthesis of uric acid. Lesinurad and Probenecid are oral gout drugs that increase the rate of excretion of uric acid through the kidneys, and are used almost exclusively in combination with these first line treatments. While both of these treatments are designed to prevent the formation of uric acid deposits, neither of these treatments effectively reduces existing uric acid deposits in joints and tissues. Additionally, neither of these first line treatments individually or in combination with Lesinurad and Probenecid are indicated for refractory or chronic tophaceous gout.
15

We estimate that approximately 50,000 patients in the United States suffer from chronic refractory gout, an orphan indication defined by uric acid levels that cannot be controlled by available oral therapies. Krystexxa, an injectable pegylated uricase enzyme, is indicated for the treatment of chronic refractory gout. In clinical trials, Krystexxa demonstrated the ability to rapidly reduce uric acid levels upon initial dosing. However, despite these clinical results, Krystexxa has not achieved broad commercial adoption. Because uricase is an enzyme foreign to humans, we believe this is primarily due to an undesired immune response. The package insert information for Krystexxa indicates that 92% of patients develop ADAs, 26% experience infusion site reactions and 6.5% experience anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction typically involving itchy rash, throat swelling and low blood pressure. The package insert information also indicates that during the drug’s clinical trials, high Krystexxa-specific ADA titer in patients was associated with a failure to maintain normalization of uric acid levels. Similarly, a 2011 study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that 58% of Krystexxa patients who received biweekly doses of Krystexxa were non-responders with loss of efficacy starting as early as two weeks after treatment.
Gout is a spectrum of disease with the traditional diagnosis being the extraction of monosodium urate crystals with joint fluid or uric acid crystals from a visible tophus. Additionally, high concentrations of serum uric acid increase the risk of co-morbidities, including cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, joint and kidney disease. Patients who are unable to reduce their serum uric acids levels below 6 mg/dl with oral drugs are diagnosed with refractory gout. Patients who have uric acid deposits, or tophi, in soft tissues, joints, the urinary tract, the digestive tract or the heart and a persistently elevated uric acid level when left untreated are diagnosed with chronic tophaceous gout. Tophi are a source of inflammation and pain.
Figure 9 below illustrates the association between gout and diseases of the heart, vascular system, metabolic process, kidney and joints.
Figure 9. Co-Morbidities Associated with Gout
Approximately 500,000 patients in the United States suffer from chronic tophaceous gout. There is no approved drug for this indication that resolves tophi, although clinical studies have indicated that Krystexxa is effective in clearing uric acid deposits in patients that do not develop inhibitory levels of ADAs. We believe that oral gout drugs cannot effectively remove tophi from joints and tissue due to their limited ability to affect existing uric acid deposits.
Based on our preclinical studies, our Phase 1b clinical data and market research, we believe that SEL-212 may potentially address two key unmet needs in the treatment of severe gout, the durable control of serum uric acid levels in patients with chronic refractory gout and removal of painful and damaging uric acid deposits for patients with chronic tophaceous gout.
Our product development strategy is designed to address these unmet medical needs while improving the dosing regimen compared to Krystexxa. We plan to initially seek regulatory approval for the treatment of refractory gout by demonstrating reduction of serum uric acid levels below the FDA-approved endpoint and clinical guideline of 6 mg/dl. We plan to conduct a clinical program to support a label extension for the treatment of patients with chronic tophaceous gout. During our market research, physicians expressed their preference for monthly dosing as well as for a subcutaneous route of administration. In 
16

response to this preference, we intend to develop SEL-212 as a monthly treatment and intend to develop a subcutaneous formulation following the initial launch of the intravenous dosage form, if approved. We believe that Krystexxa has been developed as a bi-weekly intravenous-only formulation to avoid additional immunogenicity anticipated from a higher dose that would be required by a monthly regimen.
We believe that SEL-212 is ideally suited for patients diagnosed with chronic tophaceous gout. If approved, our strategy is to position SEL-212 as an induction therapy for gout that would remove harmful uric acid deposits over five monthly doses on average and allow patients to switch to oral gout maintenance therapy with xanthine oxidase inhibitors unless and until such patients experience a subsequent manifestation of uric acid deposits at which time a new course of SEL-212 would be required. We do not believe that oral therapy would completely prevent the build-up over time of uric acid crystals in patients with a history of chronic tophaceous gout. As a result, we anticipate that SEL-212 induction treatment, if approved, would be required intermittently in such patients. We believe that, in contrast to Krystexxa, SEL-212 induction treatment may be effective in removing harmful uric acid deposits in most patients with chronic tophaceous gout over multiple courses of treatment in their lifetimes. Figure 10 below depicts this positioning strategy as a sample diagram illustrating what we believe to be a shift in the treatment paradigm for chronic tophaceous gout.
Figure 10. Sample Treatment Course for Chronic Tophaceous Gout.
We expect our clinical and marketing strategy for SEL-212 to initially focus on the estimated 160,000 patients in the United States diagnosed with refractory or chronic tophaceous gout being treated by rheumatologists, as well as approximately the same estimated number of patients in Europe. We believe that for these patients who are already being treated by rheumatologists and diagnosed with chronic tophaceous gout, the need for a new treatment is the highest. If SEL-212 is approved, we expect our strategy for marketing SEL-212 to rheumatologists will be to promote a switch from oral therapies to SEL-212 for patients with serum uric acid levels chronically above 6 mg/dl and diagnosed with chronic tophaceous gout. We intend to leverage imaging technologies recently recommended by the guideline writing associations for rheumatology, including the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. In particular, dual energy computed tomography can visualize uric acid deposits in joints and tissues as depicted in Figure 11 below in green and has the potential to become an important tool to manage chronic tophaceous gout and to visualize the efficacy of SEL-212. We believe dual energy computed tomography imaging use could increase the market for SEL-212 by increasing the rate of diagnosis of chronic tophaceous gout.

SEL-212 components
Our SEL-212 consists of SVP-Rapamycin co-administered with pegsiticase. Our SVP-Rapamycin consists of nanoparticles composed of poly(D,L-lactide), or PLA, and poly(D,L-lactide)-block-poly(ethylene-glycol), or PLA-PEG, encapsulating rapamycin. Our pegsiticase consists of a uricase modified with poly(ethylene-glycol), or PEG. The components of SEL-212 are depicted in Figure 12 below.
Figure 12. Components of SEL-212
Our pegsiticase is a pegylated version of the therapeutic enzyme uricase, which we have licensed from Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or 3SBio, exclusively for all markets, except Japan and Greater China, and exclusively for Japan only in combination with our SVP Platform technology. Uricase is an enzyme endogenous to all mammals, except for humans and certain primates, which converts uric acid to the more soluble metabolite, allantoin. There is a natural limit to the amount of uric acid that can be excreted by the kidneys, which decreases with age and can be reduced by some medications. By converting uric acid to allantoin, uricase provides an additional way for the body to reduce uric acid. Unlike other gout drugs, uricase is highly effective in lowering existing high uric acid levels within the first few hours of administration.
SVP-Rapamycin is our biodegradable nanoparticle that encapsulates the tolerance-inducing immunomodulator Rapamycin, also referred to as sirolimus. Rapamycin is the active ingredient of Rapamune, an immunosuppressant which has extensive prior use in humans and is currently FDA-approved for prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients aged 13 or older. PLA is part of the broader poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), or PLGA, family of biodegradable polymers that have more than 30 years of commercial use and are formulation components in a number of approved products. Polyethylene glycol, or PEG, has been widely studied in clinical trials and is also a formulation component in many approved biologic products. In our preclinical studies, SVP-Rapamycin co-administered at the initiation of treatment with a biologic drug induced antigen-specific immune tolerance to the biologic drug, substantially reducing the formation of associated ADAs.
As depicted in Figure 13 below, SEL-212 is designed as a treatment course consisting of three doses of SVP-Rapamycin co-administered with pegsiticase followed by two doses of pegsiticase alone, with each dose administered every two to four weeks.
18

Figure 13. SEL-212 Treatment Course
Preclinical development
We have executed a comprehensive preclinical program of SEL-212 in uricase deficient mice and wild type mice, rats and nonhuman primates to evaluate efficacy, dose regimens and safety.
Proof-of-concept study in uricase-deficient mice
We conducted a pharmacology study in mice that were genetically deficient in endogenous uricase. The study evaluated the efficacy of a dose regimen consisting of three immunizations with SEL-212 followed by doses of pegsiticase alone in preventing the formation of ADAs to pegsiticase. The treatment period consisted of the first 14 days of the study. In the study, mice were separated into three treatment groups. As depicted in Figure 14 below, during the treatment period:

• | the first group, referred to as the Untreated Group and indicated in black, received no treatment;


• | the second group, referred to as the Pegsiticase Group and indicated in red, was treated with pegsiticase alone; and


• | the third group, referred to as the SVP-Rapamycin + Pegsiticase Group and indicated in green, was treated with SVP-Rapamycin co-administered with pegsiticase.

The Pegsiticase Group and SVP-Rapamycin + Pegsiticase Group were treated on days zero, seven and 14 of the treatment period. Each group was then treated with pegsiticase alone on days 35 and 42 of the study, or the challenge period. Uricase-specific ADA levels were recorded to determine the formation of ADAs to pegsiticase. Uric acid levels were measured to determine effectiveness of SVP-Rapamycin co-administered with pegsiticase in lowering uric acid levels below 6 mg/dL, which is the treatment target for gout patients.
Figure 14. Preclinical Study: Proof-of-Concept in Uricase-Deficient Mice
Antibody formation.    The Pegsiticase Group developed uricase-specific ADAs when exposed to pegsiticase during the treatment period. The Untreated Group also developed uricase-specific ADAs as soon as they were challenged with pegsiticase. Despite exposure to pegsiticase during both the treatment and challenge periods, the SVP-Rapamycin + Pegsiticase Group did not develop uricase-specific ADAs during either period.
19

Uric acid levels.    After initial exposure to pegsiticase, the Untreated Group maintained high uric acid levels of approximately 10 mg/dL. The Pegsiticase Group recorded uric acid levels below 6 mg/dl after the first dose in the treatment period. However, during subsequent doses in the treatment period and challenge period, uric acid levels returned to levels well in excess of 6 mg/dL. In contrast, the SVP-Rapamycin + Pegsiticase Group maintained uric acid levels that were close to zero throughout the study.
Proof-of-concept study in nonhuman primates
We also conducted a preclinical study to evaluate the ability of SVP-Rapamycin to mitigate the formation of uricase-specific ADAs in nonhuman primates. As depicted in Figure 15 below, during the study we either:

• | administered pegsiticase alone, referred to as the Empty Nanoparticle Group and indicated in blue, or


• | co-administered pegsiticase with one of two dose levels of SVP-Rapamycin, referred to as the SVP-Rapamycin 0.1X and SVP-Rapamycin 1X Groups and indicated in purple and green, respectively. The SVP-Rapamycin 0.1X Group received a dose level of SVP-Rapamycin of 0.3 mg/kg and the SVP-Rapamycin 1X Group received a dose level of SVP-Rapamycin of 3 mg/kg.

The Empty Nanoparticle Group received three monthly doses of pegsiticase and each of the SVP-Rapamycin 0.1X Group and SVP-Rapamycin 1X Group received three monthly doses of pegsiticase co-administered with SVP-Rapamycin. All groups then received two monthly doses of pegsiticase alone. The SVP-Rapamycin 0.1X Group received one-tenth of the dose administered in the SVP-Rapamycin 1X Group.
Figure 15. Preclinical Study: Proof-of-Concept in Nonhuman Primates
Antibody formation.    We observed that the Empty Nanoparticle Group produced high levels of uricase-specific ADAs by the end of the study. The SVP-Rapamycin 0.1X Group and SVP-Rapamycin 1X Group were able to reduce the levels of uricase-specific ADAs significantly compared to the Empty Nanoparticle Group and, in the case of the SVP-Rapamycin 1X Group, inhibited the formation of antibodies. Our observations in this study confirmed in non-human primates the mitigation of uricase-specific ADAs we observed in mice.
Uric acid levels.    As expected, we could not determine the effect that pegsiticase alone or pegsiticase co-administered with SVP-Rapamycin had on uric acid levels in nonhuman primates due to the activity of naturally occurring uricase in these animals.
Based on these preclinical studies, as well as toxicology studies conducted to conform to regulatory guidelines, referred to as current good laboratory practice, or GLP, we believe that SEL-212 demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety in the preclinical animal models to justify movement into clinical development, and the FDA indicated that our Phase 1b clinical trial for SEL-212 was safe to proceed.
20

Clinical development
For chronic refractory gout, we are executing a clinical development program that seeks to demonstrate SEL-212’s ability to durably reduce serum uric acid levels below 6.0 mg/dL. The saturation point of uric acid, or the maximum level at which uric acid will remain soluble in plasma, is 6.8 mg/dL. When uric acid rises above 6.8 mg/dL, monosodium urate microcrystals form and settle in joints and other tissues, creating an inflammatory response that is diagnosed as gout. This inflammatory response is the source of highly debilitating gout flares experienced by patients. When serum uric acid levels drop below the level of 6.0 mg/dL, microcrystals will dissolve and, over time, gout symptoms will disappear. Therefore, a serum uric acid level of less than 6.0 mg/dL is defined as the target for uric acid-lowering treatments by organizations such as the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. The FDA and EMA have also established the maintenance of serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dL as the primary endpoint in clinical trials for urate lowering therapies. Available oral gout therapies are designed to prevent the formation of uric acid microcrystals but are not effective in rapidly removing existing crystalized deposits. In severe gout patients who have significant deposits of monosodium urate crystals, known as tophi, it is of clinical benefit to significantly reduce serum uric acid levels (i.e. below 0.1 mg/dL) for a period of time in order to rapidly dissolve the monosodium urate crystals. 
We expect to conduct five clinical studies in a total of approximately 400 patients with gout or elevated levels of serum uric acid. We initiated our clinical program in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2015 with a multicenter Phase 1a trial of pegsiticase in patients with serum uric acid levels greater than 6.0 mg/dL. We completed the patient treatment portion of our Phase 1a trial in November 2015, initiated a Phase 1b trial in December 2015 and reported data from both Phase 1 clinical trials in December 2016. In our Phase 1b trial, we demonstrated that a single dose of SEL-212 was capable of lowering serum uric acid levels below 0.1 mg/dL for at least 30 days, which is correlated with the inhibition of uricase-specific ADAs. We initiated patient recruitment in an open label multi-dose Phase 2 clinical trial of SEL-212 in patients with symptomatic gout and elevated uric acid levels in October 2016. This study is being conducted at multiple clinical sites in the U.S. After an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we expect that we will be required to conduct two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with chronic refractory gout. We plan to leverage our experience in chronic refractory gout for additional but similar clinical trials for the indication of chronic tophaceous gout.
Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials
SEL-212 is currently being evaluated in a comprehensive Phase 1/2 clinical program that includes a Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with high uric acid levels as well as a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic gout and high uric acid levels. Each Phase 1 clinical trial was designed with the primary objective to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEL-212 and its individual components. Additional objectives of the Phase 1 clinical trials include identifying a pegsiticase dose that is capable of lowering serum uric acid levels over a period of 1 month, evaluating the immunogenicity of pegsiticase after a single dose and demonstrating that SVP-Rapamycin co-administered with pegsiticase reduces uric acid levels and mitigates the formation of uricase-specific ADAs. The Phase 2 clinical trial is evaluating the effect of multiple doses over an extended period of time on serum uric acid and the formation of uricase-specific ADAs in more than 36 patients with symptomatic gout and elevated serum uric acid levels. We received final data from both Phase 1 clinical trials in December 2016. We commenced patient recruitment in the Phase 2 clinical trial in October 2016 and expect to receive initial data in the second quarter of 2017.
Phase 1a clinical trial
The Phase 1a clinical trial for SEL-212 was conducted at multiple sites in the United States and was a single ascending dose trial of pegsiticase alone in 22 patients with elevated serum uric acid levels greater than 6 mg/dl. At the outset of the trial, each of five cohorts received a single intravenous infusion of pegsiticase at ascending dose levels of 0.1 mg/kg for Cohort #1, 0.2 mg/kg for Cohort #2, 0.4 mg/kg for Cohort #3, 0.8 mg/kg for Cohort #4 and 1.2 mg/kg for Cohort #5. We monitored the patients during a 30-day period post-infusion. We commenced enrollment of the clinical trial in the second quarter of 2015 and completed the treatment portion of the trial in November 2015. We observed that pegsiticase demonstrated no serious adverse events and was well tolerated at the five dose levels tested. Additionally, we observed that pegsiticase rapidly reduced and sustained average serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dl for each cohort for 14 to 30 days, depending on the dose level. Consistent with our preclinical studies in animals, pegsiticase induced uricase-specific ADAs in all patients with varying levels in this Phase 1a trial.
Figure 16 below depicts average serum uric acid levels of the Phase 1a clinical trials five cohorts tested at different measurement intervals during the course of the 30-day period following the single intravenous infusion of pegsiticase at the outset of the trial.
21

Figure 16. Phase 1a Clinical Trial: Serum Uric Acid Levels Across Five Cohorts
Figure 17 below indicates the serum uric acid and uricase-specific ADA levels for each patient in Cohort #3 of the Phase 1a clinical trial. The serum uric acid levels were measured at baseline and days seven, 14, 21 and 30 and uricase-specific ADA levels at baseline and days seven, 14 and 30 following a single intravenous injection of pegsiticase. We did not measure uricase-specific ADA levels at day 21 in the Phase 1a clinical trial. One patient in this cohort, patient number two, developed a relatively low level uricase-specific ADA titer of 40 and maintained uric acid levels below 0.5 mg/dL through the thirtieth day after dosing. By contrast, the remaining four patients in the cohort developed levels of uricase-specific ADAs greater than 1,000 titer and uric acid levels above 5 mg/dL by the thirtieth day after dosing. Based on the results from our Phase 1a clinical trial, we observed that pegsiticase at a tolerated dose is capable of achieving and maintaining a reduction of serum uric acid below the target of 6 mg/dL for a 30-day period in the absence of inhibitory uricase-specific ADAs.
Figure 17. Phase 1a Clinical Trial: Serum Uric Acid and Uricase-Specific ADA Levels of the Third Cohort
Based on our analysis of the Phase 1a clinical trial data, we selected the pegsiticase dose of 0.4 mg/kg from Cohort #3 of the Phase 1a clinical trial for further study in the Phase 1b clinical trial.
Phase 1b clinical trial
In December 2015, we initiated our Phase 1b clinical trial at multiple sites in the United States. The clinical trial enrolled 63 patients with serum uric acid levels greater than 6 mg/dl. One group of five patients received a single dose of pegsiticase alone at a dose level of 0.4 mg/kg, which we refer to as the Pegsiticase Cohort. Four groups of patients, each containing 2 placebo-control patients and five test article patients, received a placebo or a single intravenous infusion of SVP‑Rapamycin alone at the following ascending dose levels: 0.03 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, which we refer to collectively as the SVP‑Rapamycin Cohorts. Four groups of patients received a single intravenous infusion of SVP‑Rapamycin at ascending dose levels of 0.03 mg/kg (5 patients), 0.1 mg/kg (10 patients), 0.15 mg/kg (5 patients) or 0.3 mg/kg (5 patients) with a fixed dose of pegsiticase of 0.4 mg/kg, which we collectively call the SEL-212 cohorts. All patients were followed for at least 30 days after their initial dose. 
22

Figure 18 below depicts the serum uric acid levels of Pegsiticase Cohort (depicted in red symbols), the SVP‑Rapamycin Cohorts (depicted in blue symbols), and the SEL‑212 Cohorts (depicted in green symbols) from the Phase 1b clinical trial. The observational data is presented for all cohorts through the 30 day observational period and for those patients who were requested to return on day 37, day 44 and day 51. Serum uric acid levels were measured at baseline and days seven, 14, 21, 30 and longer for some patients that maintained serum uric acid control at day 21. As expected, SVP‑Rapamycin alone had no relevant effect on reducing serum uric acid levels across the SVP‑Rapamycin Cohorts, as such levels remained relatively constant during the 30‑day period. Patients in the Pegsiticase Cohort showed an immediate drop in uric acid levels after dosing, with uric acid levels returning close to or above baseline levels by day 21 in four of the five patients, similar to what was observed in Cohort #3 in the Phase 1A study. In contrast, patients in the SEL-212 Cohort receiving the lowest dose of SVP‑Rapamycin (0.03 mg/kg) co‑administered with pegsiticase (0.4 mg/kg), showed four out of five patients maintaining serum uric acid levels below 6 mg/dL through day 21 after dosing. SEL-212 patients receiving SVP-Rapamycin at 0.1 mg/kg co-administered with 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase, showed seven out of 10 patients maintained levels of serum uric acid of less than 0.1 mg/dl through day 30. SEL-212 patients receiving SVP-Rapamycin at 0.15 mg/kg co-administered with 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase, showed all five patients maintaining levels of serum uric acid of less than 6 mg/dL through day 30. Finally, SEL-212 patients receiving SVP-Rapamycin at 0.3 mg/kg co-administered with 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase, showed all five patients maintaining levels of serum uric acid of less than 0.1 mg/dL through day 30. These results indicate that SEL-212 showed a dose-dependent reduction in serum uric acid levels.

Figure 19 below depicts the serum uric acid levels at day 30 next to the corresponding day 30 uricase-specific ADA titer for all patients in the Pegsiticase Cohort and in the SEL-212 Cohorts at the three higher dose levels. Four of the five patients treated with 0.4 mg/kg pegsiticase alone showed their serum uric return to baseline by day 30 and all five showed uricase specific ADA titers greater than 1000. Seven of 10 SEL-212 patients treated with 0.1 mg/kg SVP-Rapamycin and 0.4 mg/kg pegsiticase showed serum uric acid levels <0.1 mg/dL with corresponding low or negative uricase specific ADA titers at day 30. All five SEL-212 patients treated with 0.15 mg/kg SVP-Rapamycin and 0.4 mg/kg pegsiticase showed serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL at day 30. One patient developed uricase specific ADA titers greater than 1000 but still maintained his serum uric acid below the target threshold of 6 mg/dL at day 30. The other four patients showed no ADA titers and had serum uric acid levels <0.1 
23

mg/kg. Finally all five SEL-212 patients treated with 0.3 mg/kg SVP-Rapamycin and 0.4 mg/kg pegsiticase showed serum uric acid <0.1mg/dL at day 30 with corresponding low or negative ADA titers. The one patient with an ADA titer of 120 at baseline showed the same titer at baseline and at each time point tested, indicating that this patient had pre-existing low titer of antibody that was cross-reactive with pegsiticase at baseline. These results indicate that SEL-212 can mitigate the formation of uricase-specific ADAs which correlates with sustained control of serum uric acid levels through at least day 30 after a single dose.
Figure 19. Comparison of Phase 1b Uric Acid and Uricase‑Specific ADA Levels-image pending, current copy provided does not save correctly
Certain patients in the SEL-212 Cohort were requested to return for additional visits on days 37, 44, and/or 51 because their serum uric acid levels were still under control (< 6mg/dL) at day 21. Not all patients were able to return for the additional visits. The data for those who could return are in included in Figure 20 below. The data show that uric acid levels eventually return to baseline, as expected after a single dose of pegsiticase. Importantly, no emergence of ADAs was detected in those patients who exhibited low or no ADA titers at day 30. These data suggest that the treatment with SVP-Rapamycin could control immune responses to pegsiticase for up to 51 days after dosing. The data also support monthly dosing in the Phase 2 multiple dose trial of SEL-212.

Figure 21 below presents a non‑head‑to‑head comparison of the activity of selected dose levels of SEL‑212 (0.1, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/kg SVP-Rapamycin + 0.4 mg/kg pegsiticase) and the Pegsiticase Cohort of the Phase 1b clinical trial with data from two replicate, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled clinical trials of Krystexxa as reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2011. These two Krystexxa clinical trials included 85 patients who received biweekly doses of Krystexxa, 84 patients who received monthly doses of Krystexxa and 43 patients who received a placebo. Of the Krystexxa‑treated patients that were considered responders, as defined by the maintenance of uric acid levels below 6 mg/dl for 80% of the time at months three and six, the mean uric acid levels in patients on the biweekly dose regimen were more meaningfully and consistently improved than patients on the monthly dose regimen. Krystexxa has been approved for the treatment of refractory gout on a biweekly dose regimen whereas the monthly dose regimen of Krystexxa has not been approved for marketing. The graph on the left in Figure 21 below depicts the data for the four‑week period after the first dose of Krystexxa from the cohorts of patients in the Krystexxa clinical trials who received monthly doses.
The placebo control patients, indicated in open circles in Figure 21 below, had uric acid levels above 6 mg/dl for the entire four weeks. The Krystexxa‑treated patients that went on to become responders are indicated in black circles. The Krystexxa‑treated patients that went on to become non‑responders, as defined by the inability to maintain uric acid levels below 6 mg/dl for 80% of the time at months three and six, are indicated in black triangles. Only 35% of Krystexxa‑treated patients in the monthly dosing cohorts were classified as responders. Of the patients that received monthly doses, it is notable that, even at four weeks, the mean uric acid levels were above 6 mg/dl in the non‑responders, representing 65% of patients, and were above 4 mg/dl in the responders. While not depicted in Figure 21 below, 89% of all Krystexxa‑treated patients developed ADAs. In comparison, the middle graph in Figure 21 below depicts data patients treated with pegsiticase alone of the Phase 1b clinical trial, indicated in red. The overall kinetics of serum uric acid levels following a single dose of pegsiticase is qualitatively similar to that observed in the monthly Krystexxa study. In contrast, patients of the Phase 1b clinical trial treated with a single dose of SEL-212 (0.1, 0.15, or 0.3 mg/kg SVP-Rapamycin + 0.4 mg/kg pegsiticase), and indicated in green, maintained levels of serum uric acid well below the target threshold of 6.0 mg/dL through day 30. Patients in the Phase 1b clinical trial, treated with SVP‑Rapamycin alone and indicated in blue, experienced no significant reduction in uric acid levels, as such levels remained relatively constant over the 30‑day period.
Figure 21. Retrospective Comparison of the Activity of Krystexxa, Pegsiticase, and SEL‑212 After a Single Dose
While we believe the above comparison is useful in evaluating the results of SEL-212 Cohorts of the Phase 1b clinical trial, our Phase 1b clinical trial and the Krystexxa clinical trials were separate trials conducted by different investigators at different sites. In addition, there were substantial differences, including, for example, that the Krystexxa clinical trials were double‑blind trials involving a substantial number of patients with refractory gout while our Phase 1b clinical trial evaluated SEL‑212 in an unblinded manner in a small number of patients with elevated uric acid levels. Moreover, we could only compare the efficacy of SEL‑212 with the four‑week period following the first injection of Krystexxa as SEL‑212 has not yet been evaluated in a multi‑dose clinical trial. In this regard, we have not conducted a head‑to‑head comparison of SEL‑212 and Krystexxa in a clinical trial. Results of a head‑to‑head comparison may differ significantly from those set forth in Figure 21 above. In addition, because our Phase 1b clinical trial and the Krystexxa clinical trials were separate trials and because Cohort #6 of our Phase 1b clinical trial involved only five patients, differences between the results of our Phase 1b clinical trial and the two Krystexxa clinical trials may not be statistically or clinically meaningful. For these reasons, investors should not place undue weight on the comparative information set forth above, including in Figure 21. Based on our observations from the Phase 1b clinical trial data that SEL‑212 was capable of controlling uric acid levels for at least 30 days in patients treated with SEL-212 
25

at SVP-Rapamycin dose levels of 0.1, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/kg, we believe SEL‑212 has the potential to maintain low uric acid levels with monthly dosing, which we plan to test in the Phase 2 clinical trial.
At the completion of our Phase 1 program for SEL-212 we had dosed a total of 85 patients with either SEL‑212 (SVP‑Rapamycin and pegsiticase), SVP‑Rapamycin alone or pegsiticase alone in connection with the Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trials. The median serum acid level of patients enrolled was 7.4 mg/dL, with a mean of 7.5 mg/dL at baseline. Patients presented with an average of two co-morbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes. We have generally observed that SEL‑212 and its components, SVP‑Rapamycin and pegsiticase, have been well tolerated in this patient population. There were a total of six serious adverse events, or SAEs, in both Phase 1 clinical trials combined. 
One SAE occurred among the 27 patients treated with pegsiticase alone in the Phase 1a and 1b trials. This patient, a 62 year‑old male who received a dose level of pegsiticase alone of 0.4 mg/kg in the Phase 1b study, developed atrial fibrillation 13 days after administration of pegsiticase. The patient underwent successful cardioversion and the medical records from the principal investigator indicate that this patient has recovered. The principal investigator has deemed this SAE to not have been related to the study drug, pegsiticase. 
Among patients dosed with SVP-Rapamycin alone in the Phase 1b trial, no SAEs were observed at the lower dose levels of 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg. However, two SAEs were observed at 0.5 mg/kg, the highest dose tested of SVP-Rapamycin. In the first of the two SVP-Rapamycin-related SAEs, a 59 year‑old male developed stomatitis approximately seven days after being dosed with 0.5 mg/kg of SVP‑Rapamycin, and experienced 4.3 kg of weight loss. This patient was treated with oral over‑the‑counter and topical antihistamines followed by a steroid gel. The principal investigator indicated that the patient’s stomatitis had resolved. The principal investigator classified this SAE as having been possibly related to the study drug, SVP‑Rapamycin. The second of the two SVP-Rapamycin-related SAEs occurred in a 33 year-old male who developed a sore throat five days after receiving the study drug. The discomfort continued and the patient presented to the Emergency Room on day 15 for treatment where he was prescribed acyclovir and a medicated mouthwash. The principal investigator classified this event as an SAE and possibly related to the study drug due to the patient’s stomatitis and resultant weight loss of 9 kg. The patient’s symptoms and weight loss resolved before the completion of his participation in the trial. Both SAEs related to the diagnosis of stomatitis occurred at the highest dose of SVP-Rapamycin (0.5 mg/kg) tested in this Phase 1 clinical trial. Stomatitis is a form of mouth sores and inflammation of the mouth and lips that often limits food intake and, according to the label for rapamycin, is a common adverse reaction to rapamycin itself. These two SAEs set the maximum tolerated dose of SVP-Rapamycin at 0.3 mg/kg.
Three SAEs were observed among patients treated with SEL-212 in the Phase 1b trial, one classified as possibly related to study drug and two classified as not related to study drug. The SAE possibly related to the study drug, SEL-212, was observed in a 59 year‑old male who developed a pruritic rash on his lower extremities and joint pain approximately 12 days after being dosed with SEL‑212, consisting of a dose level of SVP‑Rapamycin of 0.1 mg/kg and a dose level of pegsiticase of 0.4 mg/kg. This patient was treated with steroids, analgesics, anti‑nausea medications and topical antihistamine cream. As a result of such treatment, the medical records from the principal investigator indicate that the rash and joint pain experienced by the patient have been resolved. This patient developed significant uricase‑specific ADAs and showed serum uric acid levels returning to baseline by day 30. This adverse event was classified as an SAE because the patient was admitted to the emergency room instead of going directly to the investigational site for treatment. 
The other two SAEs observed among patients treated with SEL-212 in the Phase 1b trial were classified as not related to the study drug by the medical monitor. The first SAE was reported in a 50 year-old male treated with SEL-212 at a dose level of 0.1 mg/kg SVP-Rapamycin + 0.4 mg/g pegsiticase. This patient, who was later determined to be indigent, developed pneumonia and dehydration which was treated and resolved before he completed his participation in the clinical trial. The second SAE was reported in a 70 year-old male treated with SEL-212 at a dose level of 0.1 mg/kg SVP-Rapamycin + 0.4 mg/kg pegsiticase. This patients developed a small bowel obstruction 34 days after receiving study drug. The patient underwent successful surgery to remove the obstruction. There were no SAEs observed among patients treated with the higher dose levels of SEL-212, consisting of 0.1, 0.15, or 0.3 mg/kg SVP-Rapamycin + 0.4 mg/kg pegsiticase.
Phase 2 clinical trial
In October 2016, Selecta began enrolling patients with symptomatic gout and elevated serum uric acid levels (above 6.0 mg/dL) in an open-label, multiple ascending dose Phase 2 clinical trial of SEL-212. Primary and secondary endpoints for this trial include the safety and tolerability of repeated monthly doses of SEL-212. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and the reduction of ADA levels.
26

As of March 23, 2017, a total of 38 patients had been dosed in the Phase 2 trial at 10 active U.S. clinical sites. In the company’s single-dose Phase 1a/b trial, it was determined that 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase combined with 0.1 mg/kg SVP-Rapamycin enabled the control of uric acid for at least 30 days while preventing ADAs in the majority of patients. In the ongoing Phase 2 study, patients are being enrolled in multiple ascending dose cohorts to identify the optimal dose ratio of SVP-Rapamycin and pegsiticase, the minimal effective dose level of SEL-212 for repeat monthly administration, and the dose regimen to take forward into Phase 3. 
Enrollment has been completed for the first six patient cohorts, and recruitment of two additional patient cohorts is ongoing. Serum uric acid data was available as of March 23, 2017. Multiple serum samples have been collected from all patients for the measurement of ADA levels, and this analysis was ongoing. Patient data as of March 23, 2017 was as follows:

• | Mid-Dose Cohorts (three monthly doses of 0.08 mg/kg of SVP-Rapamycin + 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase followed by two monthly doses of pegsiticase alone): Of the 13 patients in these cohorts, 11 patients continue to be dosed and all had maintained serum uric acid control through March 23. Nine of these patients had received three monthly doses and the other two patients had received two monthly doses. Of the two patients no longer being dosed, one dropped out of the trial and one reached the trial’s stopping rules.


• | Low-Dose Cohorts (three monthly doses of 0.05 mg/kg of SVP-Rapamycin + 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase followed by two monthly doses of pegsiticase alone): Of the 19 patients in these cohorts, one patient had completed the full five-month regimen and maintained serum uric acid control for the duration of the trial, and three have received three monthly doses while maintaining serum uric acid and continue to be dosed. Of the 15 patients no longer being dosed, seven dropped out of the trial and eight reached the trial’s stopping rules.


• | Control Cohorts (five monthly doses of 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase alone) - As expected, based upon the known immunogenicity of uricase enzymes, five of six patients who received pegsiticase alone were unable to maintain serum uric acid control. Consequently, enrollment in these control cohorts was stopped early.

Selecta developed stopping rules for its Phase 2 trial to ensure patient safety given the well-recognized immunogenicity of uricase enzymes. The loss of serum uric acid control is an accepted surrogate for the formation of ADAs and potential risk of subsequent infusion reactions. In order to ensure patient safety, these rules call for serum uric acid levels to be rapidly analyzed and dosing to cease upon a loss of serum uric acid control at Day 21 following a dose. As expected, these stopping rules have been applied more frequently in cohorts dosed with pegsiticase alone and the lower SVP-Rapamycin dose. 
SEL-212 has been generally well tolerated thus far in patients in the mid-dose cohorts, with no SAEs being reported for these patients. One infusion reaction was reported in the control cohorts, which was classified as a SAE and successfully treated. Two infusion reactions occurred in the low-dose cohorts; they were classified as SAEs and were successfully treated. These findings are consistent with the expected reduction in immunogenicity of pegsiticase as SVP-Rapamycin doses increase.
In March 2017, recruiting in this Phase 2 trial began for two higher dose cohorts of patients, which will receive three monthly doses of 0.1 mg/kg of SVP-Rapamycin, plus 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase, followed by two monthly doses of 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase alone.
Our SVP-Rapamycin programs for immune tolerance in gene therapy
Overview
We believe gene therapy has the potential to fundamentally change the treatment of genetic diseases in the form of replacing, augmenting or editing a gene. Gene therapy modifies the genetic content of the patient’s own cells by placing corrective genetic material, or a transgene, within the nuclei of a patient’s cells. The transferred genetic material enables the affected cells to become producers of a protein that is either missing or deficient in the patient. Engineered viruses that are unable to replicate themselves serve as carriers, or vectors, for the delivery of transgenes to various tissues and organs in the body. Adeno-associated viruses, or AAV, are the preferred vectors for in vivo gene therapy because they cannot reproduce on their own, do not cause pathogenic infections and can be produced using manufacturing practices that conform to cGMP.
Although gene therapy has made significant progress over the last several years, it faces certain limitations due to undesired immunogenicity to either the AAV vector or the encoded transgene. This undesired immunogenicity frequently exists prior to the gene therapy or is induced with the first dose. Once an antibody response to the AAV vector exists, it is likely to interfere with the efficacy of subsequent administration of the AAV vector. For naturally occurring types of AAV such as AAV1 to AAV10, patients can have prior exposure to the naturally occurring virus, which leads to the presence of pre-existing 
27

antibodies, or pre-existing immunity. The presence of pre-existing immunity is an exclusion criterion for most clinical gene therapy studies conducted with naturally occurring AAV vectors. Up to 50% of potential gene therapy patients can have pre-existing immunity, depending on the treated patient population and the AAV strain. Gene vector-specific ADAs frequently occur after the first dose and have been found to prevent the AAV vector from reaching its target cell. In addition, cellular immune responses have been found to destroy transfected cells. It is unknown exactly how long these neutralizing ADAs prevent redosing of gene therapy. However, it has been observed in studies with animals and humans that high titer AAV-specific ADAs develop and persist for more than 10 years, preventing vector readministration. Because of the induction of lasting antibodies against AAV, we believe gene therapy companies have focused on the single localized dose in diseases of the eye and central nervous system for which immunogenicity is perceived to be less of an issue. We believe that many gene therapy applications may require multiple doses, especially therapies designed to treat diseases by intravenous administration. Some of these rare genetic deficiencies are best treated when patients are infants or small children in order to prevent developmental defects. However, pediatric patients may have a higher need for repeat dosing due to higher cell turnover as the patient grows. Accordingly, we believe that a solution that enables repeat dosing for gene therapies would significantly expand the number of diseases that could be treated with these therapies.
Our solution for gene therapy
We believe SVP-Rapamycin co-administered with gene therapies has the potential to mitigate undesired immune responses and enable desired efficacy in subsequent administration of gene therapy by intravenous administration for diseases and patients where a single dose of gene therapy is unlikely to be sufficient.
In collaboration with Genethon, a not-for-profit company focusing on gene therapies, we conducted a preclinical study in mice in which we observed the ability of SVP-Rapamycin to mitigate the formation of ADAs to AAV-based gene therapy, thereby enabling repeat dosing of the AAV vector in these mice. At the outset of the study, all mice received an intravenous injection of AAV8, a commonly used AAV strain to target expression in the liver, encoding the luciferase gene, referred to as AAV8-Luciferase. On day 21 of the study, mice received a second injection of AAV8, this time encoding human coagulation Factor IX, referred to as AAV8-Factor IX. Mutations in the Factor IX gene can cause hemophilia B, a defect in blood clotting. As depicted in Figure 22 below, in addition to an injection of AAV8 encoding either the luciferase gene or Factor IX, the mice also received either:

• | empty nanoparticles, with such mice referred to as the Empty Nanoparticle Group and indicated in blue; or


• | SVP-Rapamycin, with such mice referred to as the SVP-Rapamycin Group and indicated in green.

We assessed AAV8-specific ADA levels to determine the formation of ADAs to the AAV8 vector. We also determined the levels of human Factor IX protein in mouse serum to determine the relative success in conveyance and expression of the Factor IX gene. We observed from our preclinical data that the SVP-Rapamycin treatment mitigated the formation of AAV8-specific ADAs in the SVP-Rapamycin Group, thereby enabling higher levels of Factor IX expression in the SVP-Rapamycin Group following-Rapamycin treatment may have the potential to mitigate undesired immune responses and enable repeat intravenous administration of gene therapies such as those utilizing the AAV8 vector.

In addition to eliciting antibody responses against the viral capsid (a protein shell that encloses the virus’s genetic material), gene therapy can also induce cellular immunity mediated by cytolytic T cells, or CD8 T cells. CD8 T cells can reduce the effectiveness of gene therapy by specifically killing those cells that have taken up the AAV capsid and/or express the encoded transgene protein product. In a preclinical study, we assessed the CD8 T cell levels in the liver following the treatment of mice with an AAV8 vector alone and in combination with SVP-Rapamycin on days 0 and 21 of the study. Naïve mice that were not treated with either an AAV8 vector or SVP-Rapamycin were used as a control. On day 53, we then quantified the level of CD8 T cells in the liver by using a process known as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, to amplify messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA, encoding the CD8 gene. As depicted in Figure 23 below, in this study, we observed that livers isolated from mice treated with the AAV8 vector alone showed a substantial increase in CD8 T cells compared to the naïve mice, which received neither an AAV8 vector nor SVP-Rapamycin. Based on our observations, we believe that the co-administration of SVP-Rapamycin with the AAV vector inhibited this increase in CD8 T cells.

We also evaluated the ability of SVP-Rapamycin to mitigate the formation of ADAs to AAV capsids in nonhuman primates in a preclinical study. As depicted in Figure 24b below, nonhuman primates were screened on different dates for the presence of AAV-specific ADAs. On a later date, we drew blood from the nonhuman primates to evaluate the levels of AAV-specific ADAs again. This date is depicted in Figure 24b below as day -12 as it occurred 12 days prior to day zero of the study when the nonhuman primates received an intravenous injection of AAV8. As depicted in Figure 24a below, on day zero of the study, in addition to receiving an injection of AAV8, one nonhuman primate received empty nanoparticles, referred to as the Empty Nanoparticles Subject and indicated in purple, and two nonhuman primates received SVP-Rapamycin, referred to as SVP-Rapamycin Subject No. 1 and SVP-Rapamycin Subject No. 2 and indicated in orange and red, respectively. As depicted in Figure 24b below, on days three, 15 and 45 of the study, we again drew blood from the nonhuman primates and tested it for the presence of AAV8-specific ADAs. As depicted in Figure 24a below, on day 30 of the study, we administered to all nonhuman primates an injection of AAV-Human Factor IX together with an injection of empty nanoparticles for the Empty Nanoparticles Subject or an injection of SVP-Rapamycin for SVP-Rapamycin Subject No. 1 and SVP-Rapamycin Subject No. 2. As depicted in Figure 24c below, on day 45 of the study we tested the nonhuman primates’ serum for levels of Human-Factor IX.
We assessed AAV8-specific ADA levels to determine the formation of ADAs in nonhuman primates to the AAV8 vector. We also determined the levels of human Factor IX protein in nonhuman primate serum to determine the relative success in conveyance and expression of the Factor IX gene. We observed from our preclinical data that the SVP-Rapamycin treatment mitigated the formation of AAV8-specific ADAs in SVP-Rapamycin Subject No. 1 and SVP-Rapamycin Subject No. 2, thereby enabling higher levels of Factor IX expression in the SVP-Rapamycin Subjects following the second injection on day 30 as compared to the Empty Nanoparticles Subject. We believe these results further indicate that the SVP-Rapamycin treatment may have the potential to mitigate undesired immune responses and enable repeat intravenous administration of gene therapies such as those utilizing the AAV8 vector.
Figure 24. Preclinical Study: SVP-Rapamycin Co-Administered with AAV-Based Gene Therapy in Nonhuman Primates
We believe SVP technology can be applied to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance for gene therapy involving gene augmentation, replacement or editing. Gene therapies often use a viral vector, such as an AAV vector, to place corrective genetic material into cells to treat genetic diseases. One of the key hurdles for the gene therapy field is to overcome immunogenicity against the viral vector, which can manifest itself in three ways. First, pre-existing ADAs that were induced following a natural AAV infection can neutralize the viral vector and block gene transfer. Up to 50% of patients are ineligible for gene therapy due to the presence of pre-existing ADAs. Second, ADAs form in response to a first administration of a gene therapy vector and prevent effective subsequent doses of gene therapy. The ability to provide repeat doses would allow for pediatric patients to receive additional treatments later in life if gene expression wanes due to cellular turnover as the patients grow. The ability to readminister gene therapies also could provide the potential for dose titration and could be advantageous for diseases where the goal is to transfect a high number of cells. The third way in which immunogenicity can manifest itself 
30

against the viral vector is the cellular immune response to the transduced cells, which is associated with liver inflammation and loss of transgene expression.
We have in-licensed the Anc80 vector from MEE. In preclinical studies, Anc80 has been observed to be a potent gene therapy vector that has demonstrated the capability of yielding superior gene expression levels in the liver compared to vectors based on naturally occurring AAV that are currently evaluated in clinical trials. As a synthetic vector, we believe Anc80 has limited cross-reactivity to naturally-occurring AAVs and therefore has the potential to treat patients with pre-existing AAV-specific ADAs. By combining SVP-Rapamycin and Anc80, we intend to develop highly differentiated gene therapies to address all three of the immunogenicity issues associated with the use of viral vectors. We also intend to develop the combination of Anc80 and SVP-Rapamycin to expand the potential application of gene therapies. The goals would include (i) the ability to treat patients with pre-existing ADAs to naturally occurring AAV, a current exclusion criteria for many clinical studies, and (ii) treating diseases that require repeat dosing due to a young patient population or the need to reach higher levels of protein expression than can be achieved with a single dose.
In collaboration with the clinical and gene therapy laboratory at the NIH and MEE, we plan to develop a product candidate utilizing the Anc80 vector for the treatment of methylmalonic acidemia, or MMA, which can cause severe developmental defects and premature death as a result of an accumulation of toxic metabolites. Other than dietary and cofactor therapy, organ transplantation is the only existing option for patients with isolated MMA, a severe organic acidemia most frequently caused by mutations in the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT). In January 2017 we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc. to scale up and manufacture an Anc80 AAV-based gene therapy product for our development of a potential product candidate for MMA.
Under our license agreement with MEE, we also have the exclusive option to develop gene therapies using Anc80 for several additional diseases including lysosomal storage, muscular and genetic metabolic diseases. 
For our second gene therapy program, we plan to develop another product candidate for the treatment of OTC deficiency, which is another metabolic disorder. We are pursuing this second indication through collaborations with third parties with preclinical and clinical experience in this area.

Our SVP-Rapamycin program for immunotoxins
We entered a research collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to investigate the ability of SVP-Rapamycin to mitigate ADAs to LMB-100, a second-generation immunotoxin being developed for the treatment of solid cancers. LMB-100 is a fusion protein comprised of an antibody fragment targeting mesothelioma, an antigen over-expressed in mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other solid tumors fused via a cleavable linker to an engineered fragment of the Pseudomonas exotoxin A protein. A first generation immunotoxin, termed SS1P, was highly immunogenic in mesothelioma patients, with most patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial limited to one or two cycles of treatment (each cycle consisting of three injections of LMB-100 administered every other day), even with concomitant immunosuppressive therapy [Hassan et al., Sci Trans Med 2013, 5:208ra147]. However those patients that could tolerate more than 2 cycles showed major tumor regression. These data suggested that further mitigation of ADAs may be beneficial.
Preclinical data generated at the NCI showed that the addition of SVP-Rapamycin to the first two treatment cycles of LMB-100 inhibited the formation of ADAs and enabled dosing of at least four cycles of treatment in mice (Figure 25a). Furthermore, therapeutic treatment of mice pre-sensitized with LMB-100 to induce ADAs showed a drop in ADA titers after being challenged with LMB-100 in combination with SVP-Rapamycin. In contrast, mice challenged with LMB-100 alone showed a dramatic boost in titers, while mice challenged with saline showed no significant change in ADA titers (Figure 25b). Next, the effects of LMB-100 alone or in combination with SVP-Rapamycin were tested in immunocompetent mice with pre-existing ADAs and bearing syngeneic mesothelioma tumors expressing human mesothelin. LMB-100 alone had no effect on tumor growth; whereas, SVP-Rapamycin administered with the first dose of each cycle of LMB-100 inhibited tumor growth (Figure 25c). Importantly, SVP-Rapamycin alone did not enhance tumor growth in immunocompetent mice (Figure 25d).

Our SVP-Rapamycin programs for marketed biologics
In preclinical studies, we have observed the ability of SVP-Rapamycin to inhibit the formation of ADAs when co-administered with several marketed biologics, including Myozyme®(alglucosidase alfa), Humira®(adalimumab) and Advate®(antihemophilic factor). Myozyme is an enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease. Humira is an anti-inflammatory medication that is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Advate is a recombinant human clotting factor VIII used in the treatment of hemophilia A. 
In February 2017 Dr. Priya Kishnani, Chief of Medical Genetics at Duke University Medical Center and one of the world’s leading experts in the treatment of Pompe disease, made a presentation at the 13th Annual WORLDSymposium entitled “A pilot study on using rapamycin-carrying synthetic vaccine particles (SVP) in conjunction with enzyme replacement therapy to induce immune tolerance in Pompe disease.” Dr. Kishnani’s presentation described a recent Duke University Medical Center preclinical study demonstrating that SVP-Rapamycin mitigates the formation of ADAs to alglucosidase alfa in a mouse model of Pompe disease. Animals treated with alglucosidase alfa and SVP-Rapamycin had significantly increased glycogen clearance in skeletal muscles and improved motor function as compared to treatment with alglucosidase alfa alone or with the global immunosuppressant methotrexate.
In another preclinical study, we co-administered SVP-Rapamycin with Humira in genetically modified mice that produce human TNF-alpha, a protein involved in systemic inflammation. Due to the constitutive expression of TNF-alpha, these mice spontaneously developed arthritis. In connection with this study:

• | one group of mice, referred to as the Untreated Group and indicated in black in Figure 26c below, were left untreated;


• | a second group of mice, referred to as the Humira Group and indicated in blue in Figures 26a through 24d below, were treated weekly with Humira alone from weeks 5 through 20; and


• | a third group of mice, referred to as the SVP-Rapamycin Group and indicated in green in Figures 26a through 26d below, were treated weekly with SVP-Rapamycin together with Humira from weeks five through 11 and then weekly with Humira alone from weeks 12 to 20.

We evaluated Humira-specific ADA levels to determine the formation of ADAs to Humira. Levels of Humira in serum, or in the blood, were measured to determine whether the formation of ADAs increased the clearance of Humira in serum. In addition, we measured the arthritis score, based on the level of severity of the disease, each week from weeks 10 through 20, for each of the three groups.
As depicted in Figure 26a below, we observed a reduction in the formation of ADAs to Humira in the SVP-Rapamycin Group as compared to the Humira Group at week 20. Consistent with the observation of the formation of ADAs, as depicted in Figure 26b below, we observed a higher level of Humira in serum in the SVP-Rapamycin Group as compared to the Humira Group at week 19. As expected, mice in the Untreated Group did not show any Humira-specific ADAs or the presence of Humira in serum. As depicted in Figure 26c below, we observed a decrease in arthritis in the SVP-Rapamycin Group as compared to both the Humira Group and Untreated Group. Notably, the inhibition of ADAs and protection from arthritis were observed through the termination of the study at 20 weeks, even though the last treatment with SVP-Rapamycin was at 11 weeks.

Figure 26d below depicts an x-ray at week 20 of a severely eroded ankle joint in an arthritic mouse in the Humira Group compared to the normal ankle joint of a mouse in the Humira + SVP-Rapamycin Group.
Based on these observations, we believe the co-administration of SVP-Rapamycin with Humira results in the formation of less anti-Humira ADAs, which, in turn, increases the therapeutic levels of Humira in serum and improves the efficacy of Humira.
Figures 26a through 26d. Preclinical Study: SVP-Rapamycin Co-Administered with Humira
We also conducted a preclinical study evaluating SVP-Rapamycin co-administered with Advate in mice with hemophilia A, a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective blood coagulation Factor VIII. As depicted in Figures 27a through 27c below, during the first 28 days of the study, or the treatment period:

• | the first group of mice, referred to as the Empty Nanoparticle Group and indicated in blue, received five weekly injections of empty nanoparticle together with Advate; and


• | the second group of mice, referred to as the SVP-Rapamycin Group and indicated in green, received five weekly doses of SVP-Rapamycin together with Advate.

All groups were then challenged with five injections of Advate on days 57, 81, 125, 143 and 187 of the study, referred to as the challenge period. We also administered an unrelated antigen, bacteriophage PhiX174 on days 81, 95 and 143, into all mice to evaluate whether SVP-Rapamycin caused global immunosuppression. We evaluated Advate-specific ADA levels to determine the formation of ADAs to Advate. We also evaluated PhiX174-specific ADA levels to determine the specificity of the SVP-Rapamycin and Advate treatment.
As depicted in Figure 27a below, we observed a reduction in the formation of ADAs to Advate in the SVP-Rapamycin Group as compared to the Empty Nanoparticle Group, which lasted over five months following the last treatment of SVP-Rapamycin. We also observed that when both groups were immunized with a different antigen, PhiX174, the SVP-Rapamycin Group and the Empty Nanoparticle Group showed relatively similar levels of PhiX174-specific ADA levels, suggesting that the SVP-Rapamycin treatment does not induce global immunosuppression, as depicted in Figure 27b below.
34

In a separate study, the ability of mice to control bleeding following repeated administration of Factor VIII was evaluated and expressed as the percentage of normalized hemoglobin levels, as depicted in Figure 27c below. A higher percentage of normalized hemoglobin levels indicate an increased ability of the mice to control bleeding. As depicted in Figure 27c below, we observed that mice in the SVP-Rapamycin Group were able to control bleeding at a higher rate than mice in the Empty Nanoparticle Group.
Based on our observations, we believe the co-administration of SVP-Rapamycin with Advate inhibits the formation of anti-Advate ADAs, which, in turn, increases the efficacy of Advate to treat hemophilia A, but does not trigger global immunosuppression.

Our allergy and autoimmune disease programs
We are applying our SVP technology to the treatment of allergies and autoimmune diseases. Currently, many autoimmune diseases are treated with immunosuppressive therapies that indiscriminately affect the function of the entire immune system. Our SVP technology, however, is designed to reprogram the immune system to induce tolerance to a specific antigen that is 
35

causing the autoimmune disease, without impacting the rest of the immune system. Sanofi initiated and funded a discovery collaboration with us for the development of product candidates to treat peanut allergy and celiac disease, which led to the License and Research Collaboration Agreement between us and Sanofi, or the Sanofi Agreement, in November 2012. In November 2016, after Sanofi terminated the Sanofi Agreement, we exercised our right to acquire the peanut allergy and celiac disease programs including certain intellectual rights and materials developed under the collaboration. We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to continue advancing these programs. 

• | Peanut Allergy. In November 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sanofi for the use of our SVP technology for peanut allergy, which will terminate no later than May 8, 2017. Our work with Sanofi focused on evaluating SVP encapsulating an adjuvant together with an allergen provided by Sanofi. In November 2016, we exercised our right to acquire this program under the Sanofi Agreement including certain intellectual rights and materials developed under the collaboration. After the termination date, we will be released from our exclusivity obligations under the Sanofi Agreement and may pursue development opportunities for this indication with third parties. 


• | Celiac Disease. In November 2014, Sanofi exercised its option to develop a SVP‑based therapy to treat celiac disease under similar financial and other terms as the peanut allergy program, which will likewise terminate on May 8, 2017. Our work with Sanofi focused on evaluating SVP encapsulating a rapamycin together with gluten antigens provided by Sanofi. In November 2016, we exercised our right to acquire this program under the Sanofi Agreement including certain intellectual rights and materials developed under the collaboration. After the termination date, we will be released from our exclusivity obligations under the Sanofi Agreement and may pursue development opportunities for this indication with third parties. 


• | Type 1 Diabetes. In September 2014, we received a grant from Sanofi, together with the JDRF for research on SVP formulations encapsulating Rapamycin and insulin or insulin peptides. The grant expired in September 2016. We continue to evaluate our strategic options to continue our research in type 1 diabetes. 

In the peanut allergy program, we pursued an immune switching strategy. Allergic reactions are mediated by a subset of T cells called Th2 cells, which can promote the production of pathogenic IgE antibodies. Our immune switching particles employ an SVP-encapsulated immunomodulator called Resiquimod (SVP-Resiquimod). Resiquimod is a toll-like receptor-7 and -8 (TLR7/8) agonist which promotes a non-allergic Th1 type T cell response. The SVP-Resiquimod particles were co-administered with SVP encapsulated crude peanut extract (SVP-CPE), which contains the major peanut allergens. C3H mice sensitized with two intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of CPE and alum adjuvant on days 0 and 7 become hypersensitive to peanut antigens and undergo anaphylaxis following subsequent challenge with CPE administered intranasally (i.n.) or intradermally (i.d.). We evaluated the ability of SVP-CPE + SVP-Resiquimod to therapeutically treat CPE-sensitized mice. Four s.c. injections of SVP-CPE + SVP-Resiquimod administered on days 40, 47, 61 and 82 protected mice from systemic and local anaphylaxis following challenge with CPE administered i.n. on day 103 or i.d. on day 104, respectively (Figure 28 and 29, respectively). In contrast, mice treated with SVP-Resiquimod alone or with SVP-Empty were not protected. Protection from anaphylaxis in the SVP-CPE + SVP-Resiquimod treated animals correlated with a decrease in CPE-specific IgE antibody titers (Figure 29). The therapeutic dose of SVP-CPE contained 0.2-0.4 µg CPE. Importantly, SVP encapsulation of CPE reduces the risk of administering CPE in peanut allergic mice. SVP-CPE administered s.c. alone (without SVP-Resiquimod) at >100 times the therapeutic dose (50 µg) did not trigger anaphylaxis in peanut allergic mice (Figure 30). In contrast, comparable doses of free CPE administered s.c. induced systemic anaphylaxis.

Translation of the SVP immune switching approach to nonhuman primates (NHP) was evaluated in a colony of twelve animals that were naturally allergic to Ascaris suum, a parasitic nematode. This colony of NHP had been used to test various allergy therapies over a period of multiple years. Intranasal challenge with Ascaris extract induced constriction of the nasal passage, which could be quantified by acoustic rhinometry. For therapeutic evaluation, Ascaris protein extract was encapsulated in SVP (SVP-Ascaris) and co-administered with SVP-Resiquimod. Hypersensitivity to Ascaris was measured at baseline (Day -14) after i.n. Ascaris challenge. Baseline acoustic rhinometry measurements were typically ~20-30% of normal (pre-Ascaris challenge). In the Latin square study design, all animals were scheduled to be rotated through four treatment groups (SVP-R848 alone at two dose levels and SVP-CPE+SVP-Resiquimod at two dose levels). For each cycle, animals were treated on Days 0, 7, 14, and 42. NHP received i.n. Ascaris challenge and were subjected to acoustic rhinometry at 3, 5, 8, and 11 weeks after the last treatment. Historically most NHP treated with other allergy therapies returned to baseline levels of allergic response by week 8. If the animals had not returned to baseline by week 11, they were subjected to additional periodic challenge with Ascaris and acoustic rhinometry until baseline levels were achieved. After the first cycle of SVP treatment, the majority of animals returned to baseline levels at week 11 (Figure 31). However in the second cycle of treatment, only four animals returned to their baseline allergic state by week 14. By the third cycle of treatment, the majority of animals were still well above baseline at 19 weeks after the last treatment. The NHP did not return to their allergic baseline state even after three additional Ascaris challenges. At 35 weeks after the last treatment, the mean acoustic rhinometry measurement for all animals was >85% of normal. The experiment was terminated at this point. These data suggest that the SVP immune switching approach is capable of inducing durable (>8 month) protection in the face of multiple allergen challenges in a natural model of allergy in NHP.

Celiac disease is a T cell driven disease with autoimmune features. We had demonstrated that SVP containing rapamycin and proteolipid protein (PLP) peptide was therapeutically protective in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). In this model, SJL mice were immunized with PLP139-151 peptide emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) to induce disease. Mice exhibited initial symptoms of paralysis around day 11. On the third day after onset of disease symptoms, when mice exhibited hind limb paralysis, a single dose of SVP-Rapamycin+PLP139-151 was administered either s.c. or i.v. In this relapsing-remitting model of MS, all mice initially go into remission. Control animals treated with empty nanoparticles start to relapse around Day 21 (Figure 32). In contrast, mice treated with SVP-Rapamycin
39

+PLP139-151 were almost completely protected from relapse (Figure 32). These data motivated us to evaluate a similar approach for celiac disease.
Figures 32. Preclinical Study: Therapeutic treatment with SVP inhibits relapses in a mouse model of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis
Efficacy of SVP was evaluated in an adoptive transfer model of celiac disease. Donor C57Bl/6 mice were immunized with gliadin, the water-soluble proteinaceous component of gluten to which most celiac patients are intolerant, formulated in CFA, and boosted with gliadin in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. Three weeks after boost, memory T cells were purified from the spleen and lymph nodes and adoptively transferred into naïve immunodeficient (RAG-/-) recipient mice that had been maintained on a gluten-free diet for several generations. The recipient mice were then switched to a gluten-containing diet and treated with SVP-Gliadin+Rapamycin or SVP-Rapamycin alone on Day 0 and 7 after transfer. Control animals were untreated and either kept on a gluten-free diet (negative control) or switched to a gluten-containing diet (positive control). Histopathology of the small intestine was evaluated at day 56 after transfer. Animals treated with SVP-Gliadin+Rapamycin showed little evidence of disease and were indistinguishable from control animals that were maintained on a gluten-free diet (Figure 33). In contrast, mice treated with SVP-Rapamycin alone showed little or no protection from disease.

OUR IMMUNE STIMULATION PROGRAMS
We believe our SVP technology, by encapsulating antigens and adjuvants, has the potential to be used for therapies that stimulate the immune system to treat cancer, infectious diseases and other diseases. We have early-stage programs for therapeutic treatment of HPV-associated cancers and antibody-based vaccine programs for nicotine addiction and malaria. These programs are primarily funded by grants and are the focus of our Russian operations.
Our SVP immune stimulation programs are designed to encapsulate an antigen and a toll-like receptor, or TLR, agonist as the immunomodulator. Humans possess ten TLRs, each of which recognizes distinct molecular patterns associated with pathogens. Activation of TLRs alert the immune system that a potential pathogen is present and that the immune system should mount a response. In this regard, we refer to TLR agonists as substances that activate specific TLRs. TLR agonists can be used as supplements, or adjuvants, to vaccines to increase the immune response to the vaccine by activating the TLRs in antigen-presenting cells.
Injecting TLR agonists alone can cause off-target, systemic immune stimulation, leading to the production of secreted factors called cytokines, which can effectively limit the dosage of vaccines by causing inflammation and flu-like symptoms. To address this issue, our stimulatory SVP technology is designed to limit the TLR agonists from creating a systemic immune response by encapsulating the TLR agonists within our biodegradable nanoparticle. When the TLR agonist is encapsulated with SVP, referred to as SVP-TLR agonist, it can be selectively delivered, together with the vaccine target antigen, to the antigen-presenting cells to induce antigen-specific immune stimulation.
Immune stimulation-related preclinical study
We conducted a preclinical study in mice to evaluate the ability of a SVP-TLR agonist containing an antigen to minimize the production of systemic cytokines, which are responsible for an undesired systemic immune-stimulatory response, while increasing the production of local cytokines, which are responsible for a strong and antigen-specific immune-stimulatory response.
In this study, we used a specific agonist of TLR7 and TLR8, referred to as TLR 7/8 agonist, that we either delivered in free form mixed with a nanoparticle containing an antigen or encapsulated with an antigen in a nanoparticle.
41

As depicted in Figures 34a through 34d below:

• | the first group of mice, referred to as the Encapsulated TLR 7/8 Agonist Group and indicated in green, received a single dose of SVP encapsulating both an antigen and a TLR 7/8 agonist; and


• | the second group of mice, referred to as the Free TLR 7/8 Agonist Group and indicated in red, received a single dose of SVP encapsulating an antigen alone together with free TLR 7/8 agonist.

We evaluated serum levels of TNF-alpha and interleukin-6, or IL-6, two pro-inflammatory cytokines indicative of an undesired, systemic immune response and associated with flu-like symptoms, to determine the levels of systemic cytokine production, as depicted in Figures 34a and 34b below. We also evaluated the levels of interleukin-12, or IL-12, and interferon-gamma, or IFN, in the draining lymph node to determine the levels of local cytokine production involved in desired T helper cell type 1 immune responses, as depicted in Figures 34c and 34d below.
As depicted in Figures 34a and 34b below, we observed increased levels of systemic cytokine production in the Free TLR 7/8 Agonist Group in comparison to the Encapsulated TLR 7/8 Agonist Group. As depicted in Figures 34c and 34d below, we observed increased levels of local cytokine production in the draining lymph node in the Encapsulated TLR 7/8 Agonist Group as compared to the Free TLR 7/8 Agonist Group.
Based on these results, we believe that by encapsulating a TLR agonist in SVP, we are able to increase the production of local cytokines without triggering an undesired systemic immune response.

Cancer immunotherapy
Cancer immunotherapy leverages the immune system to treat cancer. The main function of the immune system is to discriminate between “self” and “non-self” antigens. Cancer cells thrive, in part, because they are derived from the body’s own cells, and thus are recognized by the immune system as self. We believe that cancer vaccines could be an important therapeutic modality to treat cancer by training the immune system to recognize cancer-associated antigens that are mutated or not expressed in normal adult tissues.
42

Tumors also evade the immune system by increasing the expression of certain molecules that suppress the immune response against the tumor. This mechanism may be overcome by administering products called immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to block or overcome the immunosuppressive pathways and stimulate the immune system. We believe the efficacy of this approach depends on the existence of pre-existing tumor-specific cytolytic T cells, or CTL, that can be mobilized by checkpoint inhibitors. In some patients, the immune system either does not recognize the tumor or is too weak to mount a response and, as a result, cannot generate the CTL necessary to kill the tumor. For these patients, a vaccine therapy that stimulates the immune system and could be given in conjunction with a checkpoint inhibitor, may result in better outcomes. We believe that the combination of checkpoint inhibitors and effective cancer vaccines represents an advance in cancer immunotherapy.
HPV-associated cancer
HPV overview
HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that can lead to the development of cancer. Cervical HPV infection often clears spontaneously. However, when it persists, it can lead to the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or CIN, and cervical cancer.
According to the World Health Organization, HPV infection results in an estimated 530,000 new cases of cervical cancer worldwide, with 270,000 deaths annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are more than 26,000 U.S. cases of HPV-associated cancer per year. HPV is found in approximately 99% of cases of cervical cancer and 72% of cases of oropharyngeal head and neck cancer. The rising incidence of such cancers is thought to be related to the increasing proportion of cancers caused by HPV. In 2011, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology observed that HPV prevalence in oropharyngeal cancers increased from 16.3% during 1984 to 1989 to 71.7% during 2000 to 2004. There are two HPV strains that are responsible for more than 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide.
Gardasil and Cervarix are FDA-approved prophylactic vaccines for HPV-related cancers with aggregate worldwide sales reaching $1.9 billion in 2014. While these vaccines can prevent tumor occurrence, Gardasil and Cervarix have not been approved for treatment of patients with existing HPV-related cancers.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2012, only 54% of women between the ages of 13 to 17 had received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine and only 33% received a complete series of three, which may serve as a prophylactic if administered prior to exposure. This level of vaccination is well below the 80% rate set as a goal by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As a result, we believe that HPV-associated cancer will be an ongoing medical condition for the foreseeable future.
Overview of our program for HPV-associated cancer
Our first CTL-activating SVP program in development is designed to treat HPV-associated cancers by stimulating the immune response to the E6 and E7 proteins, which are expressed by HPV-associated tumor cells. The HPV E6 and E7 antigens are oncogenic proteins that promote malignant transformation and tumor growth. Our SVP program for HPV-associated cancer consists of a SVP encapsulating the E6 and E7 proteins, or SVP-E6/E7, co-administered with an SVP adjuvant which contains a TLR agonist. We refer to this co-administration as SVP-HPV. Both E6 and E7 present within the SVP are mutated in a targeted fashion and thus devoid of their oncogenic potential.
We were awarded a grant from the Skolkovo Foundation to support our program to develop an SVP immunotherapy to treat HPV-associated cancers. We believe the grant will assist us with advancing the program from preclinical to early clinical evaluation.
Preclinical development
We conducted a preclinical study in which we evaluated the ability of SVP-HPV to reverse tumor growth for HPV-associated cancers. In this study, we delivered SVP-HPV to mice using the TC-1 tumor model, which expresses the HPV E6 and E7 antigens. Mice were treated either 13 days or 14 days after the introduction (inoculation) of TC-1 tumor cells, at which time the average tumor size was approximately 200 mm3.
In this study, we administered to:

• | the first group of mice, referred to as the Empty Nanoparticle Group and indicated in blue in Figures 35a and 35c below, four doses of empty nanoparticles; and


• | the second group of mice, referred to as the SVP-HPV Group and indicated by in green in Figures 35b and 35c below, four doses of SVP-HPV.

43

As depicted in Figures 35a and 35b below, we recorded the volumes of the tumors in both the Empty Nanoparticle Group and the SVP-HPV Group to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
As depicted in Figures 35a and 35b below, we observed that the administration of SVP-HPV reduced the growth of tumors in the SVP-HPV Group in comparison to the Empty Nanoparticle Group, even when administered to mice with palpable tumors. Notably, the tumors in the mice in the SVP-HPV Group continued to grow to an average size of approximately 1,200 mm3 at day 20, before regressing back to baseline.
In a separate experiment, we re-challenged surviving mice on day 154 with a second inoculation of TC-1 tumor cells to test the durability of the immune response and the ability to prevent tumor recurrence. As depicted in Figure 35c below, we observed that immunization with SVP-HPV increases the survival rate of SVP-HPV immunized mice compared to saline treated mice, referred to as the Saline Control Group. The surviving mice withstood a second inoculation of tumors at day 154, indicating the development of long term immunological memory.
Based on these observations, we believe administration of SVP-HPV can both reduce tumor size and increase survival rate.
Figures 35a through 35c. Preclinical Study: Administration of SVP-HPV in TC-1 Tumor Model
We conducted a preclinical study to evaluate the synergistic effects that our SVP technology may have with certain checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-L1 antibodies. In this study, mice were separated into four groups and implanted with B16F10 melanoma tumor cells, which express an endogenous tumor antigen called TRP-2. In these experiments, we used an SVP-encapsulated TLR9 agonist, CpG oligonucleotide, in its natural phosphodiester form (PO-CpG) as an adjuvant.
As depicted in Figure 36 below, the:

• | first group of mice, referred to as the Empty Nanoparticle + Control Antibody Group and indicated in black, received empty nanoparticles with an isotype control antibody;


• | second group of mice, referred to as the Empty Nanoparticle + Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Group and indicated in red, received empty nanoparticles with a PD-L1-specific monoclonal antibody;


• | third group of mice, referred to as the SVP-TRP-2 + SVP-PO-CpG + Control Antibody Group and indicated in blue, received SVP encapsulating the TRP-2 peptide antigen and a TLR agonist with an isotype control antibody; and

44


• | fourth group of mice, referred to as the SVP-TRP-2 +SVP-PO-CpG + Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Group and indicated in green, received SVP encapsulating the TRP-2 peptide antigen and a TLR agonist with a PD-L1-specific monoclonal antibody.

We evaluated the presence of tumors over time in the mice to determine the efficacy of treatment. We observed better survival in mice in the SVP-TRP-2 + SVP-PO-CpG + Control Antibody Group over a longer period of time than that of the Empty Nanoparticle + Control Antibody and the Empty Nanoparticle + Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Groups. The SVP-TRP-2 + SVP-PO-CpG + Anti-PD-L1 Group showed even better efficacy, with approximately 50% of mice surviving at day 80, compared to approximately 15% of mice in the SVP-TRP-2 + Control Antibody Group and 0% of mice in each of the Empty Nanoparticle + Control Antibody and the Empty Nanoparticle + Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Groups.
Based on our observations, we believe our SVP technology may have synergistic effects with certain checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.
Figure 36. Preclinical Study: Synergistic activity of SVP Encapsulating the TRP-2 Peptide Antigen and TLR Agonist with Anti-PD-L1 Antibody in the B16F10-Melanoma Tumor Model
We conducted a preclinical study to evaluate the synergistic effects that our SVP technology may have with certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin. In this study, mice were separated into four groups and implanted with TC-1 tumor cells, which express the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes.
As depicted in Figure 37 below, the:

• | first group of mice, referred to as the Empty Nanoparticle Group and indicated in black, received four injections of empty nanoparticles starting on day 14;


• | second group of mice, referred to as the Cisplatin Group and indicated in red, received cisplatin on days 5 and 12;


• | third group of mice, referred to as the SVP-E7*/E6* + SVP-CpG and indicated in blue, received four injections of SVP encapsulating the E7*/E6* fusion protein (comprising mutated E7 and E6 proteins of HPV) and a TLR agonist starting on day 14; and


• | fourth group of mice, referred to as the SVP-E7*/E6* + SVP-CpG + Cisplatin Antibody Group and indicated in green, received cisplatin on days 5 and 12 and four injections of SVP encapsulating the E7*/E6* fusion protein and a TLR agonist starting on day 14.

We evaluated the presence of tumors over time in the mice to determine the efficacy of treatment. Mice in the SVP- E7*/E6* +SVP-CpG Group and the Cisplatin Group showed ~40-50% survival at day 124, compared no survivors in the SVP-Empty Group. The SVP- E7*/E6* + SVP-CpG + Cisplatin Group showed 100% survival at day 124, with all mice in this group being tumor-free.
Based on our observations, we believe our SVP technology may have synergistic effects with certain chemotherapeutic agents to treat cancer.

OUR OTHER IMMUNE STIMULATION PROGRAMS
Our other immune stimulation programs are a prophylactic malaria vaccine, funded by a grant from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and a therapeutic vaccine for smoking cessation and relapse prevention, funded by a grant from the NIDA part of the National Institutes of Health. 
The malaria program is designed to be a dual action, immune-stimulating SVP nanoparticle vaccine that we believe may offer the potential to protect against malaria by preventing infection and transmission. This program is in the discovery phase. We expect that the final report due in respect of the grant from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will be completed by the second quarter of 2017.
The smoking cessation and relapse prevention program aims to stimulate the immune system to produce nicotine-specific antibodies in smokers. We believe such antibodies have the potential to bind to the inhaled nicotine and prevent the inhaled nicotine from reaching the brain thereby reducing levels of nicotine in the brain to support smoking cessation and relapse prevention. The SVP-nicotine program, SEL-070, is in preclinical development. We had a prior SVP-nicotine product candidate that was partly sponsored by a grant from NIDA, which entered clinical development. Results from a Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in smokers and non-smokers with this prior product candidate showed that it was well tolerated and that nicotine-specific antibodies were induced, but at sub-therapeutic levels. On the basis of the data from this Phase 1 trial, we obtained a new grant from NIDA to further optimize our SVP-nicotine product candidate. We completed GLP toxicology studies for our optimized smoking cessation candidate and are preparing for a Phase 1 clinical trial. 
MANUFACTURING
We manufacture SVP using a readily-scalable, self-assembly nanoemulsion process with well-defined, robust commercial pharmaceutical unit operations. This proprietary, highly specialized and precisely controlled manufacturing process enables us to reproducibly manufacture SVP across many production scales, from milligram-scale at the laboratory bench, to tens of grams to support investigational new drug application-enabling toxicology studies and early-phase clinical studies, to hundreds of grams to multi-kilogram scale for commercial production. This well-defined process has been produced at multiple scales. We have also developed and executed the required detailed analytic characterization of our products. We have completed and released multiple cGMP batches of nanoparticles at the 50 gram scale for our SVP-Rapamycin program and at the 10 and 20 gram scale for our nicotine program.
For the SEL-212 program, we have increased SVP-Rapamycin production to a 50-gram scale and have initiated development at the 200-gram scale, which, at the current projected clinical dose, we believe would be suitable for commercial launch. The process is designed such that this same equipment is capable of potentially producing up to a one kilogram batch size scale. As our nanoparticle manufacturing process is compact, and therefore also portable, our strategy is to transfer our custom designed process skids to our contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, and have the CMO produce the nanoparticles, under our direction. This is the strategy we use for production of clinical supplies for clinical trials and would be the expected strategy for commercial production.
The pegsiticase enzyme for SEL-212 is produced by fermentation in E. Coli and is sourced from 3SBio in China. 3SBio is a Chinese pharmaceutical company that produces multiple approved products in China and also has product sales in other countries around the world. 3SBio supplies the pegsiticase used in the current clinical trials of SEL-212 in the United States. Through a licensing arrangement, we own exclusive worldwide rights to pegsiticase outside of China, with co-ownership of 
46

rights in Japan and with 3SBio owning all rights in China. Under this arrangement, 3SBio has agreed to supply us with pegsiticase. We are in the process of evaluating a back-up supplier for pegsiticase in the United States.
In January 2017 we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc., a leader in viral gene and cell therapy manufacturing. Under the terms of the agreement, Lonza has agreed to produce an Anc80-AAV-based gene therapy product for our proprietary program for MMA. 
LICENSES AND COLLABORATIONS
Spark Therapeutics
In December 2016, we entered into the Spark License Agreement to develop gene therapies for certain targets utilizing our SVP technology.
Under the terms of the Spark License Agreement, we granted Spark certain exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing licenses to our intellectual property and know-how relating to our SVP technology to research, develop and commercialize gene therapies for Factor VIII, an essential blood clotting protein relevant to the treatment of hemophilia A, which is the initial target under the license agreement.
Pursuant to the Spark License Agreement, Spark paid us an upfront payment of $10.0 million. Spark is obligated to make additional payments to us of an aggregate of $5.0 million by December 2, 2017. On a target-by-target basis, we will be eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $430.0 million in milestone payments for each target, with up to $65.0 million being based on Spark’s achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $365.0 million for commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties on global net sales at percentages ranging from mid-single to low-double digits. Until December 2019, Spark has the right to fund up to 50.0% of any development or regulatory milestone payable to us by issuing us shares of Spark’s common stock having a fair market value equal to the percentage of such development or regulatory milestone, as applicable. 
In addition, until December 2019, Spark may exercise options to research, develop and commercialize gene therapies utilizing our SVP technology for up to four additional targets, subject to Spark’s payment to us of the applicable option exercise fee, in a range of $1.4 million to $2.0 million depending on the incidence of the applicable indication.
Each party is responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with its respective activities under the Spark License, except that Spark has agreed to reimburse us for FTE and out-of-pocket costs incurred in performing certain tasks or assistance specifically requested by Spark. We retain the responsibility to manufacture Spark’s preclinical, clinical and commercial requirements for the SVP technology, subject to the terms of the Spark License.
The Spark License Agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the expiration of Spark’s royalty payment obligations with respect to such product in such country unless earlier terminated by the parties. The Spark License Agreement may be terminated by Spark for convenience upon ninety days’ notice. Either party may terminate the Spark License Agreement on a target-by-target basis for material breach with respect to such target.
In connection with the Spark License Agreement, we also entered into the Spark SPA, pursuant to which Spark purchased 197,238 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 million, which purchase price per share represented a 115.0% premium to the average of the daily volume-weighted average price, or VWAP, of the common stock during the thirty consecutive calendar days ending on, and including, December 1, 2016. Under the terms of the Spark SPA, Spark has also agreed to make two additional investments of $5.0 million in our common stock, the first between May 1, 2017 and June 1, 2017, and the second between October 1, 2017 and November 1, 2017. In each case, such additional shares will be purchased at a price per share equal to 115.0% of the average of the daily VWAPs for the common stock during the thirty consecutive calendar days immediately prior to the date on which Spark notifies us of its election to purchase the applicable additional shares (subject to our election to refuse the applicable purchase and certain ownership limitations). The aggregate number of shares that we may issue pursuant to the Spark SPA may not exceed the lesser of (i) 2,758,112 shares and (ii) such number of shares that would require us to obtain prior shareholder approval under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
In November 2008, we entered into a license agreement with MIT, which we refer to as the MIT License. We amended the MIT License in January 2010, November 2012, August 2013 and November 2016. Under the MIT License, we acquired an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to develop, make, sell, use and import certain licensed products that are therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines and use certain licensed processes in the exercise of rights to the licensed products, the manufacture, sale and practice of which are covered by patent rights owned or controlled by MIT, including patents jointly 
47

owned with Brigham, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, the Immune Disease Institute and the Children’s Medical Center Corporation. Our exclusivity is subject to certain retained rights of these institutions and other third parties.
Pursuant to the MIT License, we are required to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize one or more licensed products or licensed processes, and to thereafter make such products and processes reasonably available to the public, which include annual minimum spending on research, development and commercialization by us or our sublicensees. Upon our entry into the MIT License, we paid MIT a non-refundable license issue fee, reimbursed certain of MIT’s costs and issued shares of our common stock to MIT and the other institutional patent owners which were subject to certain anti-dilution, registration and other protective rights. We are obligated to pay MIT annual maintenance fees, which may be credited against the low-single-digit running royalty on annual net sales that we are also obligated to pay. Additionally, we are required to pay MIT (i) developmental milestones up to an aggregate of $1.5 million, (ii) a mid-single digit percentage of income received in consideration of practice of patent rights or development of the products or processes in collaboration with or on behalf of a non-sublicensee corporate partner, (iii) a specified percentage of income received from sublicensees in the low thirties prior to November 25, 2009 and, after that, between 10% and 20%, and (iv) certain fees and costs. Pursuant to the MIT License, we are required to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize one or more licensed products or licensed processes, and to thereafter make such products and processes reasonably available to the public, which include annual minimum spending of a specified amount in the low-to-mid-six figures in 2008 and 2009 and, thereafter, in the low seven figures, on research, development and commercialization by or our sublicensees.
We may terminate the MIT License at any time upon six months written notice. MIT has the right to terminate the MIT License immediately upon written notice to us if we cease to carry on our business related to the MIT License, fail to maintain insurance as required under the MIT License, file for bankruptcy, fail to pay amounts due under the MIT License, challenge or assist others in bringing a challenge to MIT’s patents or fail to cure material breach within 60 days’ written notice thereof. Absent early termination, the MIT License will continue until the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire patent right subject to the MIT License.
Sanofi
In November 2012, we entered into a license and research collaboration agreement with Sanofi, which we refer to as the Sanofi Agreement. Under the terms of the Sanofi Agreement, we granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide license to certain intellectual property rights and technologies owned by or licensed exclusively to us, including a sublicense under the MIT License, for the research, development and commercialization of one or more treatments for peanut allergies. The Sanofi Agreement contains an option to extend the license grant for two additional allergy indications, including celiac disease but excluding house dust mite allergies. In November 2014, Sanofi exercised the option to include celiac disease as an additional indication and the Sanofi Agreement was amended to add terms specific to the celiac disease indication and to terminate Sanofi’s right to exercise its option for any additional indications in May 2015. Except as authorized by Sanofi or permitted under the Sanofi Agreement, during the term of the Sanofi Agreement, our exclusivity obligations prevent us from researching, developing, or commercializing products in these indications or granting third party licenses under the intellectual property rights and technologies licensed to Sanofi for use in these indications.
Under the terms of the research collaboration portion of the Sanofi Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the activities set out for us in the research and development plans created and overseen by a joint research committee. We are responsible for manufacturing all vaccines required for research, development and commercialization of licensed products.
The research term for the first indication expired on the third anniversary of the Sanofi Agreement (November 27, 2015). We completed our research obligations within the initial three year period and are not obligated to perform any further research on the specific indication under the Sanofi Agreement. A vaccine candidate for development and commercialization was not selected by Sanofi by the end of the research plan.
On November 9, 2016, we received written notice from Sanofi that Sanofi has elected to terminate in its entirety the Sanofi Agreement. The termination of the Sanofi Agreement will be effective no later than May 8, 2017, or the Termination Date, which is six months from the date of the notice.
As a result, the research term for the second indication (celiac disease) will expire on the Termination Date. Under the Sanofi Agreement, each party is responsible for its own internal costs, as well as any third‑party or out‑of‑pocket costs incurred in the performance of the activities laid out in the research plan.
Pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi paid us an initial payment of $2.0 million and an additional payment of $3.0 million during preclinical research for the initial indication (peanut allergy) and an additional $3.0 million for the second indication 
48

(celiac disease), for total aggregate payments by Sanofi to us of $8.0 million. If Sanofi had not elected to terminate the Sanofi Agreement, we would have been eligible to receive additional development-based, regulatory-based and sales-based milestone payments and tiered royalties on net sales of any approved product generated by the collaboration.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sanofi Agreement, all rights granted to Sanofi will terminate and revert to us effective on the Termination Date, and Sanofi is required to grant us a royalty bearing, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain Sanofi intellectual property solely to the extent necessary to research, develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, import, export and otherwise commercialize the vaccine candidates developed under the Sanofi Agreement. We exercised our right to acquire the development programs under the Sanofi Agreement, and will be solely responsible for performing and funding any development and clinical trial activities relating to further development of vaccine candidates that it chooses to undertake after the Termination Date.
Except as authorized by Sanofi or permitted under the Sanofi Agreement, during the term of the Sanofi Agreement, exclusivity obligations prevent us from researching, developing, or commercializing products in these indications or granting third party licenses under the intellectual property rights and technologies licensed to Sanofi for use in these indications. The exclusivity obligations discussed above will also expire on the Termination Date.
Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
In May 2014, we entered into a license agreement with 3SBio, which we refer to as the 3SBio License. Pursuant to the 3SBio License, we were granted an exclusive license to certain pegsiticase-related patents and related “know-how” owned or in-licensed by 3SBio for the worldwide (except for Greater China and Japan) development and commercialization of products based thereupon for human therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic use. We are also granted a worldwide (except for Greater China) exclusive license to develop, commercialize and manufacture or have manufactured products combining our proprietary SVP technology with pegsiticase or related compounds supplied by 3SBio (or otherwise supplied if our rights to manufacture are in effect) for human therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic use. We were also granted a co-exclusive license to manufacture and have manufactured pegsiticase and related compounds for our preclinical and clinical use or, if the 3SBio License is terminated for 3SBio’s material breach, for any use under the 3SBio License. Otherwise, we are obligated to obtain all of our supply of such compounds for Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial use from 3SBio under the terms of supply agreements to be negotiated.
Pursuant to the 3SBio License, we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product containing pegsiticase or a related compound. If we do not commercialize any such product in a particular country in Asia, Africa or South America within 48 months after approval of any such product in the United States or a major European country, then 3SBio will have the right to do so, but only until we commercialize a product combining our SVP technology with any such compound in such country. Under the 3SBio License we have paid to 3SBio an aggregate of $1.0 million in upfront and milestone-based payments and recognized an additional payable during 2016 totaling $2.0 million. We are required to make future payments to 3SBio contingent upon the occurrence of events related to the achievement of clinical and regulatory approval milestones of up to an aggregate of $21.0 million for products containing our SVP technology, and up to an aggregate of $41.5 million for products without our SVP technology. We are also required to pay 3SBio tiered royalties on annual worldwide net sales (on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis) related to the pegsiticase component of products at percentages ranging from the low-to-mid single digits for products containing our SVP technology, and a range of no more than ten percentage points from the mid-single digits to low double-digits for products without our SVP technology. We will pay these royalties to 3SBio, subject to specified reductions, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of (i) the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired in that country, or (ii) a specified number of years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
The 3SBio License expires on the date of expiration of all of our royalty payment obligations unless earlier terminated by either party for an uncured material default or for the other party’s bankruptcy. Any such termination by 3SBio for our material default may be on a country-by country or product-by-product basis in certain circumstances. We may also terminate the 3SBio License on a country-by-country or product-by-product basis for any reason effective upon 60 days‘prior written notice to 3SBio or, with respect to a given product, immediately upon written notice to 3SBio if we identify a safety or efficacy concern related to such product.
BIND
In December 2008, we entered into a cross-license agreement with BIND Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly BIND Biosciences, Inc.), or BIND, which we refer to as the BIND Agreement. Pursuant to the BIND Agreement, BIND granted us a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free worldwide non-exclusive license under certain of BIND’s existing and future patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products and services covered by such patents and patent applications in the field of certain prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. The time period for adding new patent rights, not included in the families of 
49

previously licensed patent rights, to our license grant from BIND has expired. Pursuant to the BIND Agreement, we granted BIND a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide non-exclusive license under certain of our current and future patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products and services covered by such patents and patent applications in all other fields, in each case, excluding certain future patent rights of each party related to novel targeting agents. The time period for adding new patent rights, not included in the families of previously licensed patent rights, to BIND’s license grant from us has expired.
We have paid BIND an upfront license issuance fee and reimbursed certain of BIND’s fees in connection with the entry into the BIND Agreement. No royalties or other payments are due to or by either party. The BIND Agreement expires upon expiration of the last patent right covered by the BIND Agreement. Neither party may unilaterally terminate the BIND Agreement for any reason. If either party materially breaches the BIND Agreement, fails to expend a specified amount in research and development activities related to the BIND Agreement, undergoes bankruptcy or insolvency, or undergoes a change of control, the future patent rights to be included in the license grant to the party breaching, failing to expend such amounts or undergoing such event under the BIND Agreement will no longer be granted to the breaching party.
In connection with BIND’s entry into bankruptcy proceeding in 2016, Pfizer purchased substantially all of the assets of BIND, including those pertaining to the BIND Agreement.
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary
In May 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and The Schepens Eye Research Institute, Inc., or, collectively, MEE, which we refer to as the MEE License. Under the MEE License, we were granted an exclusive commercial worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers, to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import certain products and to practice certain processes, the sale, use or practice of which are covered by patents and proprietary know-how owned or controlled by MEE, for use of Anc80 gene therapy vectors for gene augmentation therapies expressing certain target sequences.
MEE also granted us exclusive options to exclusively license certain of their intellectual property rights relating to several additional target sequences and variations thereof each linked to a specified disease. During a defined option period, we may exercise this right for up to a designated number of target sequences. If we exercise our options, under certain circumstances, we may substitute alternative target sequences for previously selected target sequences.
We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products pursuant to a development plan, and to market and sell at least one product for each target sequence for which we exercised our option as soon as reasonably practicable. Subject to certain exceptions, following commercial launch we must use commercially reasonable efforts to market, sell, and maintain public availability of licensed products in a certain number of specified major markets.
Pursuant to the MEE Agreement, we agreed to pay MEE a license fee in the low six figures, annual license maintenance fees ranging from the mid-twenty thousands to mid-seventy thousands and an option maintenance fee in the low five figures for each exercisable option. We also agreed to reimburse MEE for a specified percentage of the past patent expenses for the patents licensed to us. We also agreed to pay development milestones on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, totaling up to an aggregate of between $4.2 million to $37.0 million and sales milestones on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, totaling up to an aggregate of between $50.0 million to $70.0 million; tiered royalties on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis equal to a percentage of net sales ranging from mid-single digits to mid-teens, subject to the prevalence of the targeted disease and certain reductions; and a percentage, in a range expected to be in the mid-teens depending on timing, of any sublicense income we receive from sublicensing our rights granted thereunder, subject to certain reductions and exclusions. Upon exercise of each option, we agreed to pay MEE an option exercise fee ranging from low-six figures to mid-six figures, depending on the prevalence of the targeted disease.
The MEE License will continue until the expiration of the last to expire of the patent rights licensed thereunder. We may terminate the MEE License in whole or in part upon prior written notice. MEE may terminate the MEE License on a target sequence-by-target sequence basis if we fail to make any scheduled payments in respect of such target sequence or if we materially breach a diligence obligation in respect of such target sequence, in each case if we fail to cure within a specified time period. MEE may terminate the MEE License in its entirety if we materially breach certain of our obligations related to diligence, representations and warranties, and maintenance of insurance; if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any patents licensed thereunder; if any of our executive officers are convicted of a felony relating to manufacture, use, sale or importation of licensed products; or upon our insolvency or bankruptcy.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We endeavor to protect our SVP based immunotherapy program technology, which we consider fundamental to our business, by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, relating to our 
50

program, product candidates, their methods of use and the processes for their manufacture. Our practice is to strive to protect our intellectual property by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, programs and product candidates that are commercially important to the operation and growth of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, programs and product candidates, continuing innovation and in-licensing opportunities to maintain, advance and fortify our proprietary position in our SVP-based immunotherapy program and product candidates. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our program technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
We have developed and in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our SVP-based immunotherapy technology, program and product candidates. Our patent portfolio contains nine issued patents in the United States and seven foreign issued patents, in all cases, owned solely by us. We also have 50 pending patent applications in the United States as well as 307 foreign pending patent applications, in all cases, owned solely by us. These patents and patent applications include claims directed to:

• | tolerance and cancer immunotherapy programs;


• | other immune stimulation programs;


• | methods and compositions incorporating our proprietary SVP nanoparticle in a variety of tolerance applications, including:


• | mitigating or treating anti-drug antibodies association with protein drugs (such as SEL-212), and


• | genetic therapies (such as viral delivery of genes);


• | development and commercialization of SEL-212, including both composition of matter and method of treatment claims (there are three patent families that cover the SEL-212 product, one of which is a licensed, issued U.S. patent that covers the SEL-212 product, which expires in 2021); and


• | methods and compositions incorporating our proprietary SVP nanoparticle in a variety of cancer immunotherapy applications, including:


• | creating various cancer vaccines, and


• | combination treatments, including co-treatment with PD-1/PDL-1 checkpoint inhibitors.

Set forth below is a table indicating the expiration dates for our owned patent families, or expected expiration dates in the case of our owned patent application families, corresponding to each of our programs.

(1) | Reflects number of relevant patent and patent application families.


(2) | Reflects expiration date and estimated expiration date ranges of issued patents and patent applications, respectively.

In addition, we have exclusively or non-exclusively licensed intellectual property, including the following patent portfolio: 18 U.S. issued patents; 16 foreign issued patents; 9 U.S. pending patent applications; and 56 foreign pending applications. The licensed patents and patent applications cover various aspects of the technology being developed by us, including claims directed to compositions of matter and methods of use, and have been filed in various countries worldwide including in North America, Europe and Asia, with material expiration dates varying from 2021 to, if claims are issued, 2028.
As we continue to develop the SVP-based immunotherapy program technology, we intend to pursue, when possible, patent protection for product candidates, methods of use and processes for manufacture. We continually evaluate and enhance our intellectual property strategy as we develop new program technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file analogous patent applications in the European Union and in additional foreign countries where we believe such filing 
51

is likely to be beneficial, including but not limited to Australia, Brazil, China, and Eurasia, including the Russian Federation, Europe, South Korea, Mexico, India, Israel and Japan.
Each patent’s term depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. The patent term in most countries in which we file is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. Notably, the term of U.S. patents may be extended due to delays incurred due to compliance with FDA or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the USPTO. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, depending upon the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. There is a limit to the amount of time a patent may be extended in the United States; no patent extension can extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar patent term extensions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions for patents that cover regulatory-approved drugs. We intend to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering our product candidates if and when they receive FDA approval. We expect to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Currently, we own or license patents with material expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2032. If patents are issued on pending patent applications that we own or license, the resulting patents are expected to have material expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2035. However, the actual patent protection period varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Generally, the patent positions of companies similar to ours are uncertain and encompass complex legal and factual questions. There has been no consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy in the United States The foreign patent situation is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in the United States and other countries may lessen our ability to protect our intellectual property and enforce our proprietary rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. Specifically, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our program technology, inventions and improvements. With respect to both company-owned and in-licensed intellectual property, we cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially beneficial in protecting our programs and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture those programs and product candidates. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our programs or product candidates. The field of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented immunotherapy technology, programs and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could inhibit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related programs or product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our immunotherapy technology, programs and product candidates. Additionally, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. Consequently, we may have competition for our immunotherapy technology, programs and product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any economic advantage of the patent. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, programs and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk factors-Risks related to our intellectual property.”
We currently have three trademark registrations, one in the United States, one in Europe and one in Russia. We intend to file applications for trademark registrations in connection with our product candidates in various jurisdictions, including the United States.
We may also rely on trade secrets to protect our confidential and proprietary information. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we seek to protect our program technology and product candidates as trade secrets, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors, third parties may independently discover substantially equivalent trade secrets or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. It is our policy to require our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or 
52

financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
We also seek to protect the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
COMPETITION
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our SVP technology, our expertise in triggering antigen-specific immune responses, integrated research, clinical and manufacturing capabilities, development experience, scientific knowledge and portfolio strategy provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of SEL-212, and any other tolerance or immune stimulation product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic or biosimilar products. SEL-212 may compete with others in the gout market, including Krystexxa, which contains a pegylated uricase similar to the Pegsiticase component of SEL-212 and is indicated for the treatment of refractory gout. Horizon Pharma plc, whose affiliates recently acquired Krystexxa, may find other approaches to eliminate undesired immunogenicity to Krystexxa. Long-term treatment with global immunosuppressive products may increase the susceptibility to contract infections, tumors and may lead to organ failure. Large companies with active research to prevent the formation of ADAs and treat allergies or autoimmune diseases include Sanofi, Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, and Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck. Small, early-stage biopharmaceutical companies active in the research for new technologies to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance include Anokion SA, AnTolRx Inc., Apitope International NV, Caladrius Biosciences, Cour Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc., Evotec AG, Dendright International, Inc., Parvus Therapeutics Inc., Tolerion Inc., Txcell SA, We believe that desensitization strategies are restricted to allergies, take more time to achieve a therapeutic effect than therapies that use an immuno-modulator and are more restricted in breadth of efficacy and applications than SVP products.
Our immunostimulatory therapies are also subject to intense competition. In cancer therapy, the most common methods of treating patients are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Large pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca PLC, or AstraZeneca, Roche Holding AG, Pfizer, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and Amgen Inc., as well as smaller biopharmaceutical companies including Immune Design Corp. are active in the research and development of cancer vaccines. There are a variety of vaccine approaches to treat HPV-associated cancer including the use of DNA vaccines, novel adjuvants, novel antigens and novel delivery vectors for the antigen. Clinical-stage companies with these approaches include, among others, Advaxis, in Phase 3 clinical development with Axalimogene Filolisbac; Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in Phase 2 clinical development with VGX3100; ISA Pharmaceuticals, B.V., in Phase 2 clinical 
53

development with ISA-101; and AstraZeneca, in Phase 2 clinical development with Axalimogene Filolisbac, which it licensed from Advaxis, and in Phase 1/2 clinical development with INO-3112, which it licensed from Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We believe that our approach shares the safety of approved vaccine technologies that use antigens and adjuvants and could be synergistic with the use of checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors.
We are also competing in the development of new prophylactic vaccines with large pharmaceutical companies such as Sanofi, Pfizer, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca and smaller biopharmaceutical companies such as Genocea Biosciences, Inc. and Novavax Inc.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our most advanced product candidate, SEL-212, is subject to regulation in the United States as a combination product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our SEL-212, we believe that the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product. In the case of SEL-212, which we believe will be regulated as a therapeutic biologic, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development. The CDER currently has regulatory responsibility, including premarket review and continuing oversight, over certain therapeutic biologic products that were previously regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. We expect to seek approval of SEL-212 through a single Biologics License Application, or BLA, reviewed by CDER, and we do not expect that the FDA will require a separate marketing authorization for each constituent of SEL-212.
Biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. SEL-212 and any other product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
U.S. biological products development process
The process required by the FDA before a biologic, including a gene therapy, may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive nonclinical testing, sometimes referred to as preclinical testing, including laboratory tests, animal trials and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for humane use of laboratory animals;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.

Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the 
54

FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, patient selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor patient safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to expected benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study patient or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase I. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 


• | Phase II. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 


• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labelling. 

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing 
55

control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Gene therapies
In addition to the IND submission process, sponsors of certain clinical studies of cells containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including human gene transfer studies, must comply with the National Institutes of Health’s, or NIH’s, Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (“NIH Guidelines”). The NIH Guidelines set forth the principles and requirements for NIH and institutional oversight of research with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including the standards for investigators and institutions to follow to ensure the safe handling and containment of such molecules. In April 2016, modifications to the NIH Guidelines went into effect, pursuant to which only a subset of human gene transfer protocols are subject to review by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee that provides recommendations regarding research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Specifically, under the modified NIH Guidelines, RAC review of the protocol will be required only in exceptional cases where (a) an oversight body such as an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, which provides local review and oversight of research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or an IRB determines that the protocol would significantly benefit from RAC review, and (b) the protocol (i) uses a new vector, genetic material, or delivery methodology that represents a first-in-human experience and thus presents an unknown risk, and/or (ii) relies on preclinical safety data that were obtained using a new preclinical model system of unknown and unconfirmed value, and/or (iii) involves a proposed vector, gene construct, or method of delivery associated with possible toxicities that are not widely known and that may render it difficult for oversight bodies to evaluate the protocol rigorously. The RAC review proceedings are public, and reports are posted publicly to the website for the NIH’s Office of Biotechnology Activities. Although compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for research conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Independent of RAC review, the NIH Guidelines also require all human gene transfer protocols subject to the NIH Guidelines to be registered with NIH, with limited exemptions. A study subject to the NIH Guidelines may not begin until the IBC approves the protocol, and the IBC cannot approve the protocol until confirmation from the NIH that such registration is complete. In the event that RAC review is warranted, the protocol registration process cannot be completed until RAC review has taken place.
U.S. review and approval processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is patient to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, 
56

typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant interprets the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months from the filing date and 90% of priority BLAs in six months from the filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Orphan designation
The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
We have not requested orphan designation for our product candidates, but depending on the proposed indication for which we intend to develop our future products, we may in the future request such designation.
57

Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request that the FDA designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
In addition, under the provisions of FDASIA, the FDA established a Breakthrough Therapy Designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and FDA will either grant or deny the request.
Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if we receive one of these designations for our product candidates, the FDA may later decide that our product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage.
Post-approval requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects and reporting updated safety and efficacy information.
We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labelling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market 
58

as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Biosimilars and exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, only four biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, although numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for certain biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Government regulation outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial 
59

authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
There are two types of MAs.

• | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, which is similar to the U.S. BLA. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no marketing authorization application shall be accepted and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
60

The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if the:

• | second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;


• | applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or


• | applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other healthcare laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., off-label) uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed 
61

under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year and up to an aggregate of $1,105,241 per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of pricing information and marketing expenditure as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to, as well as imposed certain other privacy obligations on, “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Coverage and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate 
62

reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
Healthcare reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and imposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices, which was suspended from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017, by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, but will be reinstated starting January 1, 2018, absent further action.
We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.
We also expect that the new presidential administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. In January 2017, the House and Senate passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the ACA and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate. President Trump has also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration’s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the ACA and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the burdensome provisions of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump’s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced 
63

Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. For example, the 21st Century Cures Act changes the reimbursement methodology for infusion drugs and biologics furnished through durable medical equipment in an attempt to remedy over- and underpayment of certain drugs.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
EMPLOYEES
As of January 31, 2017, we had 66 full-time employees, 49 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities. A total of 33 employees have either one or both an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.
