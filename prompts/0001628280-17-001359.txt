ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General 
We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company focused on the exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production of natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil in the United States. Our principal properties are located in the Utica Shale primarily in Eastern Ohio and along the Louisiana Gulf Coast in the West Cote Blanche Bay, or WCBB, and Hackberry fields. In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase oil and natural gas assets including 46,400 net surface acres with multiple producing zones, including the Woodford and Springer formations, in Grady, Stephens, and Garvin counties, Oklahoma, (see "- Our Pending Acquisition" below) which we expect to complete in February 2017. In addition, we have an interest in producing properties in the Niobrara Formation of Northwestern Colorado and the Bakken Formation. We also hold a significant acreage position in the Alberta oil sands in Canada through our interest in Grizzly Oil Sands ULC, or Grizzly, and an interest in an entity that operates in the Phu Horm gas field in Thailand. We also hold an approximate 24.2% equity interest in Mammoth Energy Services, Inc., or Mammoth Energy, an oil field services company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, to which we contributed our membership interest in Mammoth Partners LLC (previously, Mammoth Energy Partners LP) in connection with Mammoth Energy’s initial public offering completed on October 19, 2016. We seek to achieve reserve growth and increase our cash flow through our annual drilling programs.
 As of February 10, 2017, we held leasehold interests in approximately 232,000 gross (213,000 net) acres in the Utica Shale primarily in Eastern Ohio. We spud our first well, the Wagner 1-28H, on our Utica Shale acreage in February 2012 and, as of December 31, 2016, had spud 268 gross wells, 219 of which were completed and were producing. In 2016, we spud 50 gross (43.5 net) wells, of which 16 were completed as producing wells, two were non-productive, and as of December 31, 2016, 26 were in various stages of completion and six were still being drilled. We commenced sales from 54 gross wells (40.2 net wells) in the Utica Shale during 2016. During 2017 (through February 10, 2017), we spud ten gross (9.2 net) wells. As of February 10, 2017, four of these wells were waiting on completion and the other six were still drilling. In addition, other operators drilled 35 gross (6.9 net) wells and commenced sales from 25 gross (6.3 net) wells on our Utica Shale acreage in 2016. 
We currently intend to drill 87 to 97 gross (67 to 74 net) horizontal wells, and commence sales from 72 to 80 gross (61 to 67 net) horizontal wells on our Utica Shale acreage in 2017. We currently anticipate 30 to 34 gross (10 to 11 net) horizontal wells will be drilled, and sales commenced from 42 to 46 gross (nine to 10 net) horizontal wells, by other operators on our Utica Shale acreage. We currently expect our anticipated operated and non-operated activity during 2017 to cost us $645.0 million to $690.0 million. 
Aggregate net production from our Utica Shale acreage during the three months ended December 31, 2016 was approximately 70,653 net million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent, or MMcfe, or 768.0 MMcfe per day, of which 89% was from natural gas and 11% was from oil and natural gas liquids, or NGLs.

Utica Shale (primarily in Eastern Ohio)
Location and Land 
As of December 31, 2016, we held leasehold interests in approximately 232,000 gross (213,000 net) acres in the Utica Shale. 
Area History 
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources reported that in the Utica Shale in Ohio, as of December 31, 2016, there were 1,472 producing horizontal wells, 256 horizontal wells that had been drilled but were not yet completed or connected to a pipeline, 19 horizontal wells that were being drilled and an additional 460 horizontal wells that had been permitted.
Geology 
The Utica Shale is located in the Appalachian Basin of the United States and Canada. The Utica Shale is a rock unit comprised of organic-rich calcareous black shale that was deposited about 440 million to 460 million years ago during the Late Ordovician period. It overlies the Trenton Limestone and is located a few thousand feet below the Marcellus Shale.
Recently, the application of horizontal drilling, combined with multi-staged hydraulic fracturing to create permeable flow paths from shale units into wellbores, has resulted in increased drilling activity and production in the Devonian-age Marcellus Shale and the Ordovician-age Utica Shale in the Appalachian Basin states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Southern New York and Eastern Ohio. This proven technology has potential for application in other shale units which extend across much of the Appalachian Basin region.
The Utica Shale is estimated to be thicker and more geographically extensive than the Marcellus Shale. The source rock portion of the Utica Shale underlies portions of Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia in the United States and is also present beneath parts of Lake Ontario, Lake Erie and Ontario, Canada. Throughout this area, the Utica Shale ranges in thickness from less than 100 feet to over 500 feet. There is a general thinning from east to west.
The Utica Shale is also significantly deeper than the Marcellus Shale. In some parts of Pennsylvania, the Utica Shale is estimated to be over two miles below sea level and up to 7,000 feet below the Marcellus Shale. However, the depth of the Utica Shale decreases to the west into Ohio and to the northwest under the Great Lakes and into Canada to less than 2,000 feet below sea level.
The Utica Shale is estimated to have higher carbonate and lower clay mineral content than the Marcellus Shale. The difference in mineralogy generally produces a different response to hydraulic fracturing treatments. Operators in the Utica play continue to refine completions techniques to optimize productivity.
Facilities 
There are standard land oil and natural gas processing facilities in the Utica Shale. Our facilities located at well site pads include storage tank batteries, oil/gas/water separation equipment, vapor recovery units, line heaters, compression emission control devices and applicable metering. 
Recent and Future Activities 
We spud our first well, the Wagner 1-28H, on our Utica Shale acreage in February 2012 and, as of December 31, 2016, had spud 268 gross wells, 219 of which were completed and were producing. In 2016, we spud 50 gross (43.5 net) wells, of which 16 were completed as producing wells and two were non-productive, and as of December 31, 2016, 26 were in various stages of completion and six were still being drilled. We commenced sales from 54 gross wells (40.2 net wells) in the Utica Shale during 2016. During 2017 (through February 10, 2017), we spud ten gross (9.2 net) wells. As of February 10, 2017, four of these

wells were waiting on completion and the other six were still drilling. In addition, other operators drilled 35 gross (6.9 net) wells and commenced sales from 25 gross (6.3 net) wells on our Utica Shale acreage in 2016. 
We currently intend to drill 87 to 97 gross (67 to 74 net) horizontal wells, and commence sales from 72 to 80 gross (61 to 67 net) horizontal wells, on our Utica Shale acreage in 2017. We currently anticipate 30 to 34 gross (10 to 11 net) horizontal wells will be drilled, and sales commenced from 42 to 46 gross (nine to 10 net) horizontal wells, by other operators on our Utica Shale acreage during 2017. We currently anticipate our 2017 capital expenditures to be $645.0 million to $690.0 million related to our operated and non-operated Utica Shale activities. As of February 10, 2017, we had six operated horizontal rigs drilling in the play. 
Production Status
Aggregate net production from our Utica Shale acreage during the three months ended December 31, 2016 was approximately 70,653 net million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent, or MMcfe, or 768.0 MMcfe per day, of which 89% was from natural gas and 11% was from oil and natural gas liquids. 
West Cote Blanche Bay Field 
Location and Land 
The WCBB field is located approximately five miles off the coast of Louisiana in a shallow bay with water depths averaging eight to ten feet. We own a 100% working interest (80.108% net revenue interest, or NRI), and are the operator, in depths above the base of the 13900 Sand which is located at 11,320 feet. In addition, we own a 40.40% non-operated working interest (29.95% NRI) in depths below the base of the 13900 Sand, which is operated by Chevron Corporation. Our leasehold interests at WCBB contain 5,668 gross acres. 
Area History and Production 
Texaco, now Chevron Corporation, drilled the discovery well in this field in 1940 based on a seismic and gravitational anomaly. WCBB was subsequently developed on an even 160-acre pattern for much of the remainder of the decade. Developmental drilling continued and reached its peak in the 1970s when over 300 wells were drilled in the field. Of the 1,077 wells drilled as of December 31, 2016, 973 were completed as producing wells. From the date of our acquisition of WCBB in 1997 through December 31, 2016, we drilled 265 new wells, 233 of which were productive, for an 88% success rate. As of December 31, 2016, estimated field cumulative gross production was 199 MMBO and 237.2 Bcf of gas. Of the 1,077 wells drilled in WCBB as of December 31, 2016, 116 were producing, 145 were shut-in, and six were being used as salt water disposal wells. The other 810 wells have been plugged and abandoned. 
Geology 
WCBB overlies one of the largest salt dome structures on the Gulf Coast. The field is characterized by a piercement salt dome, which created traps from the Pleistocene through the Miocene formations. The relative movements affected deposition and created a complex system of fault traps. The compensating fault sets generally trend northwest to southeast and are intersected by sets having a major radial component. Later-stage movement caused extension over the dome and a large graben system (a downthrown area bounded by normal faults) was formed. 
There are over 100 distinct sandstone reservoirs recognized throughout most of the field, and nearly 200 major and minor discrete intervals have been tested. Within the 1,077 wells that had been drilled in the field as of December 31, 2016, over 4,000 potential zones have been penetrated. These sands are highly porous and permeable reservoirs primarily with a strong water drive. 
WCBB is a structurally and stratigraphically complex field. All of the proved undeveloped, or PUD, locations at WCBB are adjacent to faults and abut at least one fault. Our drilling programs are designed to penetrate each PUD trap with a new wellbore in a structurally optimum position, usually very close to the fault seal. The majority of these wells have been, and new wells drilled in connection with our drilling programs will be, directionally drilled using steering tools and downhole motors. The tolerance for error in getting near the fault is low, so the complex faulting does introduce the risk of crossing the fault before encountering the zone of interest, which could result in part or all of the zone being absent in the borehole. This, in turn, can result in lower than expected or no reserves for that zone. The new wellbores eliminate the mechanical risk associated with trying to produce the zone from an old existing wellbore, while the wellbore locations are selected in an effort to more

efficiently drain each reservoir. The vast majority of the PUD targets are up-dip offsets to wells that produced from a sub-optimal position within a particular zone. 
Facilities 
We own and operate a production facility at WCBB that includes four production tank batteries, seven natural gas compressors, a storage barge facility, a dock, a dehydration unit and a salt water disposal system.
Recent Activity 
In 2016, at our WCBB field, we recompleted 54 gross and net wells and spud no new wells. As of February 10, 2017, we had recompleted 14 gross and net wells during 2017 in our WCBB field. 
Production Status 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, our net production at WCBB was approximately 1,272 MMcfe, or an average of 13.8 MMcfe per day, of which 99% was from oil and 1% was from natural gas. 
East Hackberry Field 
Location and Land 
The East Hackberry field in Louisiana is located along the western shore and the land surrounding Lake Calcasieu, 15 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. We own a 100% working interest (approximately 82.04% average NRI) in certain producing oil and natural gas properties situated in the East Hackberry field. As of December 31, 2016, we held beneficial interests in approximately 4,116 acres, including the Erwin Heirs Block, which is located on land, and the adjacent State Lease 50 Block, which is located primarily in the shallow waters of Lake Calcasieu. 
Area History and Production 
The East Hackberry field was discovered in 1926 by Gulf Oil Company, now Chevron Corporation, by a gravitational anomaly survey. The massive shallow salt stock presented an easily recognizable gravity anomaly indicating a productive field. Initial production began in 1927 and has continued to the present. The estimated cumulative oil and condensate production through 2016 was over 4,758 MBO and 332 Bcf of casinghead gas production. A total of 269 wells have been drilled on our portion of the field. As of December 31, 2016, 25 wells had daily production, 119 were shut-in and three had been converted to salt water disposal wells. The remaining 122 wells had been plugged and abandoned. 
Geology 
The Hackberry field is a major salt intrusive feature, elliptical in shape as opposed to a classic “dome,” divided into east and west field entities by a saddle. Structurally, our East Hackberry acreage is located on the eastern end of the Hackberry salt ridge. There are over 30 pay zones at this field. The salt intrusion formed a series of structurally complex and steeply dipping fault blocks in the Lower Miocene and Oligocene age rocks. These fault blocks serve as traps for hydrocarbon accumulation. Our wells currently produce from perforations found between 5,100 and 12,200 feet. 
Facilities 
We have a field office that serves both the East and West Hackberry fields. In addition, we own and operate three production facilities at East Hackberry that include two land based tank batteries, a production barge, three natural gas compressors, dehydration units and salt water disposal systems. 
Recent Activity 
During 2016 at East Hackberry, we recompleted 23 gross and net wells and spud no new wells. As of February 10, 2017, we had recompleted two gross and net wells during 2017 in our East Hackberry field.

Index to Financial Statements

Production Status 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, our net production at East Hackberry was approximately 334 MMcfe, or an average of 3.6 MMcfe per day, of which 97% was from oil and 3% was from natural gas. 
West Hackberry Field 
Location and Land 
The West Hackberry field is located on land and is five miles west of Lake Calcasieu in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, approximately 85 miles west of Lafayette and 15 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. We own a 100% working interest (approximately 80.00% NRI) in 1,032 acres within the West Hackberry field. Our leases at West Hackberry are located within two miles of one of the United States Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserves. 
Area History 
The first discovery well at West Hackberry was drilled in 1938 and the field was developed by Superior Oil Company, now ExxonMobil Corporation, between 1938 and 1988. The estimated cumulative oil and condensate production through 2016 was 493 MBO and 140 Bcf of natural gas. As of December 31, 2016, 41 wells had been drilled on our portion of West Hackberry. As of December 31, 2016, seven of such wells were producing, six were shut-in and one had been converted to a saltwater disposal well. The remaining 27 wells have been plugged and abandoned. 
Geology 
Structurally, our West Hackberry acreage is located on the western end of the Hackberry salt ridge. There are over 30 pay zones at this field. West Hackberry consists of a series of fault-bounded traps in the Oligocene-age Vincent and Keough sands associated with the Hackberry Salt Ridge. Recoveries from these thick, porous, water-drive reservoirs have resulted in per well cumulative production of almost 700 MBOE. 
Recent Activity 
During 2016 at West Hackberry, we had no recompletions and spud no new wells. 
Production Status 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, our net production at West Hackberry was approximately 45 MMcfe, or an average of 492.8 Mcfe per day, of which 99% was from oil and 1% was from natural gas. 
Facilities 
We own and operate a production facility at West Hackberry that includes a land based tank battery and salt water disposal system. 
Niobrara Formation (Northwestern Colorado) 
Location and Land 
Effective as of April 1, 2010, we acquired leasehold interests in the Niobrara Formation in Northwestern Colorado and, as of December 31, 2016, we held leases for approximately 4,000 net acres. In 2016, no wells were spud on our Niobrara Formation acreage. 
Area History 
The Niobrara Formation is a shale oil rock formation located in Colorado, Northwest Kansas, Southwest Nebraska, and Southeast Wyoming. Oil and natural gas can be found at depths of 3,000 to 14,000 feet and is drilled both vertically and horizontally. The Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Formation has emerged as another potential crude oil resource play in various basins throughout the northern Rocky Mountain region. As with most resource plays, the Niobrara Formation has a history of producing through conventional technology with some of the earliest production dating back to the early 1900s. Natural

fracturing has played a key role in producing the Niobrara Formation historically due to the low porosity and low permeability of the formation. Because of this, conventional production has been very localized and limited in area extent. We believe the Niobrara Formation can be produced on a more widespread basis using today's horizontal multi-stage fracture stimulation technology where the Niobrara Formation is thermally mature. 
Geology 
The Niobrara Formation oil play in Northwestern Colorado is located between the Piceance Basin to the south and the Sand Wash Basin to the north. Rocks mainly consist of interbedded organic-rich shales, calcareous shales and marlstones. It is the fractured marlstone intervals locally known as the Buck Peak, Tow Creek and Wolf Mountain benches that account for the majority of the area's production. These fractured carbonate reservoirs are associated with anticlinal, synclinal and monoclinal folds, and fault zones. This proven oil accumulation is considered to be continuous in nature and lightly explored. Source rocks are predominantly oil prone and thermally mature with respect to oil generation. The producing intervals are geologically equivalent to the Niobrara Formation reservoirs of the DJ and Powder River Basins, which are currently emerging as a major crude resource play. 
Production Status 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, net production from our Niobrara Formation acreage was approximately 26 MMcfe, or an average of 277.8 Mcfe per day, 100% of which was from oil. 
Facilities 
There are typical land oil and natural gas processing facilities in the Niobrara Formation. Our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries, oil/gas/water separation equipment and pumping units. 
Recent Activity 
There were no new wells drilled on our Niobrara Formation acreage in 2016. We do not anticipate drilling any wells in the Niobrara Formation during 2017.
Bakken Formation 
Location and Land 
The Bakken Formation is located in the Williston Basin areas of Western North Dakota and Eastern Montana. As of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 778 net acres, interests in 18 wells and overriding royalty interests in certain existing and future wells. 
Production Status 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, our net production from this acreage was approximately 71 MMcfe, or an average of 773.5 Mcfe per day, of which 80% was from oil, 16% was from natural gas and 4% was from natural gas liquids.

Our Pending Acquisition
We have entered into a purchase agreement, dated as of December 13, 2016, with Vitruvian II Woodford, LLC, an unrelated third-party seller, referred to herein as the Seller or Vitruvian, to acquire certain assets of the Seller for a total purchase price consisting of $1.35 billion in cash and approximately 23.9 million in shares of our common stock, subject to certain adjustments, which we refer to herein as the Pending Acquisition. The assets subject to the Pending Acquisition include 46,400 net surface acres, with multiple producing zones including the Woodford and Springer formations, in Grady, Stephens and Garvin Counties, Oklahoma. Given the potential for numerous producing intervals across this acreage, we have identified approximately 1,750 gross drilling locations, comprised of only Woodford and Springer zones with significant upside potential through infill drilling and additional prospective zones present on the acreage. The properties subject to the Pending Acquisition are located primarily in the over-pressured liquids-rich to dry gas windows of the SCOOP play and include approximately 183 MMcfe per day of net production for October 2016, based on information provided by the Seller. The Pending Acquisition also includes 48 producing horizontal wells and an additional interest in over 150 non-operated horizontal wells. Four rigs are currently operating on the acreage and we intend to maintain a four-rig cadence in the play during 2017. Based on the estimates prepared by the Seller as of September 30, 2016 and audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, the estimated proved reserves attributable to the acreage subject to the Pending Acquisition are approximately 1.1 Tcfe. These estimates are internal estimates prepared by the Seller, and we may revise such estimates following the completion of the Pending Acquisition. We do not currently hold any leasehold interests or have any operations in the SCOOP play. The Pending Acquisition is expected to provide basin diversification to our operations. We intend to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Pending Acquisition with the net proceeds from the December 2016 common stock and senior note offerings and cash on hand. We anticipate completing the Pending Acquisition in February 2017. However, the Pending Acquisition remains subject to completion of due diligence and satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the Pending Acquisition will be completed or that we will acquire all or any portion of the acreage subject to the Pending Acquisition. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors - Risks Relating to the Pending Acquisition."
Our Equity Investments
Grizzly Oil Sands. We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Grizzly Holdings Inc., own a 24.9% interest in Grizzly. As of December 31, 2016, Grizzly had approximately 830,000 net acres under lease in the Athabasca, Peace River and Cold Lake oil sands regions of Alberta, Canada. Grizzly has three oil sands projects in various stages of development. Grizzly commenced commercial production from its Algar Lake Phase 1 steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, oil sand project during the second quarter of 2014 and has received regulatory approval for up to 11,300 barrels per day of bitumen production. Grizzly produced approximately 900 barrels of bitumen per day at its Algar Lake SAGD project during the first quarter of 2015. In April 2015, Grizzly determined to cease bitumen production at its Algar Lake facility due to the level of commodity prices. Grizzly continues to monitor market conditions as it assesses future plans for the facility. We reviewed our investment in Grizzly as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, and again at March 31, 2016, for impairment based on FASB ASC 323-Investments: Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or FASB ASC 323, due to certain qualitative factors and engaged an independent third party to assist management in determining fair value calculations of its investment. As a result of the calculated fair values and other qualitative factors, we concluded that an other than temporary impairment was required under 
9

Index to Financial Statements

FASB ASC 323, resulting in an aggregate impairment loss of $101.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $23.1 million for the for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of and during the period ended December 31, 2016, commodity prices had increased as compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2016, and there were no impairment indicators that required further evaluation for impairment. If commodity prices decline again in the future, further impairment of our investment in Grizzly may result. In the first quarter of 2012, Grizzly acquired the May River property comprising approximately 47,000 acres. An initial 12,000 barrel per day development application was filed with the regulatory authorities in the fourth quarter of 2013, covering the eastern portion of the May River lease. The development application continues to move through the regulatory process and is expected to be approved in the first half of 2017. In the first quarter of 2014, a 2-D seismic program covering approximately 83 kilometers was completed to more fully define the resource over the remaining lease beyond the development application area. At the Thickwood thermal project, a development application for a 12,000 barrel per day oil sands project was filed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Since then, the Alberta Energy Regulator, or AER, announced it is implementing a policy for future regulatory requirements for reservoir containment in shallow SAGD areas, which impacts the Thickwood application. Additional work to advance the Thickwood application will be required and is expected to be addressed once the May River development approval is received. In December 2015, Grizzly suspended the review of the Thickwood application by the AER. The Thickwood application will be resubmitted once the regulations have been updated. Grizzly has also developed delineation drilling, seismic and regulatory work plans at its Cadotte, Peace River property. Grizzly continues to pursue a rail marketing strategy to ensure consistent and flexible access to premium markets for its production, including its Windell truck to rail terminal located near Conklin, Alberta, which commenced transloading blended bitumen production from Algar Lake on to rail cars for delivery to the US Gulf Coast markets in the second quarter of 2014.
Thailand. We own a 23.5% ownership interest in Tatex II. Tatex II, a privately held entity, holds an 8.5% interest in APICO, an international oil and gas exploration company. APICO has a reserve base located in Southeast Asia through its ownership of concessions covering approximately 180,000 acres which includes the Phu Horm Field. Our investment is accounted for on the equity method. Tatex II accounts for its investment in APICO using the cost method. In December 2006, first gas sales were achieved at the Phu Horm field located in northeast Thailand. Phu Horm's initial gross production was approximately 60 MMcf per day. For 2016, net gas production was approximately 118 MMcf per day and condensate production was 435 barrels per day. PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited operates the field with a 55% interest. Other interest owners include APICO (35% interest) and ExxonMobil (10% interest). Our gross working interest (through Tatex II as a member of APICO) in the Phu Horm field is 0.7%. Since our ownership in the Phu Horm field is indirect and Tatex II's investment in APICO is accounted for by the cost method, these reserves are not included in our year-end reserve information. 
Other Investments. In an effort to facilitate the development of our Utica Shale and other domestic acreage, we have invested in entities that can provide services that are required to support our operations. In 2012, we participated in the formation of Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC, or Stingray Pressure, and Stingray Logistics LLC, or Stingray Logistics, with an initial ownership interest in each entity of 50%. These entities provide well completion and other well services. In 2011 and 2012, we acquired an aggregate 40% equity interest in Bison Drilling and Field Services LLC, or Bison, which owns and operates drilling rigs and related equipment. Also in 2011, we acquired a 25% interest in Muskie Proppant LLC, or Muskie, which is engaged in the processing and sale of hydraulic fracturing grade sand. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we contributed our investments in Stingray Pressure, Stingray Logistics, Bison and Muskie to Mammoth Energy Partners LP, or Mammoth, in exchange for a 30.5% limited partner interest in this newly formed limited partnership. On October 19, 2016, Mammoth Energy Services, Inc., or Mammoth Energy, which is the parent company of Mammoth, completed its initial public offering, or the IPO, of 7,750,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, of which 7,500,000 shares were sold by Mammoth Energy and 250,000 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, including 76,250 shares sold by us for which we received net proceeds of $1.1 million. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we were issued 9,150,000 shares of Mammoth Energy common stock in return for the contribution of our 30.5% interest in Mammoth Energy Partners LLC (as the sucessor to Mammoth). We intend to use the net proceeds for the sale of our Mammoth Energy shares in the IPO for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2016, we owned an approximate 24.2% interest in Mammoth Energy. 
 In 2013, we participated in the formation of Stingray Energy Services LLC, or Stingray Energy, with an initial ownership interest of 50%. Stingray Energy provides rental tools for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities as well as the transfer of fresh water to wellsites. In 2012, we participated in the formation of Stingray Cementing LLC, or Stingray Cementing, with an initial ownership of 50%. Stingray Cementing provides well completion and other well services. In 2012, we also participated in the formation of Blackhawk Midstream LLC, or Blackhawk, and Timber Wolf Terminals LLC, or Timber Wolf, with an initial ownership interest of 50% in each entity. Blackhawk coordinates gathering, compression, processing and marketing activities in connection with the development of our Utica Shale acreage and Timber Wolf will operate a crude/condensate terminal and a sand transloading facility in Ohio. Also in 2012, we acquired a 22.5% equity interest in Windsor Midstream LLC, or Midstream, which owned a 28.4% equity interest in a gas processing plant in 
10

Index to Financial Statements

West Texas. In 2014, we acquired a 25% equity interest in Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC, or Sturgeon. Sturgeon owns an entity that operates sand mines that produce hydraulic fracturing grade sand. 
In February 2016, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary Gulfport Midstream Holdings, LLC, or Midstream Holdings, entered into an agreement with Rice Midstream Holdings LLC, or Rice, a subsidiary of Rice Energy Inc., to develop natural gas gathering assets in eastern Belmont County and Monroe County, Ohio, which we refer to as the dedicated areas. We own a 25% interest in the newly formed entity called Strike Force Midstream LLC, or Strike Force, and Rice acts as operator and owns the remaining 75% interest in Strike Force. Construction of the gathering assets, which is underway, is providing gathering services for an increasing number of Gulfport operated wells and connectivity of existing dry gas gathering systems and interchangeability of natural gas across our firm portfolio. The first phase of the project has been completed: a lateral that connects two existing dry gas gathering systems on which we currently flow the majority of our dry gas volumes. First flow commenced through this lateral on February 1, 2016. 
See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these other investments.
Competition 
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of industry opportunities and to withstand changes affecting the industry, such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production, the availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulation. In addition, oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas.
Marketing and Customers
The availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the demand for oil and natural gas and the level of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of gas sold in interstate commerce. The oil and natural gas we produce in Louisiana is sold to purchasers who service the areas where our wells are located. We sell the majority of our Southern Louisiana oil to Shell Trading Company, or Shell. Shell takes custody of the oil at the outlet from our oil storage barge. The majority of this production is being sold under a West Texas Intermediate crude price HLS/LLS differential less transportation costs. The majority of our Utica Shale oil is sold to Marathon Petroleum Corporation, or Marathon. The purchaser takes custody at the MarkWest Utica EMG, or MarkWest, owned and operated condensate stabilizer located near Cadiz, Ohio. Our Utica Shale NGLs are currently purchased by MarkWest which remits to us a weighted average selling price of products sold to various markets. Our Utica Shale natural gas production is sold to various purchasers through established NAESBs with the counterparties. The majority of our gas is sold to BP Energy Company, or BP. In 2016, our Utica Shale natural gas and natural gas liquids were sold under monthly, seasonal and long term contracts and, as needed, through daily transactions. The majority of our production is delivered at the tailgate of the plants or at central delivery points with market pricing based on Platts Gas Daily - Appalachian - Dominion South Point (Dominion Eastern and Dominion Transmission) or Texas Eastern M2 Zone when sold in the Utica Basin. To maintain flow assurance and price stability, and as discussed under "–Transportation and Takeaway Capacity," we have entered into agreements to transport a portion of our natural gas production out of the Utica Basin. These agreements have pricing based on the appropriate delivery point less transportation charges and fuel.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold approximately 68% and 10% of our natural gas production to BP and DTE Energy Trading, Inc., or DTE, respectively, 72% and 24% of our oil production to Shell and Marathon, respectively, and 74% and 23% of our natural gas liquids production to MarkWest and Antero Resources, or Antero, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold approximately 79% and 14% of our natural gas production to BP and DTE, respectively, 90% and 10% of our oil production to Shell and Marathon, respectively, and 76% and 24% of our natural gas liquids production to MarkWest and Antero, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold approximately 40%, 32% and 19% of our natural gas production to BP, DTE, and Hess, respectively, 99% of our oil production to Shell, 100% of our natural gas liquids production to MarkWest.

As of December 31, 2016, we had an average of approximately 516,000 MMBtu per day of firm sales contracted with third parties for 2017. We had an average of approximately 257,000 MMBtu per day, 226,000 MMBtu per day, 223,000 MMBtu per day, 126,000 MMBtu per day and 31,000 MMBtu contracted with third parties for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and thereafter, respectively. 
Transportation and Takeaway Capacity
In Ohio, as of December 31, 2016, we had entered into firm transportation contracts to deliver approximately 775,000 MMBtu to 1,125,000 MMBtu per day for 2017. For 2018 through 2020, we had entered into firm transportation contracts to deliver approximately 1,125,000 MMBtu per day. We continuously monitor the need to secure additional firm transportation contracts for incremental volumes from our Utica Shale acreage but expect additional long term contracts to be limited in 2017. Our primary long-haul firm transportation commitments include the following:

• | 520,000 MMBtu per day of firm capacity on Dominion East Ohio, which began in 2014 and allows us to reach additional connectivity to Gulf Coast and Midwest natural gas markets;

• | 100,000 MMBtu per day of firm capacity on Texas Eastern Transmission facilities expected to begin in 2017 allowing additional access to Midwest delivery points;


• | 150,000 MMBtu per day of firm capacity on Energy Transfer’s Rover Pipeline facilities expected to begin in 2017 allowing additional access to Canadian, Midwest and Gulf Coast delivery points; and


• | 100,000 MMBtu per day of firm capacity on Columbia Gulf Transmission facilities expected to begin in late 2017 allowing additional access to Gulf Coast delivery points.

Under firm transportation contracts, we are obligated to deliver minimum daily volumes or pay fees for any deficiencies in deliveries. We continue to actively identify and evaluate additional takeaway capacity to facilitate production growth in our Utica Basin position. 
Regulation 
12

Index to Financial Statements

Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production
Oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. This legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability.
We own interests in producing oil and natural gas properties located in the Utica Shale primarily in Eastern Ohio, along the Louisiana Gulf Coast and in the Niobrara Formation in Northwestern Colorado and the Bakken Formation in Western North Dakota and Eastern Montana. The states in which our fields are located regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including requirements for obtaining drilling permits, the method of developing fields and the spacing and operation of wells. In addition, regulations governing conservation matters aimed at preventing the waste of oil and natural gas resources could affect the rate of production and may include maximum daily production allowables for wells on a market demand or conservation basis.
Environmental Regulation
Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas, and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is often strict (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future.
Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent not-hazardous waste requirements. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. It has until March 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses.
Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be 
13

Index to Financial Statements

significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, generally impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several, for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released.
Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on June 28, 2016, EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants, which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “-Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.” Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions.
The OPA is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters.
Noncompliance with the Clean Water Act or the OPA may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations. We believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws.
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “-Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.” Also, on May 12, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. These laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate, and federal and state regulatory 
14

Index to Financial Statements

agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations. Obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In May 2010, the EPA adopted regulations establishing new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On August 26, 2016, the EPA proposed changes needed to bring EPA’s air permitting regulations in line with the Supreme Court’s decision on GHG permitting. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 2016 and the public comment period closed on December 2, 2016.
The EPA also adopted a GHG reporting rule in September 2009 authorizing the collection of GHG data from large emission sources across a range of industry sectors. In November 2010, the EPA expanded the GHG reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include certain of our facilities, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the GHG reporting rule to add the reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.
The EPA has continued to adopt GHG regulations applicable to other industries, such as its August 2015 adoption of three separate, but related, actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, including final Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants, a final Clean Power Plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants, and a proposed federal plan to implement the Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. Upon publication of the Clean Power Plan on October 23, 2015, more than two dozen States as well as industry and labor groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while legal challenges to the rule proceed. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties, or COP-21, of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. Also, on June 29, 2016, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico announced an Action Plan to, among other things, boost clean energy, improve energy efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Action Plan specifically calls for a reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent by 2025.
Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. Currently, while we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting requirements, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. It also remains unclear whether and how the results of the 2016 U.S. election could impact the regulation of GHG emissions at the federal and state level.
In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Moreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.
Endangered Species Act
Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act, or the ESA and analogous state statutes, may impact exploration, development and production activities on public or private lands. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the U.S., and restricts activities that may adversely affect listed species or their habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal agencies are required to insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. While some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify, however, previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, which could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements.
Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We use hydraulic fracturing extensively in the development of our Utica Shale acreage. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program, specifically as “Class II” UIC wells. 
In addition, the EPA plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by June 2018, which would describe a proposed mechanism - regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both - to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Also, on June 28, 2016, EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.
On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule package includes NSP standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in VOCs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also

establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. On the same day, the EPA finalized a plan to implement its minor new source review program on Indian lands for oil and natural gas production, and it issued for public comment an information request that will require companies to provide extensive information instrumental for the development of regulations to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.
In addition, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. On June 21, 2016, the United States District Court for Wyoming set aside the rule, holding that the BLM lacked Congressional authority to promulgate the rule. The BLM has appealed the decision to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Also, on November 15, 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule also clarifies when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. State and industry groups have challenged this rule in federal court, asserting that the BLM lacks authority to prescribe air quality regulations. Congress is currently considering whether to repeal the rule pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.
Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
Some states and local jurisdictions in which we operate or hold oil and natural gas interests have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. If new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.

Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, natural gas storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC's regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.
Although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.
Drilling and Production. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:

• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;


• | the rates of production or “allowables”;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and


• | notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill.
Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, 
18

Index to Financial Statements

decommissioning and site restoration. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements.
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation. Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Since 1978, various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales,” which include all of our sales of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties.
FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC's initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities.
Under FERC’s current regulatory regime, transmission services are provided on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at negotiated rates. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations.
Oil Sales and Transportation. Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
Our crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors.
Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines' published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.
State Regulation. The states in which we operate regulate the drilling for, and the production and gathering of, oil and natural gas, including through requirements relating to the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may also regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill.
In July 2015, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, or the ODNR, enacted a comprehensive set of rules to regulate the construction of well pads. Under these new rules, operators must submit detailed horizontal well pad site plans certified by a professional engineer for review by the ODNR Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management prior to the construction of a 
19

Index to Financial Statements

well pad. These rules will result in increased construction costs for operators. Furthermore, pursuant to new rules approved in August 2016, operators must immediately notify ODNR regarding certain oil or gas releases.
The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
Operational Hazards and Insurance
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow outs, pipe failures and, in some cases, abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury, loss of life, damage or destruction to property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations.
In accordance with what we believe to be industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We insure some, but not all, of our properties for operational and hurricane related events. We currently have insurance policies that include coverage for general liability, physical damage to our oil and natural gas properties, operational control of certain wells, oil pollution, third party liability, workers compensation and employers' liability and other coverage. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses. Any of these events could cause a significant disruption to our business. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Currently, we have general liability insurance coverage with an annual aggregate limit of up to $25.0 million which includes sudden and accidental pollution for the effects of onshore and offshore pollution on third parties arising from our operations as well as $10.0 million of gradual pollution insurance coverage. For our offshore WCBB properties, we also have a $40.0 million property physical damage policy which insures against most operational perils, such as explosions, fire, vandalism, theft, hail and windstorms, provided, however, that this policy is limited to $12.5 million for damages arising as a result of a named windstorm. All of our insurance coverage includes deductibles of up to $250,000 per occurrence ($1.25 million in the case of a named windstorm) that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to customary exclusions and limitations. We reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy terms and limits annually. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We carry control of well insurance for all of our Utica Shale wells and several Southern Louisiana wells. We also require all of our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider's employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider. 
We have prepared and have in place spill prevention control and countermeasure plans for each of our principal facilities in response to federal and state requirements. The plans are reviewed annually and updated as necessary. As required by applicable regulations, our facilities are built with secondary containment systems to capture potential releases. We also own additional spill kits with oil booms and absorbent pads that are readily available, if needed. In addition, we have emergency response companies on retainer. These companies specialize in the clean up of hydrocarbons as a result of spills, blow-outs and natural disasters, and are on call to us 24 hours a day, seven days a week when their services are needed. We pay these companies a retainer plus additional amounts when they provide us with clean up services. Our aggregate payments for the retainer and clean up services during each of 2016 and 2015 were approximately $0.1 million. While these companies have been able to meet our service needs when required from time to time in the past, it is possible that the ability of one or more of them to provide services to us in the future, if and when needed, could be hindered or delayed in the event of a widespread disaster. However, in light of the areas in which we operate and the nature of our production, we believe other companies would be available to us in the event our primary remediation companies are unable to perform. To supplement our planning and operation activities in Ohio, we also actively manage an incident response planning program and coordinate with applicable 
20

Index to Financial Statements

state agency personnel on spills and releases through Ohio's Incident Notification Hotline. We also participate in Ohio's Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) program, which includes reporting of various materials used or stored on-site as well as notification to state and local emergency response centers, such as local fire departments, for emergency planning purposes. 
Headquarters and Other Facilities 
Construction of our new corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was completed in December of 2016. The building has approximately 120,000 square feet of office space and allows us to consolidate all of our employees in one location in Oklahoma City. We also own an approximately 28,500 square foot office building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma that served as our previous corporate headquarters. We have received various offers to purchase or lease this building, which we are evaluating. 
We also own an approximately 12,500 square foot building in Lafayette, Louisiana. This building contains approximately 6,200 square feet of finished office area and 6,300 square feet of clear span warehouse area. We lease approximately 3,700 square feet in a building in Lafayette that we use as our Louisiana headquarters. In 2016, we purchased an approximately 12,300 square feet building located in St. Clairsville, Ohio to serve as our headquarters for our Ohio operations. Each of these properties is suitable and adequate for its use. 
Employees 
At December 31, 2016, we had 241 employees.
