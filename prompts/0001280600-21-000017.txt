Item 1.    Business
We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases. Our research focuses on key natural regulators of cellular growth and repair, particularly the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta, or TGF-beta, protein superfamily. By combining our discovery and development expertise, including our proprietary knowledge of the TGF-beta superfamily, and our internal protein engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we generate innovative therapeutic candidates, all of which encompass novel potential first-in-class mechanisms of action. If successful, these candidates could have the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients across these areas of high, unmet need.
We focus and prioritize our commercialization, research and development activities within two key therapeutic areas: pulmonary and hematology. 
Pulmonary
We are actively developing our lead pulmonary program, sotatercept, for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Sotatercept is generally partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb, or BMS (which acquired Celgene Corporation in November 2019), but we retain the exclusive rights to fund, develop, and lead the global commercialization of sotatercept in pulmonary hypertension, which we refer to as the PH field, and that includes PAH. PAH is a rare and chronic, rapidly progressing disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries, resulting in abnormally high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.
In June 2020, we presented results of the PULSAR Phase 2 trial of sotatercept in patients with PAH on stable background PAH-specific therapies during the "Breaking News: Clinical Trials in Pulmonary Medicine" session of the American Thoracic Society, or ATS, 2020 Virtual Conference. Study investigators reported that the trial met its primary endpoint, pulmonary vascular resistance, and its key secondary endpoint, six-minute walk distance, and showed concordance of results across multiple additional endpoints and regardless of baseline characteristics. Sotatercept was generally well tolerated in the trial and adverse events observed in the study were generally consistent with previously published data on sotatercept in clinical trials in other patient populations. We presented additional cardiac and pulmonary function data at the virtual 2020 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in November 2020 showing improvement in right ventricular-pulmonary arterial (RV-PA) coupling, which represents the match between the output of the RV and the resistance of the pulmonary vasculature, as well as improvement in RV function. The 18-month extension period of the PULSAR trial is ongoing and we initiated our registrational Phase 3 trial, the STELLAR trial, in patients with PAH at the end of 2020. In mid 2021, we also plan to initiate the early intervention Phase 3 HYPERION trial in patients with PAH, and the later intervention Phase 3 ZENITH trial in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class IV PAH patients.
We have completed enrollment in an exploratory study called SPECTRA to provide us with greater understanding of sotatercept's potential impact on PAH. We presented preliminary interim results in November 2020 at the virtual 2020 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions, and we expect to announce additional results in the first half of 2021. We also previously announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to sotatercept for the treatment of patients with PAH, and that the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has granted Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation to sotatercept for the treatment of patients with PAH. In December 2020, the European Commission granted Orphan Drug designation to sotatercept for the treatment of patients with PAH.
If sotatercept is approved and commercialized to treat PAH, then we will recognize revenue from global net sales and owe BMS a royalty in the low 20% range.
In addition to sotatercept, we are currently advancing our second pulmonary therapeutic candidate, ACE-1334. ACE-1334 is a wholly owned TGF-beta superfamily-based ligand trap designed to bind and inhibit TGF-beta 1 and 3 ligands but not TGF-beta 2. We recently completed an ascending-dose Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, and the FDA has granted Fast Track designation to ACE-1334 in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, or SSc-ILD, as well as Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of systemic sclerosis. SSc-ILD is a rare, progressive, autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by immune dysregulation. We intend to initiate a Phase 1b/Phase 2 clinical trial with ACE-1334 in patients with SSc-ILD in 2021. 
Hematology
Our first commercial product, REBLOZYL® (luspatercept-aamt), is a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent designed to promote red blood cell, or RBC, production through a novel mechanism, and is partnered with BMS. REBLOZYL is currently 
approved to treat certain adult patients with beta-thalassemia or MDS in the United States, European Union and Canada, as further described below.
For additional patient populations, BMS is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial with luspatercept-aamt in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients, referred to as the BEYOND trial, with results currently expected in the first half of 2021, and a Phase 3 clinical trial, the COMMANDS trial, in first-line, lower-risk MDS patients, with topline results expected in or after 2022. In myelofibrosis, BMS is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial with luspatercept-aamt in patients with myelofibrosis-associated anemia, and is in the process of initiating the Phase 3 INDEPENDENCE study in patients with myelofibrosis-associated anemia who are being treated with JAK inhibitor therapy and require RBC transfusions.
We believe that there is a global annual peak sales opportunity for REBLOZYL in excess of $4 billion for all currently approved indications and those in development, including future clinical development expansion. 
BMS is responsible for paying 100% of the development costs for all clinical trials for luspatercept-aamt. We may receive a maximum of $100.0 million for remaining potential regulatory and commercial milestone payments. We have a co-promotion right in North America and our commercialization costs provided in the commercialization plan and budget approved by the Joint Commercialization Committee, or JCC, are entirely funded by BMS. Activities that we elect to conduct outside of the approved development or commercialization budgets to support REBLOZYL are at our own expense. We are eligible to receive tiered royalty payments from BMS on net sales of REBLOZYL in the low-to-mid 20% range.
Funding
As of December 31, 2020 our operations have been funded primarily by $105.1 million in equity investments from venture investors, $1.3 billion from public investors, $164.1 million in equity investments from our collaboration partners and $431.7 million in upfront payments, milestones, royalties, and net research and development payments from our collaboration partners.
Our Goals and Objectives in the Year 2021

The Acceleron Discovery Platform: Novel Approaches to Potent Biology
Since our founding, we have focused on developing therapeutic candidates that regulate cellular growth and repair. We have targeted a group of approximately 30 secreted proteins, or ligands, that are collectively referred to as the TGF-beta superfamily. These ligands bind to subsets of 12 different receptors on the surface of cells, triggering intra-cellular changes in gene expression that guide cell growth and differentiation. The TGF-beta superfamily ligands and their receptors represent a diverse set of drug targets with the potential to yield potent therapeutics for the growth and repair of diseased cells and tissues. 
Applying our proprietary discovery and development platform, including our knowledge of the biology of the TGF-beta superfamily and its receptors, we have generated multiple Fc-fusion protein ligand traps, our novel IntelliTrap™ platform technology and a robust pipeline of innovative clinical and preclinical therapeutic candidates targeting key mechanisms underlying serious and rare diseases. Additionally, we are conducting a multi-target antibody discovery collaboration with Adimab LLC, or Adimab, a leading antibody discovery company, under which Adimab is generating human antibodies against undisclosed targets that we select. This collaboration could expand our biologics platform and provide us with enhanced access to antibody therapeutic candidates in the future. 
We use our integrated platform of research, development and manufacturing technologies to rapidly and cost-effectively create, test and advance our therapeutic candidates. Our leadership in the understanding of TGF-beta biology and protein engineering generates innovative compounds that engage the body's ability to regulate cellular growth and repair.
Our Pipeline
Sotatercept
Sotatercept is an activin receptor type IIA fusion protein that acts as a ligand trap for members in the TGF-beta protein superfamily involved in the remodeling of a variety of different tissues, including the vasculature and fibrotic tissue. We are currently developing sotatercept for the treatment of patients with PAH.
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)
Pulmonary hypertension is a group of diseases characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation resulting from a variety of causes. PAH is a type of pulmonary hypertension. It is a rare, chronic, rapidly progressing disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries, resulting in abnormally high blood pressure in these vessels. Patients typically present with exercise fatigue and shortness of breath. Progressive obstruction and constriction of the pulmonary vasculature leads to elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation and strain on the right side of the heart. In later stages of disease, right heart failure may develop, and heart failure is the major cause of death in PAH patients. The major classes of drugs used to treat PAH are: the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), the endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (sGCs) and the prostacyclins. Despite the availability of therapeutic options, the disease progresses rapidly and the five-year survival rate for patients is approximately 57%. All classes of currently approved therapies are designed to promote the dilation of blood vessels, a mechanism referred to as vasodilation. As evident from the 
high mortality rate, therapies that promote vasodilation improve many aspects of the disease, but do not fundamentally modify or halt the progression of the disease. Accordingly, there is significant unmet need for therapies that address more fundamental aspects of the disease.
Heritable forms of PAH are known, and the underlying genetic defects have been identified. In most cases, the underlying mutations map to a gene that encodes the BMP receptor type II (BMPRII) or genes encoding other proteins that participate in the BMPRII signaling pathway. BMPRII is a key receptor for ligands referred to as the BMPs, and these are part of the TGF-beta superfamily. The BMP-BMPRII signaling pathway activates transcription factors called Smad1/5/8 that coordinate changes in the expression of certain genes. A deficiency in BMP-BMPRII signaling, and the attendant activation of Smad1/5/8, is thought to lead to increased proliferation of cell types that line the vessels, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. This increased proliferation leads to an overgrowth of smooth muscle and fibrotic tissue around the small arterioles, leading to the formation of muscularized vessels and so-called plexiform lesions. The vessels become constricted and obstructed. Plexiform lesions are arterioles that have become almost completely obstructed by an over-proliferation of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibrotic tissue. Although the association between BMP-BMPRII signaling and PAH was first identified through the study of patients with heritable forms of the disease, it is now understood that BMP-BMPRII signaling is deficient in patients with non-heritable forms of the disease, including idiopathic and associated forms of PAH. For these reasons, it is expected that a therapeutic agent that improves the signaling deficits in the BMP-BMPRII pathway, activating Smad1/5/8, could rectify key defective molecular signaling events causing the disease, with the potential to modify the course of disease.
It has been reported that a group of proteins targeted by sotatercept, the activins, are present at increased levels in PAH patients. We and others have found that activins can suppress signaling through the BMP-BMPRII pathway, as measured by assessing Smad1/5/8 activation. We further found that sotatercept, by inhibiting activins, can stimulate the BMP-BMPRII signaling pathway in isolated cells. We evaluated sotatercept for its effects on the establishment of PAH in two mouse models of the disease, and we found that sotatercept had a more profound benefit than representatives of any of the classes of standard-of-care therapies. As a result, we believe that sotatercept has the potential to correct the BMP-BMPRII signaling deficit that is fundamental to disease in PAH patients and thereby modify the course of disease. Further, because sotatercept works by a distinct mechanism from the available vasodilator agents, we believe that sotatercept can be used in combination with these other agents.
The worldwide PAH patient population is expanding, with more than 80,000 patients living with PAH in the United States and European Union combined. PAH represents one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical markets with approximately $4.5 billion in sales in the United States in 2018.
PULSAR
The PULSAR Phase 2 trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sotatercept in PAH patients. The primary endpoint of the trial was the change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance, or PVR, over a 24-week treatment period. PVR, as measured by right heart catheterization, is the resistance that the heart must overcome to pump blood through the pulmonary circulatory system. The key secondary endpoint was six-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, a measure of functional capacity/endurance. Other exploratory analyses included changes in amino-terminal brain natriuretic propeptide, or NT-proBNP, a hormone secreted by cardiac muscle cells in response to stretching caused by increased blood volume in the heart; mean pulmonary arterial pressure, a hemodynamic measure of average pressure in the main pulmonary arteries, which is elevated in PAH patients; and World Health Organization, or WHO, functional class.
A total of 106 patients were randomized in a 3:3:4 ratio to receive placebo, 0.3 mg/kg of sotatercept, or 0.7 mg/kg of sotatercept subcutaneously every 21 days in combination with stable background PAH-specific therapies, including mono, double, and triple therapy, over a 24-week treatment period. Of the 106 patients participating in the trial, 35% were receiving double background PAH-specific therapies and 56% were receiving triple background PAH-specific therapies. The trial was powered to detect an 18% reduction in the primary endpoint of PVR and a 24-meter improvement in the secondary endpoint of 6MWD.
In June 2020, we presented results of the PULSAR Phase 2 trial of sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. During the "Breaking News: Clinical Trials in Pulmonary Medicine" session of the American Thoracic Society, or ATS, 2020 Virtual Conference, study investigators reported that patients on stable background PAH-specific therapies treated with sotatercept experienced a statistically significant mean reduction in PVR, the trial's primary endpoint, at week 24 versus placebo.
The trial achieved its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint, and showed concordance of results across multiple additional endpoints and regardless of baseline characteristics. Patients on stable background therapy who were treated with 0.3 mg/kg or 0.7 mg/kg of sotatercept experienced mean PVR reductions of approximately 21% and 34%, respectively. The trial 
also achieved a statistically significant all-dose mean improvement from baseline of 54 meters in the key secondary endpoint of six-minute walk distance and a placebo corrected improvement of 25 meters (all doses combined).
Primary Endpoint:

Treatment* | % Reduction in PVR | P-Value
Sotatercept 0.3 mg/kg (n=32) | 20.5% | 0.0027 
Sotatercept 0.7 mg/kg (n=42) | 33.9% | <0.0001
Placebo (n=32) | 2.1% | 

*All cohorts include stable background PAH-specific therapies. 
The trial also achieved the protocol-defined improvement in the key secondary endpoint of 6MWD at 24 weeks. Both sotatercept dose groups achieved at least a 50-meter (LS mean) increase from baseline, as demonstrated in the 0.3 mg/kg group (58 meters) and the 0.7 mg/kg group (50 meters), allowing for a pre-specified pooled analysis. Overall, treatment with sotatercept (pooled analysis) achieved a 54-meter (LS mean) change from baseline and a placebo-corrected (LS mean) difference of 25 meters (nominal p=0.03).
Treatment with sotatercept also demonstrated improvement across multiple exploratory study endpoints at week 24, including a 51% reduction in NT-proBNP and 20% reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure. In addition, 23% of subjects improved their WHO functional class.
Sotatercept was generally well tolerated in the trial. Adverse events observed in the study were generally consistent with previously published data on sotatercept in clinical trials in other patient populations. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were reported in 6% (2/32) of patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg of sotatercept plus background therapy, 24% (10/42) of patients receiving 0.7 mg/kg of sotatercept plus background therapy, and in 9% (3/32) of patients receiving placebo plus background therapy. Hemoglobin increase was reported in one patient (3%) in the 0.3 mg/kg sotatercept dose group and in 6 patients (14%) in the 0.7 mg/kg sotatercept dose group. No patient in the placebo group experienced an increase in hemoglobin. Two patients (6%) in the 0.3 mg/kg sotatercept dose group and 5 patients (12%) in the 0.7 mg/kg sotatercept dose group experienced thrombocytopenia. One patient in the 0.7 mg/kg sotatercept dose group who had many pre-existing risk factors died due to a cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to study treatment. A total of 5 patients (2 in the 0.3 mg/kg sotatercept dose group and 3 in the 0.7 mg/kg sotatercept dose group) experienced TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation as opposed to 1 patient in the placebo group. TEAEs occurring in 10% or more of all patients in any arm were headache, diarrhea, peripheral edema, dizziness, fatigue, hypokalemia, and nausea.
Following the 6-month double-blind treatment period, participants in the PULSAR Phase 2 trial were eligible to continue in the 18-month extension period. As of February 22, 2021, 91 of 97 patients who opted to participate in the 18-month extension period of the trial were still enrolled, and 94 patients had been treated with sotatercept for at least 12 months. 
In November 2020, we presented additional cardiac and pulmonary function data at the virtual 2020 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions showing improvement in right ventricular-pulmonary arterial (RV-PA) coupling, which represents the match between the output of the RV and the resistance of the pulmonary vasculature, as well as improvement in RV function. 
SPECTRA
We have completed enrollment in an exploratory study called SPECTRA to provide us with greater understanding of sotatercept's potential impact on PAH. In November 2020, we presented preliminary interim results from the SPECTRA trial at the virtual 2020 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions showing that patients treated with sotatercept experienced substantial improvements in multiple hemodynamic measures as well as in exercise tolerance and exercise capacity. These early outcomes, obtained from the first 10 patients participating in the trial, were shared as part of an Invited Talk entitled, “SPECTRA and Beyond: Signs of Disease Modification?” presented virtually during the American Heart Association (AHA) 2020 Scientific Sessions. Among the largest resting hemodynamic improvements observed were reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; as measured in dynes-sec/cm5) from a mean of 576 at baseline to 369 at week 24 (35.9% reduction) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) as measured in mmHg from 43.4 to 30.6. (29.5% reduction). Sotatercept was generally well tolerated in the trial. Adverse events observed in the study were generally consistent with previously published data on sotatercept in PAH and in other diseases.
We expect to announce additional results from the SPECTRA trial in the first half of 2021.
REBLOZYL® (luspatercept-aamt)
REBLOZYL is a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent designed to promote RBC production through a novel mechanism. To date, REBLOZYL has received regulatory approval in the following regions for the following indications:

Date | Region | Indication 
November 2019 | United States | Treatment of anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions. 
April 2020 | United States | Treatment of anemia failing an erythropoiesis stimulating agent and requiring 2 or more red blood cell units over 8 weeks in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts or with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. 
June 2020 | European Union | Treatment of:Adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to very low-, low- and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts, who had an unsatisfactory response or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy.Adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia associated with beta thalassemia.
September 2020 | Canada | Treatment of adult patients with red blood cell transfusion-dependent anemia associated with beta-thalassemia. 
February 2021 | Canada | Treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia requiring at least two red blood cell units over 8 weeks resulting from very low-to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who have ring sideroblasts and who have failed or are not suitable for erythropoietin-based therapy. 

The regulatory approvals in patients with beta-thalassemia listed above are based on data from the Phase 3 BELIEVE trial, which compared luspatercept-aamt + best supportive care versus placebo + best supportive care in adult beta-thalassemia patients who require regular red blood cell transfusions. The approvals in patients with MSA listed above are based on data from the Phase 3 MEDALIST trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of luspatercept-aamt in patients with very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk non-del(5q) MDS.
In addition to the BELIEVE and MEDALIST indications, luspatercept-aamt is being developed to treat anemia in patients with non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia, with myelofibrosis, and as a first-line treatment for patients with lower-risk MDS, as further described below.
Beta-thalassemia
The thalassemias comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders arising from defects in the genes that encode the proteins that comprise hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a four-subunit protein complex formed of two alpha-subunits and two beta-subunits, each with an iron-containing heme group that binds to and carries oxygen molecules within red blood cells. There are two main classifications of thalassemia, alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia, depending on whether the genetic defect lies in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit or the beta-subunit, respectively. Beta-thalassemia is particularly prevalent throughout the Mediterranean region, Middle East, and Southeast Asia, and, due to migration and immigration, is increasingly a global disease. The Thalassaemia International Federation estimates that there are approximately 300,000 patients worldwide with beta-thalassemia, approximately 20,000 of which are in the United States and Europe, who are dependent on frequent blood transfusions. We estimate that there are at least as many beta-thalassemia patients in the same regions who are not transfusion dependent and not included in these estimates. Many of these patients have hemoglobin levels that are approximately half that of normal individuals and experience significant complications of the disease. Beta-thalassemia is treated primarily by RBC transfusions that, over time, cause a toxic accumulation of iron in the body. A central challenge for managing patients with beta-thalassemia is to restore the RBC levels while avoiding iron overload. Iron chelation therapy alone costs between $35,000 and $75,000 per year in the United States and certain countries in Europe and yet does not treat the underlying anemia. The course of the disease depends largely on whether patients are maintained on an adequate transfusion and iron chelation regimen. Poor compliance with transfusion and/or iron chelation is associated with a poor prognosis and shortened survival. However, even with the standard of care, patients are at risk of infection from transfusions as well as toxicities related to iron chelation therapy.
In addition to REBLOZYL, patients with beta-thalassemia are treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is used as a potentially curative approach for beta-thalassemia, however this option is limited by the availability of appropriate donors and by risks, including death, associated with the bone marrow transplant procedure. Consequently this treatment is used 
only in the most severely affected patients. Bluebird bio’s betibeglogene autotemcel gene therapy (beti-cel; formerly LentiGlobin™ for β-thalassemia), a gene-therapy program delivered after single-agent, myeloablative busulfan conditioning, which was granted conditional marketing authorization by the European Commission for patients with transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia in June 2019. Bluebird Bio announced that its submission of a BLA to the FDA for transfusion dependent beta thalassemia is expected to occur in mid-2021.
BEYOND
In addition to the approved indications in beta-thalassemia based on the BELIEVE Phase 3 trial, BMS is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial with luspatercept-aamt in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients, referred to as the BEYOND trial, with results currently expected in the first half of 2021.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
MDS is a group of heterogeneous hematologic diseases characterized by abnormal proliferation and differentiation of blood precursor cells, including RBC precursors, in the bone marrow. This leads to peripheral reductions in red blood cells, often accompanied by decreases in white blood cells and platelets, as well as a risk of disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Although MDS patients may have varying forms of the disease, anemia is present in the vast majority of MDS patients at the time of diagnosis. MDS is primarily a disease of the elderly, with 88% of cases diagnosed in individuals 60 years of age or older. Cancer surveillance databases estimate the annual incidence of MDS in the United States at over 15,000 cases and the overall U.S./EU prevalence to be at least 125,000 patients.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represents the only treatment modality with curative potential, although the relatively high morbidity and mortality of this approach limits its use. Approximately 75% of the MDS patients in the United States and EU are classified as lower risk and 25% are classified as higher risk. High risk patients are typically treated with inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase such as Vidaza® or Dacogen®, or generic versions that are now available in some countries. Many categorized as lower-risk typically receive ESAs as first-line therapy, though ESAs are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia in MDS patients. Therapeutic options following failure on ESAs are limited, and most patients end up receiving RBC transfusions to manage their anemia. Approximately 15% of patients with MDS have a specific chromosomal mutation and are treated with Revlimid®. 
The chronic anemia in MDS is primarily due to ineffective erythropoiesis, and a significant number of MDS patients have serum erythropoietin levels substantially above the normal range, indicating that the chronic anemia in these MDS patients is not a consequence of erythropoietin deficiency. The ineffective erythropoiesis of MDS may be caused by excess signaling by members of the TGF-beta superfamily, which inhibits RBC maturation. For this reason, we believe that blocking this excess signaling by luspatercept-aamt may reverse this inhibition. More than half of MDS patients are unresponsive to the administration of recombinant erythropoietin and instead require RBC transfusions, which can increase the risk of infection and iron-overload related toxicities. Treatment-resistant chronic anemia resulting from ineffective erythropoiesis is a major cause of morbidity in MDS patients.
COMMANDS
In addition to the approved indications in MDS based on the MEDALIST Phase 3 trial, BMS is currently conducting the COMMANDS Phase 3 trial with luspatercept-aamt in first-line, lower-risk MDS patients and enrollment is ongoing, with topline results expected in or after 2022.
Myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis is an acquired disease of the bone marrow that results in replacement of the bone marrow with fibrotic tissue leading to bone marrow failure and inability to make new blood cells, including red blood cells, which leads to anemia. Epidemiological databases suggest that there are approximately 30,000 myelofibrosis patients in the United States and Europe. Approximately 30% of myelofibrosis patients present primarily with anemia when diagnosed and nearly all patients will develop anemia with progression of the disease. There is no approved drug therapy to treat chronic anemia in myelofibrosis. 
In December 2020, updated results from the Phase 2 clinical trial with luspatercept-aamt in patients with myelofibrosis associated anemia were presented at the 62nd ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial as of the cut-off date for the updated analysis (March 29, 2020) in multiple cohorts of patients including two groups with anemia only (hemoglobin level equal to or below 9.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) and with no red blood cell, or RBC, transfusions in the 12-week period prior to the first dose) and without concomitant ruxolitinib (Cohort 1; n=22) or with concomitant ruxolitinib (Cohort 3A; n=14). Two other groups included transfusion dependent (TD; received 6-12 RBC units per 84 days in the 12 weeks prior to the date of the first dose or 4-12 RBC units per 84 days for the three patients enrolled in the 
expansion cohort in Cohort 3B) patients without concomitant ruxolitinib (Cohort 2; n=21) and with concomitant ruxolitinib (Cohort 3B; n=22).
Patients in Cohort 3A or 3B were required to be on a stable dose of ruxolitinib for at least 16 weeks prior to initiating luspatercept-aamt; the three additional patients enrolled in the expansion cohort in Cohort 3B were on a stable dose of ruxolitinib for 40 weeks. All patients received luspatercept-aamt at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg subcutaneously in three-week treatment cycles and dose increases were allowed up to a maximum dose level of 1.75 mg/kg (the three patients in the expansion cohort of Cohort 3B began at a starting dose of 1.33 mg/kg). 
For anemia-only patients (Cohorts 1 and 3A), the primary endpoint was a hemoglobin (Hb) increase of at least 1.5 g/dL from baseline for at least 12 consecutive weeks at every assessment within the first 24 weeks on the study, in the absence of any RBC transfusions. An additional endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a mean Hb increase of at least 1.5 g/dL over any consecutive 12-week period in absence of RBC transfusions. As of the initial clinical data cutoff date (August 5, 2019), 14% (3/22) and 21% (3/14) of anemia-only patients met the primary endpoint in Cohorts 1 and 3A, respectively. Additionally, 18% (4/22) of Cohort 1 and 64% (9/14) of Cohort 3A patients achieved a mean Hb increase of at least 1.5 g/dL from baseline over any consecutive 12-week period.
For patients receiving RBC transfusions (Cohorts 2 and 3B), the primary endpoint was RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI) for at least 12 consecutive weeks within the first 24 weeks of the study. An additional endpoint was the proportion of patients demonstrating at least a 50% reduction in their transfusion burden from baseline (minimum 4 RBC units) over at least any consecutive 12-week period. In Cohorts 2 and 3B, 10% (2/21) and 27% (6/22) of patients achieved the primary endpoint, respectively. Additionally, 38% (8/21) of Cohort 2 and 46% (10/22) of Cohort 3B patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in RBC transfusion burden from baseline (minimum 4 RBC units). Additionally, 19% (4/21) and 36% (8/22) of patients in Cohorts 2 and 3B, respectively, achieved RBC-TI for at least 12 weeks anytime during the entire treatment duration. Among the patients who reached 24 weeks of treatment, 4 of 15 (27%) and 8 of 14 (57%) in Cohorts 2 and 3B achieved clinical benefit (defined as RBC transfusion burden reduction by ≥ 50% and by ≥ 4 RBC U for ≥ 12 weeks) and therefore continued to receive luspatercept after 24 weeks
Six percent (5/79) of patients had grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs. The most common related TEAEs of any grade occurring in at least 5% of patients were hypertension (13%), bone pain (9%), and diarrhea (5%). Treatment discontinuations as the result of related TEAEs occurred in eight (10%) patients. There were no treatment-related deaths.
As a result of the phase 2 study, BMS is in the process of initiating the pivotal Phase 3 INDEPENDENCE study in patients with myelofibrosis-associated anemia who are being treated with JAK inhibitor therapy and require RBC transfusions. 
ACE-1334
ACE-1334 is a wholly owned TGF-beta superfamily-based ligand trap designed to bind and inhibit TGF-beta 1 and 3 ligands but not TGF-beta 2. We recently completed an ascending-dose Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, and the FDA has granted Fast Track designation to ACE-1334 in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, or SSc-ILD, as well as Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of systemic sclerosis. We intend to initiate a Phase 1b/Phase 2 clinical trial with ACE-1334 in patients with SSc-ILD in 2021. 
Systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD)
SSc-ILD, also known as systemic scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease, is a rare, progressive, autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by immune dysregulation. It is reported to be the most common cause of death among patients with systemic scleroderma. Patients with SSc-ILD ultimately experience severely compromised pulmonary function, with the disease initially causing cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. SSc-ILD, which affects an estimated 50,000 patients in the United States and Europe, is thought to arise from a combination of genetic susceptibility, autoimmunity, inflammation, fibrotic activity, and vascular insult. The disease has an estimated 10-year survival rate of approximately 56%. Current treatment for SSc-ILD includes a range of potentially high-risk approaches, including immunosuppression, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and lung transplantation.
Preclinical Programs
In addition to our clinical development activities, we are expanding our research capabilities in order to increase the rate at which our highly productive research group can identify and advance new, internally discovered, therapeutic candidates for 
clinical development. Our discovery efforts are primarily focused on identifying new protein therapeutic candidates from our fusion protein platform, which includes the IntelliTrap™ platform, and identifying novel antibodies.
Our Strategic Partnerships
Collaborations with corporate partners have provided us with significant funding and access to our partners' scientific, development, regulatory and commercial capabilities. We have received more than $595.8 million from our collaborations with BMS and our prior collaborations with Alkermes plc (Alkermes) and Shire AG (Shire).
BMS
On February 20, 2008 we entered into an agreement with Celgene, which was acquired by BMS in 2019 and which we now refer to as BMS, relating to sotatercept, which we refer to as the Original Sotatercept Agreement. We amended the Original Sotatercept Agreement on August 2, 2011, which we refer to as the Amended Sotatercept Agreement. We further amended and restated the Amended Sotatercept Agreement in its entirety on September 18, 2017, and clarified certain responsibilities of the Company and BMS in a letter agreement to the Restated Sotatercept Agreement on March 10, 2020. We refer to the amended and restated agreement, as clarified in the letter agreement, as the Restated Sotatercept Agreement. On August 2, 2011 we entered into a second agreement with BMS for REBLOZYL, which we refer to as the REBLOZYL Agreement.
Restated Sotatercept Agreement.   The Restated Sotatercept Agreement provides BMS with an exclusive license to sotatercept outside of the PH field, and provides us with the worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize sotatercept in the PH field. We also granted BMS an option to license discovery stage compounds against three specified targets. BMS paid $45.0 million and bought $5.0 million of equity upon execution of the Original Sotatercept Agreement and, as of December 31, 2020, we have received $45.0 million in research and development funding and milestone payments for the sotatercept program.
In connection with the Restated Sotatercept Agreement, BMS agreed not to develop or commercialize in the PH field any compound developed under the Restated Sotatercept Agreement or the REBLOZYL Agreement, and we agreed not to develop or commercialize any compound developed under the Restated Sotatercept Agreement or the REBLOZYL Agreement in any field outside of the PH field. We have the right to license, transfer or sell our rights to develop and commercialize sotatercept in the PH field, subject to BMS’s right of first negotiation.
We are responsible for 100% of the costs related to our development and commercialization of sotatercept in the PH field. Pursuant to the Restated Sotatercept Agreement, we have aligned with BMS through the Joint Commercialization Committee that we will be the distributing party for the commercialization of sotatercept in the PH field, and that if sotatercept is approved and commercialized to treat PAH, we will recognize revenue from global net sales and owe BMS a royalty in the low 20% range. With respect to the development and commercialization of sotatercept outside of the PH field or the development and commercialization of any other compound under the Restated Sotatercept Agreement, the terms of the Amended Sotatercept Agreement remained unchanged. 
Since January 1, 2013, BMS has been responsible for paying 100% of worldwide development costs for the sotatercept program outside of the PH field and BMS will be responsible for all commercialization costs worldwide, as approved in budgets agreed to between us and BMS. We will be eligible to receive tiered royalty payments in the low-to-mid 20% range on net sales of sotatercept outside of the PH field. We are obligated to co-promote sotatercept outside of the PH field and future products in all fields, in each case if approved, in North America, and BMS will pay all costs related thereto pursuant to the commercialization plan and budget. Outside the PH field, BMS will be responsible for any sotatercept Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as any additional Phase 2 clinical trials, and is responsible for manufacturing or overseeing the manufacture of Phase 3 and commercial supplies.
Pursuant to the Restated Sotatercept Agreement, BMS has provided us with certain quantities of BMS’s existing clinical supply of sotatercept for development in the PH field at no cost to us. BMS declined its option to manufacture additional clinical supply and any commercial supply of sotatercept in the PH Field, and we are responsible for our future supply of sotatercept in the PH field. The conduct of the collaboration is managed by a Joint Development Committee and Joint Commercialization Committee. In the event of a deadlock of a committee, we shall determine the resolution of issues specifically related to the PH field (other than pricing which shall be determined by consensus), and BMS shall determine the resolution of all other issues. The Joint Commercialization Committee will oversee commercialization of sotatercept and sotatercept pricing will be determined by mutual agreement of us and BMS in the Joint Commercialization Committee.
The Restated Sotatercept Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis on the latest to occur of the following: (1) the expiration of the royalty term with respect to all license products outside the PH field in such country, (2) the expiration of the royalty term with respect to all sotatercept licensed products in the PH field in such country, and (3) the exercise or 
forfeiture by BMS of its option with regard to each option compound. In the PH field, the royalty term for each licensed product in each country is the period commencing with first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ending on the latest of expiration of specified patent coverage or a specified period of years. Outside the PH field, the royalty term for each licensed product in each country outside North America is the period commencing with first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ending on the latest of expiration of specified patent coverage or a specified period of years, and the royalty term for each licensed product in North America is the period commencing with the first commercial sale in North America and ending, on a licensed product and country-by-country basis, on the date which commercialization of such licensed product has ceased. The term for each option compound runs for a specified period of years unless BMS exercises its option, in which case the compound becomes a licensed product, or forfeits its option by failing to make certain payments following the achievement of certain milestones in early clinical development of the option compound.
The Restated Sotatercept Agreement is terminable by either party upon a breach that is uncured and continuing or by BMS for convenience on a country-by-country or product-by-product basis, or in its entirety. BMS may also terminate the Restated Sotatercept Agreement, in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis, for failure of a product to meet a development or clinical trial endpoint. Termination for cause by us or termination by BMS for convenience or failure to meet an endpoint will have the effect of terminating the applicable license to BMS and the rights granted to us with respect to the development of sotatercept in the PH field shall become irrevocable. Termination for cause by either party shall result in reducing the remaining royalties due to the breaching party by a certain percentage. Upon termination by BMS for convenience or for failure to meet an endpoint, we and BMS will enter into a termination agreement pursuant to which, among other things, BMS will continue to be eligible to receive a royalty in the low 20% range on global net sales of sotatercept in the PH field. 
We are eligible to receive future development, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $360.0 million for the sotatercept program outside of the PH field and up to an additional $348.0 million for each of the three discovery stage programs. None of the three discovery stage programs has advanced to the stage to achieve payment of a milestone, nor do we expect any such milestone payments in the near future. We were not required to make any upfront payments to BMS upon execution of the Restated Sotatercept Agreement, and we will not be required to make any milestone payments to BMS in connection with our development and commercialization of sotatercept in the PH field.
REBLOZYL Agreement.    The REBLOZYL Agreement provides BMS with an exclusive license to REBLOZYL in all indications and we and BMS are collaborating in the development and commercialization of REBLOZYL. We also granted BMS an option to license products for which we file an investigational new drug application for the treatment of anemia. BMS paid $25.0 million to us upon execution of the REBLOZYL Agreement in August 2011 and, as of December 31, 2020, we have received $256.6 million in research and development funding, milestone payments, and royalties for the REBLOZYL program.
 Under the REBLOZYL Agreement, the conduct of the collaboration is managed by a Joint Development Committee and Joint Commercialization Committee. Other than with respect to certain matters related to our conduct of Phase 2 trials, in the event of a deadlock of a committee, the resolution of the relevant issue is determined by BMS. Since January 1, 2013, BMS has been responsible for paying 100% of worldwide development costs for the REBLOZYL program and BMS will be responsible for all commercialization costs worldwide, as approved in the budgets agreed to between us and BMS. We are obligated to co-promote REBLOZYL and future products, in each case if approved, in North America, and BMS will pay all costs related thereto. Activities that we elect to conduct outside of the approved budgets to support REBLOZYL are at our own expense. We are eligible to receive tiered royalty payments in the low-to-mid 20% range on net sales of REBLOZYL. 
The REBLOZYL Agreement is terminable by either party upon a breach that is uncured and continuing or by BMS for convenience on a country-by-country or product-by-product basis, or in its entirety. BMS may also terminate the REBLOZYL Agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis for failure of a product to meet a development or clinical trial endpoint. Termination for cause by us or termination by BMS for convenience or failure to meet an endpoint will have the effect of terminating the applicable license, while termination for cause by BMS will have the effect of reducing remaining royalties by a certain percentage.
Under the REBLOZYL Agreement, we retained responsibility for research, development through the end of Phase 1 and the two ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials in MDS and beta-thalassemia, as well as manufacturing the clinical supplies for these studies. BMS may supply additional clinical supplies for our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials in MDS and beta-thalassemia if needed. BMS will conduct any subsequent Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. We were responsible for manufacturing REBLOZYL for all Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and BMS has responsibility for the manufacture of REBLOZYL for any additional Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial supplies. We are eligible to receive future regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $100.0 million for the REBLOZYL program.
Competition
The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We and our collaborators will face competition with respect to all therapeutic candidates we may develop or commercialize in the future from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of the entities developing and marketing potentially competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.
REBLOZYL and our clinical stage therapeutic candidates, if approved, will compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the following indications, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications:
Beta-thalassemia
•RBC transfusions, which are used to treat anemia in patients with beta-thalassemia, and iron chelation therapy, such as Novartis's oral iron chelating agents Exjade® and JadenuTM, which are used to treat iron overload in patients with beta-thalassemia.
•Fetal hemoglobin stimulating agents, such as hydroxyurea, which are primarily used to treat patients with anemia from sickle cell disease, and are sometimes used to treat patients with beta-thalassemia.
•Hematopoietic stem cell transplant treatment, which is given to a small percentage of patients with beta-thalassemia, since it requires a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells. Certain academic centers around the world are seeking to develop improvements to this approach.
•Bluebird bio’s gene therapy program, betibeglogene autotemcel gene therapy (beti-cel; formerly LentiGlobin™ for β-thalassemia), a gene-therapy program delivered after single-agent, myeloablative busulfan conditioning, which was granted conditional marketing authorization by the European Commission for patients with transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia in June 2019. Bluebird Bio announced that its submission of a BLA to the FDA for transfusion dependent beta thalassemia is expected to occur in mid-2021.
•Other therapies in development, including gene therapy and genome editing, that are being developed by several different groups, including Orchard Therapeutics, Sangamo BioSciences Inc. in collaboration with Sanofi, and CRISPR Therapeutics in collaboration with Vertex. Agios Pharmaceuticals is also developing mitapivat (AG-348), a small molecule allosteric activator of wild-type and a variety of mutated pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) enzymes, and announced that it would initiate a pivotal study in 2021 evaluating mitapivat in thalassemia, including both alpha- and beta-thalassemia, as well as transfusion dependent and non-transfusion dependent patient populations.
MDS
•Recombinant erythropoietin and other erythropoiesis stimulating agents. Although these agents are not approved to treat anemia in MDS in the United States, current practice guidelines include the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and granulocyte colony stimulating factor agents (G-CSF) to treat patients with MDS. Eprex® from Janssen Pharmaceuticals was recently approved in Europe to treat symptomatic anemia in certain patients with lower risk MDS.
•Red blood cell transfusions, which are used to treat anemia in patients with MDS, and iron chelation therapy, such as Novartis's oral iron chelating agents Exjade® and JadenuTM, which are used to treat iron overload in patients with MDS.
•Immunomodulators, including BMS's approved product, Revlimid® (lenalidomide), for the treatment of anemia of certain MDS patients.
•hypomethylating agents azacitidine, which is approved by the FDA to treat certain French-American-British MDS subtypes, which includes some lower risk MDS patients, and Inqovi (decitabine and cedazuridine) tablets approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).
•Roxadustat (FG-4592), a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that Fibrogen is studying in a Phase 3 study in lower risk MDS patients with anemia and low transfusion burden.
•Other therapies in development, including: 
◦an oral form of the hypomethylating agent azacitidine, known as CC-486, being developed by BMS to treat patients with transfusion dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia due to lower risk MDS, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States and Europe, and is now approved under the name Onureg (azacitidine tablets) as a maintenance treatment for adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia; 
◦an anti-cancer therapy being developed by Onconova to treat patients with high risk MDS; 
◦a telemorase inhibitor, imetelstat, being studied by Geron in a Phase 2/3 study in lower risk MDS patients; and a CD95 ligand inhibitor, Asunercept, formerly APG101, being studied by Apogenix, completed a Phase 1 study in transfusion dependent, lower risk MDS patients; and
◦KER-050, a modified activin receptor type IIA Fc fusion protein, is being developed by Keros Therapeutics, Inc. in a Phase 2 study to treat cytopenias, including anemia in patients with MDS.
Myelofibrosis
•Red blood cell transfusions, which are used to treat anemia in patients with myelofibrosis, and iron chelation therapy, such as Novartis's oral iron chelating agents Exjade® and JadenuTM, which are used to treat iron overload in patients with myelofibrosis.
•Recombinant erythropoietin, other erythropoiesis stimulating agents, androgen therapy, and immunomodulatory drugs. Although these agents are not approved to treat anemia in myelofibrosis in the United States, current practice guidelines include the use of these agents to treat anemia in patients with myelofibrosis. 
•A telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, is being studied by Geron to treat intermediate-2 or high-risk in patients with myelofibrosis, and Geron has announced plans to initiate a Phase 3 study in the first quarter of 2021.
•Momelotinib, a JAK1, JAK2, ACVR1 inhibitor acquired by Sierra Oncology from Gilead Inc., which is in development for treatment of myelofibrosis. Momelotinib has been investigated in two completed Phase 3 trials for the treatment of myelofibrosis and is currently moving forward in a new Phase 3 trial in patients with myelofibrosis who have been treated previously with a JAK inhibitor.
•Constellation Pharmaceuticals's BET inhibitor, CPI-0610, which is in Phase 2 clinical development to treat patients with myelofibrosis in a first-line setting, second-line JAK refractory, and second-line JAK combination. Constellation has announced plans to conduct a Phase 3 trial in treatment-naïve or post-polycythemia and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis patients.
•Keros Therapeutics, Inc. has announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 study in 2021 with KER-050, a modified activin receptor type IIA Fc fusion protein, to treat patients with myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias.
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
If sotatercept is approved for the treatment of patients with PAH, it may compete with four distinct classes of vasodilator therapies:
•Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors Adcira® (tadalafil, Eli Lilly) and Revatio® (sildenafil, Pfizer), which are orally available small molecules. PDE5 inhibitors prevent degradation of intracellular cGMP released in response to nitric oxide (NO), resulting in relaxation of pulmonary vessels.
•Soluble guanylate cylase (sGC) stimulator Adempas® (riociguat, Bayer), which targets different molecules in the same biological pathway as PDE5 inhibitors and is also an oral small molecule.
•Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) Letairis® (ambrisentan, Gilead), Opsumit® (macitentan, Actelion/J&J), and Tracleer® (bosentan, Actelion/J&J)), which are all orally available small molecules. ERAs block activity of endothelin-1, which causes constriction of pulmonary vessels.
•Prostacyclin analogues relax pulmonary vessels, which prevent platelet aggregation, and inhibit smooth muscle proliferation. They are the most potent therapies for treating PAH and are available orally (Orenitram® (trepostinil, United Therapeutics)); for inhalation (Tyvaso® (trepostinil, United Therapeutics), Ventavis® (iloprost, Actelion/J&J)); and for infusion (Remodulin® (trepostinil, United Therapeutics), Veletri® (epoprostenol, Actelion/J&J)). Uptravi (selexipag, Actelion/J&J) is a potent, orally delivered selective IP receptor agonist which activates a prostacyclin receptor, helping pulmonary vessels to relax. 
In addition, agents with novel mechanisms of action are being investigated for treatment of patients with PAH:
•Gossamer Bio is studying seralutinib (GB002), an inhaled platelet-derived growth factor receptor, or PDGFR, kinase inhibitor, in a Phase 2 study in patients with PAH.
•PhaseBio is evaluating a VPAC peptide PB1046 in a Phase 2 trial in patients with PAH. 
•Two companies are evaluating agents that are intended to enhance BMPR2 signaling in patients with PAH. Vivus Inc. is evaluating tacrolimus in a phase 2 trial in patients with PAH. Morphogen IX Ltd. is in the process of preclinical development of a protein-engineered variant of BMP9, MGX292, for eventual clinical evaluation in patients with PAH.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will be its efficacy, safety profile, price, method of administration and level of promotional activity.
Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD)
We are planning to initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical study with ACE-1334 for the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD in 2021. Immunosuppressive therapies, or ISTs, are currently used to manage decline in SSc patients both with and without lung involvement. Primary ISTs used to treat SSc-ILD include mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine. OFEV (nintedanib), an anti-fibrotic, is the first and only approved therapy for SSc-ILD specifically. Lung transplantation may be evaluated for patients with significant decline in lung function and that can tolerate the procedure. 
If ACE-1334 is approved in SSc-ILD, it may compete with several classes of products in development. These classes include anti-fibrotics, anti-inflammatory, and cell and gene therapy, as follows: 
•Anti-fibrotic products Esbriet (pirfenidone, Roche) and HZN-825 (Horizon). Esbriet, which is already approved in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is in Phase III in the US. HZN-825 is in Phase II in the US.
•Anti-inflammatory products Romilkimab (Sanofi), ifetroban (Cumberland Pharmaceuticals), and EHP-101 (Emerald Health Therapeutics) are in Phase II development in the US.
•Products with both an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects such as Actemra (tocilizumab, Genentech) and lenabasum (Corbus) recently completed Phase III trials in SSc patients with and without ILD. These trials failed primary endpoints on mRSS and ACR CRISS respectively; however, they may continue development in SSc-ILD. Additional pipeline products in this class include belumosudil (Kadmon Holdings) in Phase 2 development and CM-101 (Chemomab Therapeutics) in Phase 1 development for SSc-ILD, as well as GSK-2330811 (GlaxoSmithKline) in Phase 1 development for SSc. 
•Cell and gene therapies for SSc with and without ILD are in Phase I/II trials, such as FCR-001 from Talaris and FCX-013 from Fibrocell. 
Commercialization
We retain co-promotion rights in North America with our collaboration partner, BMS, for both REBLOZYL and, outside of the PH field, sotatercept, and under the terms of our agreements with BMS our commercialization costs will be entirely funded by BMS as approved in the budget agreed to between us and BMS. We also currently retain worldwide commercialization rights for sotatercept in the PH field and ACE-1334. We intend to build a pulmonary disorder focused specialty sales force globally, and we have already established a hematology specialty sales force in the United States to support the launch of REBLOZYL. We believe that a specialty sales force will be sufficient to target key prescribing physicians in these areas. Now with the launch of REBLOZYL in its first two indications, we have limited sales and marketing capabilities and experience through our co-promote with BMS, but we will need to establish additional required capabilities within an appropriate time frame ahead of other product approvals and commercialization to support other products. If we are not able to establish sales and marketing capabilities or are not successful in commercializing our future products, either on our own or through collaborations, any future product revenue will be materially adversely affected.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our therapeutic candidates, novel biological discoveries, screening and drug development technology, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and 
other countries that relate to the regulation of biosimilar molecules and orphan drug status. These statutory frameworks provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See "Government Regulation".
Our patenting strategy is focused on our therapeutic candidates. We seek composition-of-matter and method-of-treatment patents for each such protein in key therapeutic areas. We also seek patent protection with respect to companion diagnostic methods and compositions and treatments for targeted patient populations. We have sought patent protection alone or jointly with our collaborators, as dictated by our collaboration agreements.
Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes approximately 1,061 issued patents and approximately 823 pending patent applications, with pending and issued claims relating to all of our current advanced clinical stage therapeutic candidates, sotatercept and ACE-1334, and our approved product, REBLOZYL. These figures include in-licensed patents and patent applications to which we hold exclusive commercial rights.
Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest international filing date. Our issued patents and pending applications with respect to our clinical stage therapeutic candidates will expire on dates ranging from 2026 to 2040, exclusive of possible patent term extensions, However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
National and international patent laws concerning therapeutic candidates remain highly unsettled. No consistent policy regarding the patent-eligibility or the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States, Europe or other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our therapeutic candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below:
REBLOZYL Patent Coverage
We hold two issued patents covering the REBLOZYL composition of matter in the United States, two issued patents in Europe (registered in most countries of the European Patent Convention) and additional patents issued or pending patent applications in many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and India.

Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
In-Licenses
Salk
In August 2010, we entered into two amended and restated license agreements with the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, or Salk, providing rights under U.S. patent filings solely owned by Salk. The agreements for the licensed patent rights relate to the first cloning of the type II activin receptors, human ActRIIA and frog ActRIIB, respectively, and include claims to vertebrate homolog nucleic acids and proteins with respect to each of the foregoing. These patent rights expired between the years 2016 and 2017. One of these agreements relates to ActRIIA and sotatercept; the other agreement relates to ActRIIB, REBLOZYL and the discontinued program ACE-031, which we refer to as the ActRIIB Agreement. The licenses granted are exclusive as to the therapeutic products that are covered by the patents and non-exclusive as to diagnostic products and other products that are developed using the Salk patent rights. If we sublicense the Salk patent rights, we will owe Salk a percentage of sublicensing revenue, excluding payments based on sales. Under the agreements, Salk retained rights, on behalf of itself and other non-profit academic institutions, to practice under the licensed rights for non-profit purposes. We agreed to pay Salk specified development milestone payments totaling up to $2.0 million for sotatercept and $0.7 million for REBLOZYL. In addition, we are required to pay Salk royalties in the low single-digits on worldwide net product sales by us or our sublicensees of products claimed in the licensed patents, or derived from use of the licensed patent rights, with royalty obligations continuing at a reduced rate for a period of time after patent expiration. The agreements terminate upon the expiration of royalty obligations. We may terminate either agreement at any time by giving Salk advance written notice. Either agreement may also be terminated by Salk in the event of a material breach by us or in the event we become subject to bankruptcy or similar circumstances.
In October 2012, Salk filed a lawsuit against us alleging that we breached the ActRIIB Agreement. In July 2014, we settled the Salk lawsuit and entered into an amendment to the ActRIIB Agreement with Salk. Pursuant to the settlement, we made a one-time total payment of $5 million, inclusive of interest, to Salk and we agreed to pay Salk 6% of future development milestone payments received under the agreement with BMS relating to REBLOZYL. Finally, we and Salk have further agreed that the royalty percentage on net sales of REBLOZYL will remain at 1% as provided in the ActRIIB Agreement with Salk, and that such royalty will be payable until June 2022.
Fulcrum
In December 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Fulcrum Therapeutics, or Fulcrum, to identify small molecules designed to modulate specific pathways associated with a targeted indication within the pulmonary disease space. We paid an upfront research fee of $10.0 million upon execution of the agreement. We also agreed to pay specified research, development and commercial milestone payments of up to $295.0 million for a first product commercialized and up to a maximum of $143.5 million in additional milestone payments for all subsequent products commercialized. Fulcrum will additionally receive tiered royalty payments in the mid-single-digit to low double-digit range on net sales, as well as reimbursement for relevant R&D costs.
The agreement will continue on a target-by-target and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last to expire royalty obligation, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the agreement. The agreement is terminable by either party upon a breach that is uncured or insolvency of the other party and continuing, or by us for convenience on a country-by-country or collaboration molecule-by-collaboration molecule basis. 
Government Regulation
The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our therapeutic candidates and future products, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. REBLOZYL is, and we expect sotatercept and ACE-1334 to be, regulated by the FDA as biologics and reviewed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) as proteins intended for therapeutic use. Therapeutic candidates require the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the U.S. Manufacturers of therapeutic candidates may also be subject to state regulation. Failure to comply with FDA requirements may subject us or our partners, contract manufacturers, and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution.
As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, under the subtitle of Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, a statutory pathway has been created for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, earlier biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act. Under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products are granted 12 years of exclusivity before biosimilars can be approved for marketing in the United States. The objectives of the BPCIA are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the "Hatch-Waxman Act"), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products. The implementation of an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products is under the direction of the FDA. The approval of a biologic product biosimilar to one of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may be significantly less costly to bring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our products.
The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
•completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the biological product for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a BLA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs; and
•FDA review of the BLA and issuance of a biologics license which is the approval necessary to market a therapeutic candidate.
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the biologic candidate. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical trial lends themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period places the IND on clinical hold because of its concerns about the drug candidate or the conduct of the trial described in the clinical protocol. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs and under protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator's brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject's legal representative, and monitor the study until completed.
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. Phase 1 trials may be conducted in a limited number of patients, but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects. The drug candidate is initially tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.
Phase 2 trials usually involve a larger, but still limited, patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific, targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks.
Phase 3 trials further evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing might not be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, with respect to any of our therapeutic candidates. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if such trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the drug candidate for a proposed indication. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as re-authorized for five years most recently in August 2017 (PDUFA VI), the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a BLA, as well as annual program fees for approved products, can be substantial and typically increase each year. The application fee is subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers, and reductions that may be available, including waiver of the application fee for a product designated for an orphan indication. Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following FDA's receipt of the application. If the BLA is found complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. 
The outcome of FDA's review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a "complete response letter" that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the BLA unless the facility complies with cGMPs. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or 
may require additional testing or information, which can extend the review process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. Any FDA approval may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional post-approval studies be conducted as a condition of the approval, and may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA must approve a BLA supplement or a new BLA before a product may be marketed for other uses or before certain manufacturing or other changes may be made. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product is required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our therapeutic candidates under development.
After BLA approval by the FDA, the manufacturer and the holder(s) of the BLA for the product continue to be subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance.
Orphan Drug Act
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven years of market exclusivity in the United States for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of orphan drug exclusivity are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. REBLOZYL has orphan drug designation in the United States for the treatment of beta-thalassemia and for the treatment of MDS.
Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted outside the U.S., including in the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing chronic debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons or are financially not viable to develop. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The market exclusivity may be extended to 12 years if sponsors complete a pediatric investigation plan agreed upon with the relevant committee of the EMA.
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has developed a number of distinct approaches to make new drugs available as rapidly as possible in cases where there is no available treatment or there are advantages over existing treatments.
The FDA may grant “accelerated approval” to products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. For accelerated approval, the product must have an effect on a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit. These studies are known as “confirmatory trials.” Approval of a drug may be withdrawn, or the labeled indication of the drug changed if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug.
The FDA may grant “fast track” status to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product’s development plan and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of an NDA or BLA for FDA review before the entire submission is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval.
“Breakthrough Therapy” designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as 
Breakthrough Therapies, robust FDA-sponsor interaction and communication can help to identify the most efficient and expeditious path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.
The FDA may grant “priority review” status to products that, if approved, would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a BLA, with the goal to take action on the application within six months from when the application is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review.
Reimbursement
In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payers may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Managed entry agreements, arrangements between pharmaceutical companies and third-party payors that allow for coverage of new products while managing uncertainty around their financial impact or performance, may be increasingly needed in near future to secure appropriate valuation and reimbursement for new innovative therapies.
Within the United States, if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our current therapeutic candidates, we may seek approval and coverage for those products under Medicaid, Medicare and the Public Health Service (PHS) pharmaceutical pricing program and also seek to sell the products to federal agencies.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if manufacturer-reported average manufacturer price increases more than inflation and if a manufacturer enters into a supplemental rebate agreement with a specific state Medicaid program.
Medicare is a federal program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government. Medicare Part D coverage may vary from plan to plan and the plans may implement formularies and certain utilization management activities (such as tired co-pay structures and prior authorization requirements) as well as negotiate rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers to manage access and costs. Manufacturers must also provide discounts on Medicare Part D brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so called “donut hole”), which discount increased from 50% to 70% in 2019.
Medicare Part B covers most injectable and infused drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and in the physician office setting. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for Part B covered drugs based on a percentage of manufacturer-reported average sales price.
Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and paid for by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs and is intended to not exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the "federal ceiling price") and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than inflation.
To maintain Medicaid Drug Rebate Program coverage, manufacturers must extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS.
The United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“Healthcare Reform Act”) which includes changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government health care programs. Under the Trump administration, there were ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. The new Biden Administration has taken the opposite position, seeking to preserve and strengthen the 2010 Healthcare Reform Act.
Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny in the U.S. of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been several recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs. Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale.
We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct an active comparator clinical trial to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of our therapeutic candidates or products to other available therapies to support our pricing, which could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payers are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payers limit reimbursement for newly-approved healthcare products. Recent budgetary pressures in many European Union countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, including reference price grouping, price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our therapeutic candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a therapeutic candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other applicable regulatory requirements.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the EMA where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the EC of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more "concerned" member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the "reference" member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state's assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize 
the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the EC, whose decision is binding on all member states.
As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.
Fraud and Abuse and Related Regulatory Laws
We are be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such anti-kickback laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). 
Laws and regulations enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Manufacturers must also submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent laws and regulations. 
Additional Regulation
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.
There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the U.S. healthcare system. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
Manufacturing
We currently have the capability to manufacture drug substance for our preclinical studies, Phase 1 clinical trials and Phase 2 clinical trials. We manufacture material compliant to U.S. and European cGMP at our 12,000 square foot multi-product facility located at our corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We have the capabilities to manufacture receptor fusion proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and other therapeutic candidates.
Our manufacturing facility utilized single use, disposable technology to maximize efficiency and flexibility, minimizing the need for cleaning and sterilization. The facility consists of four independent clean rooms totaling 4,000 square feet. The facility includes one 250 liter and one 1,000 liter single use bioreactor and has space for two additional 1,000 liter bioreactors. We manufacture our therapeutic candidates using readily available raw materials and well established manufacturing procedures based on a standardized process modified for each of our therapeutic candidates. We produce our proteins in bioreactors using Chinese hamster ovary cells that have been genetically engineered to produce our specific therapeutic candidates. We then purify the proteins using industry standard methods, which include affinity chromatography and ultrafiltration operations.
Approximately 50 full time employees focus on our process development and manufacturing activities. Our strategic investment in manufacturing capabilities allows us to advance our therapeutic candidates efficiently and provides us with more portfolio flexibility than if we used a contract manufacturer. The facility produces drug substance in a cost-effective manner while allowing us to retain control over the process through quality control testing and quality assurance disposition and release. Providing the infrastructure to efficiently transfer multiple preclinical stage lead molecules into manufacturing avoiding costly commitments of funds before clinical data are available. We leverage third-party contract manufacturers for fill-finish, assembly, label, pack operations and distribution.
Our manufacturing capabilities encompass the full manufacturing process through quality control and quality assurance. This structure enables us to efficiently transfer preclinical stage lead molecules into manufacturing. We have designed our manufacturing facility and processes to provide maximum flexibility and rapid change over for the manufacture of different therapeutic candidates. We outsource fill-finish, packaging, labeling, shipping, and distribution.
For our early phase therapeutic candidates, we intend to continue to manufacture drug substance for preclinical testing and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical development at our current facilities, and use third-party contract manufacturers as needed. For the REBLOZYL Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial supply, we have transferred the process for production to BMS under the terms of our collaboration agreement, and BMS uses third-party contract manufacturers. For additional sotatercept clinical trials and commercial supply in the PH field, we intend to use third-party contract manufacturers. 
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, the company employed 312 full-time employees. 
Attraction and Recruitment
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses. We offer a competitive benefits package to promote employee well-being across all facets of their lives, including health care, retirement planning, and paid time off. 
Recognizing the achievements of our employees is important to Acceleron. We realize that Acceleron’s employees work hard throughout the year to achieve the Company’s goals. Our annual TEAM-ACE Awards recognize employees who embody our core values: Team Collaboration, Accelerating Drug Discovery, Commitment to Patients, and Employee Development. The program provides an opportunity for fellow employees to reward their peers who work alongside them and go above and beyond to contribute to Acceleron’s success while demonstrating Acceleron’s core values. We also recognize team achievement with our Quarterly Team Awards and multiple individual spot awards programs (“Note of Thanks”, “Above and Beyond”, and “Major Impact”).
We employ a variety of tools to facilitate open and direct communication including open forums with executives, employee surveys, focus groups, town halls and committees. We endeavor to further refine our employee programs through our annual employee engagement survey.
Employee Retention and Engagement
Employee retention and turnover rates are monitored monthly by the human resources team. We analyze our results and compare our metrics to industry benchmarks. During 2020, our voluntary turnover rate was lower than industry average. We also conduct an annual employee engagement survey to receive feedback on the level of employee engagement and satisfaction.
Diversity and Inclusion
A diverse and inclusive workforce is a business imperative and key to our long-term success. To champion our efforts in this area, our Director of Talent Management and Inclusion & Diversity monitors Acceleron’s diversity and inclusion practices which ensures continuous dialogue on the topic with our CEO and Executive Committee. Acceleron values diversity and inclusion and undertakes various efforts throughout its operations to promote these initiatives. Our current efforts are focused around a safe work environment, equal employment opportunity, and commitment to our community. 
Conduct and Ethics
At Acceleron, we are committed to fostering a culture of integrity and ensuring each of our employees is equipped with resources to help them do the right thing. We believe it is imperative that the board of directors and senior management strongly support a no-tolerance stance for workplace harassment, biases and unethical behavior. All employees are required to abide by, review and confirm compliance to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Insider Trading policies upon hire and on an annual basis thereafter.
Response to COVID-19
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority and in particular, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have supported our employees and government efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic through a multifaceted communication, infrastructure, and behavior modification and enforcement effort. We convened a committee comprised of physicians and other scientists that provides guidance while continuously monitoring the pandemic. The following outlines the primary actions recommended by this committee:
•Established clear and regular COVID-19 policies, safety protocols, and updates to all employees;
•Decreased density and configured work areas to enable physical distancing for onsite employees and staggered shifts to minimize human contact; 
•Upgraded HVAC systems for maximum air flow;
•Enhanced flexibility policies for those working from home; 
•Adjusted our sick leave policy to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
