ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
GENERAL
​
Atlantic Power, a corporation continued under the laws of British Columbia, Canada is an independent power producer that owns power generation assets in eleven states in the United States and two provinces in Canada. We were incorporated in 2004. Our power generation projects, which are diversified by geography, fuel type, dispatch profile and offtaker, sell electricity to utilities and other large customers predominantly under long-term PPAs, which seek to minimize exposure to changes in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of twenty-one operating projects with an aggregate electric generating capacity of approximately 1,723 megawatts (“MW”) on a gross ownership basis and approximately 1,327 MW on a net ownership basis. Sixteen of the projects are majority-owned by the Company. 
​
The following charts show, based on generation capacity in MW, the diversification of our portfolio by geography and fuel type for our projects currently in operation:
​
​
We sell the majority of the capacity and energy from our power generation projects under PPAs to a variety of utilities and other parties. Under the PPAs, which have expiration dates ranging from September 2021 to November 2043, we receive payments for electric energy sold to our customers (known as energy payments), in addition to payments for electric generation capacity (known as capacity payments). We also sell steam from a number of our projects to industrial purchasers under steam sales agreements. Sales of electricity are generally higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating.
​
We directly operate and maintain the majority of our power generation projects. We also partner with recognized leaders in the independent power industry to operate and maintain our other projects, including CMS Energy Corporation (“CMS”), Heorot Power Management LLC (“Heorot”) and Purenergy LLC (“Purenergy”). Under these operation, maintenance and management agreements, the operator is typically responsible for operations, maintenance and repair services.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The acquisition of Atlantic Power's outstanding common shares and the redemption of the outstanding preferred shares of APPEL would be completed by way of a plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). In connection with the Arrangement, Atlantic Power's shareholder rights plan would be terminated and all rights to purchase Atlantic Power's common shares issued pursuant to the shareholder rights plan would be cancelled.
​
The Arrangement Agreement
​
The Arrangement Agreement provides that the Transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions, including court approval of the Arrangement, regulatory approvals (including under the Competition Act (Canada), which approval was obtained by the parties on February 2, 2021, and the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the Federal Power Act, as amended), as well as the receipt of certain third-party consents.
​
The Transaction is also conditional on the approval of two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of Atlantic Power's common shares voting in person or by proxy at a special meeting of Atlantic Power's common shareholders and the approval of two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of APPEL’s preferred shares (voting as a single class) in person or by proxy at a meeting of APPEL’s preferred shareholders in respect of both the Arrangement and the proposed continuance of APPEL under the laws of British Columbia. The Transaction must also be approved by a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting of Atlantic Power’s common shareholders, excluding votes attached to common shares held by persons described in items (a) through (d) of Section 8.1(2) of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions.

In addition, the Transaction is conditional upon the approval of the holders of the convertible debentures and the MTNs, respectively (in each case either by way of votes of the holders of the convertible debentures and the MTNs holding at least two-thirds of the principal amount of the convertible debentures and the MTNs, respectively, voted in person or by proxy at separate meetings of the holders of the convertible debentures and the MTNs or by way of separate written consents of the holders of the convertible debentures and the MTNs holding not less than two-thirds of the principal amount of convertible debentures and MTNs outstanding, as applicable), of certain amendments to the trust indentures governing such securities, including to provide for the mandatory conversion of the convertible debentures into common shares; the addition of a redemption obligation of Atlantic Power, conditional on the closing of the Transaction, to redeem all outstanding MTNs for consideration equal to 106.701% of the principal amount of such MTNs; and the modification of the redemption notice period as to the MTNs. Atlantic Power and APLP will seek the approval of the holders of the convertible debentures and MTNs by way of separate meetings and/or consent solicitations.
​
A bondholder representing approximately 66% of the principal amount of MTNs and approximately 19% of the principal amount of convertible debentures outstanding has agreed to vote in favor of or otherwise consent to amendments to the trust indentures governing those securities.
​
The Arrangement Agreement is subject to customary non-solicitation provisions, including Atlantic Power's right to consider and accept unsolicited superior proposals in certain circumstances, subject to a right to match in favor of the Purchasers. A termination fee of $12.5 million will be payable by Atlantic Power to the Purchasers should the Transaction not close under certain circumstances, including if the Arrangement is not completed as a result of Atlantic Power accepting an unsolicited superior proposal. A reverse termination fee of $15 million will be payable by the Purchasers to Atlantic Power should the Transaction not close as a result of an uncured breach by the Purchasers of the Arrangement Agreement (provided Atlantic Power is not then in breach of the Arrangement Agreement).

​
BUSINESS STRATEGY
​
This section describes our business strategy without regards to potential effects of the Transaction except where stated otherwise.
​
Our primary business is the acquisition, operation and ownership of power plants in the United States and Canada. The power generation business is cyclical, capital-intensive, heavily regulated and commodity-priced. In executing our strategy, we are focused on the following priorities: 

7



​

● | Capital allocation framework: We are focused on enhancing shareholder value while balancing risk and reward. The key metric that we consider is the impact of capital allocation on our estimates of intrinsic value per share. Developing these estimates is a complex process that relies on inherently uncertain forecasts of power prices, market prices for assets, interest rates and other major factors outside of our control. We use these estimates to provide us a rough guideline on how we can best impact intrinsic value per share via capital allocation. Over the past six years we have invested discretionary capital in internal investments in our fleet, external acquisitions, repurchases of debt, common equity and preferred equity securities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Proposed Sale of the Company – As discussed above under “I Squared Capital Transaction”, should the Transaction close, common shareholders will receive $3.03 per common share in cash.​
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Share repurchases – We have returned cash to shareholders via common share repurchases, as we do not believe reinstating a common dividend would be consistent with the characteristics of our business model or current market conditions. Our key consideration in share repurchases (either common or preferred) is the price-to-value relationship. We are willing to buy shares when doing so is accretive to our estimates of intrinsic value per share. We are not interested in buying common shares above our estimates of intrinsic value per share. We have repurchased preferred shares when we believed the cash returns were attractive. During 2020, we used $48 million of our discretionary capital to repurchase and cancel common ($41.6 million) and preferred (US$6.4 million equivalent) shares at prices that we believe were attractive relative to our estimates of value.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Internal investments - Given the challenging supply and demand conditions in the power sector in the United States and Canada, low returns currently available on contracted power assets, and the superior returns that generally have been available on our internal uses of capital, we have allocated the majority of our discretionary capital to investments in our fleet and share repurchases. We invested $25 million to optimize our existing fleet in 2013 through 2016.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | External investments - We invest externally only when we believe the returns are superior to those we can achieve by investing internally in plants or in share repurchases. In 2018 and 2019, we made our first significant external investments in more than five years, totaling approximately $45 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Debt reduction: We have reduced our consolidated debt by more than $1.3 billion in the past seven years. By significantly repaying debt, we have strengthened our balance sheet, improved our financial flexibility and reduced our cash interest payments. We also have improved our credit profile, as reflected in two rating upgrades since October 2015 from each of S&P and Moody’s. Debt reduction is not driven by the returns available on our debt, but rather the priority of strengthening our balance sheet. We believe this is prudent given the nature of our business, our asset profile and the state of the power markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Cost management: As our industry lacks barriers to entry, we are keenly focused on efficiency and costs. Our existing fleet is, on average, comprised of older, smaller and less efficient plants, which limits our ability to achieve operating cost reductions. We have reduced our corporate overhead structure significantly and continue to maintain a culture of frugality.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Culture: We are laser focused on shareholder value. Being a good corporate citizen underpins that focus but we also do not want to force our personal political views onto our employees or shareholders. In a commodity business, operating our plants safely and staying focused on costs are paramount. In all aspects of our business, we strive to follow a philosophy of servant leadership.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Balanced portfolio: We have a balanced portfolio of technologies and fuel types including natural gas, biomass and hydro, and we own an equity interest in one coal plant. This balance creates some natural hedging characteristics. For example, higher gas prices may be beneficial for hydro plants but not necessarily for gas plants.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | PPA renewals: We seek to renew or extend expiring PPAs where economically feasible, or make alternative arrangements where possible. PPAs in our portfolio have expiration dates ranging from September 2021 to November 2043. We plan for PPA expirations by evaluating various options in the market. New arrangements may involve responses to utility solicitations for capacity and energy, direct negotiations with the original purchasing utility for PPA extensions, approaches by the projects to likely bilateral counterparties, including traditional PPAs, tolling agreements with creditworthy energy trading firms or the use of derivatives to lock in value. The current market for PPAs is challenging. When a PPA expires or is terminated, it is possible that the price received by the project for power under subsequent arrangements, if any, may be reduced and in some cases, significantly. We do not assume that revenues or operating margins under existing PPAs will necessarily be sustained after PPA expirations, since most original PPAs included capacity payments related to return of and return on original capital invested, and counterparties or evolving regional electricity markets may or may not provide similar payments under new or extended PPAs. Our projects may not be able to secure a new agreement and could be exposed to selling power at spot market prices. It is possible that subsequent PPAs or the spot markets may not be available at prices that permit the operation of the project on a profitable basis, which may result in our decision to mothball or retire the project. For the status of description of some of our PPAs and related renegotiations, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The expiration or termination of our PPAs could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”

​
ASSET MANAGEMENT
​
Our asset management strategy is to manage our physical assets and commercial relationships with the goal of increasing shareholder value. We proactively seek scale opportunities and to establish best practices that result in EBITDA and cash flow growth across all of our twenty-one operating plants. Our asset management group works to ensure that our projects receive appropriate preventative and corrective maintenance and incur capital expenditures to provide for their safety, efficiency, availability, flexibility, longevity, and growth in EBITDA contribution. We also proactively look for opportunities to optimize power purchase, fuel supply, long-term service and other agreements to deliver strong and predictable financial performance. The teams at each of the businesses have extensive experience in managing, operating and maintaining the assets.
​
For operations and maintenance services at the five projects in our portfolio which we do not operate, we partner with experienced operators in the independent power business. Examples of our third-party operators include CMS, Heorot and Purenergy, which are experienced, well regarded energy infrastructure management services companies. In addition, employees of Atlantic Power with significant experience managing similar assets are involved in all significant decisions with the objective of proactively identifying value-creating opportunities such as contract renewals or restructurings, asset-level refinancings, add-on acquisitions, divestitures and participation at partnership meetings and calls.
​
INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION
​
The electric power industry is one of the largest industries in the United States, generating annualized retail electricity sales of approximately $400 billion, based on information published by the Energy Information Administration. A significant portion of the power produced in the United States and Canada is generated by non-utility generators. According to the Energy Information Administration, independent power producers represented approximately 42% of total net generation in 2020. Independent power producers sell the electricity that they generate to electric utilities and other load-serving entities (such as municipalities and electric cooperatives) by way of bilateral contracts or open power exchanges. The electric utilities and other load-serving entities, in turn, generally sell this electricity to industrial, commercial and residential customers. In the independent power generation sector, electricity is generated from a number of energy sources, including natural gas, coal, water, waste products such as biomass (e.g., wood, wood waste, agricultural waste), landfill gas, geothermal, solar and wind. All of our plants are non-utility electric generating facilities in the North American electrical power generation industry.
​
The power generation industry is characterized by intense competition, and we compete with utilities, industrial companies, yieldcos and other independent power producers. Historically low crude oil and natural gas prices as well as

decreased rates of demand growth have contributed to reduced capacity and energy prices and increasing competition among generators to obtain power sales agreements. We also compete for acquisition and joint-venture opportunities with numerous private equity, infrastructure and pension funds, Canadian and U.S. independent power firms, utility non-regulated subsidiaries and other strategic and financial players.
​
Our competitive strengths
​
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
​

● | Diversified projects. Our power generation projects in operation or under contract have an aggregate gross electric generation capacity of approximately 1,723 MW, and our net ownership interest in these projects is approximately 1,327 MW at December 31, 2020. These projects are diversified by fuel type, electricity and steam customers, technologies, project operators and geography. The majority are located in the U.S. Eastern, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, and in Canada in the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Experienced management team. Our management team has a depth of experience in commercial power operations and maintenance, project development, asset management, mergers and acquisitions, capital raising and management and financial controls.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Stability of project cash flow. Many of our power generation projects currently in operation have been in operation for more than ten years. Cash flows from each project are generally supported by PPAs with investment-grade utilities and other creditworthy counterparties. We aim to stabilize operating margins through a combination of a project’s PPAs, fuel supply agreements and/or commodity hedges, when possible.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Strong in-house operations and asset management teams. We manage the operations of sixteen of our twenty-one operating power generation projects, which represent approximately 62% of our portfolio’s total net generating capacity. The remaining five generation projects are operated by third parties, which are recognized leaders in the independent power business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
OUR ORGANIZATION AND SEGMENTS
​
The following tables outline by segment our portfolio of power generating assets in operation as of December 31, 2020, including our interest in each facility. We believe our portfolio is well diversified in terms of electricity and steam customers, fuel type, regulatory jurisdictions and regional power pools, thereby partially mitigating exposure to market, regulatory or environmental conditions specific to any single region.
​
We have four reportable segments: Solid Fuel, Natural Gas, Hydroelectric and Corporate. We revised our reportable business segments in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the result of recent asset acquisitions, PPA expirations and project decommissioning, and in order to align with changes to management's structure, resource allocation and performance assessment in making decisions regarding our operations. Segment information for prior periods has been revised to conform to the new segment presentation. The segment classified as Corporate (formally Un-Allocated Corporate) includes activities that support the executive and administrative offices, capital structure and costs of being a public registrant. These costs are not allocated to the operating segments when determining segment profit or loss. We have previously reported our segments on a geographic basis, and consequently the segment information presented herein is significantly different than previous presentations of segment information.
​
The sections below provide descriptions of our projects as they are aligned in our segment reporting structure for financial reporting purposes.

​
Solid Fuel Segment
​
Our Solid Fuel segment accounted for approximately 13% and 29% of consolidated revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and total net generation capacity of 376 MW at December 31, 2020. Set forth below is a list of our Solid Fuel projects in operation at December 31, 2020:

​
Non-operating Natural Gas Plants
​
In August 2018, we terminated discussions with the Navy regarding site control for our Naval Station, Naval Training Center (“NTC”) and North Island projects located in San Diego, California. We are in the process of decommissioning all three sites, which is a requirement of our land use agreements with the Navy. We anticipate

decommissioning will be completed in the second quarter of 2021.
​
Our Kapuskasing and North Bay projects are both 40 MW natural gas plants located in the Province of Ontario. These projects formerly had PPAs with the OEFC that expired in December 2017. These plants are currently being maintained, but do not operate because they do not have PPAs or a merchant market where operations would be profitable.

​
REGULATORY MATTERS
​
Overview
​
Our facilities and operations are subject to laws and regulations that govern, among other things, transactions by and with purchasers of power, including utility companies, the development and construction of generation facilities, the ownership and operations of generation facilities, access to transmission, and the geographical location, zoning, land use and operation aspects of our facilities and properties, including environmental matters.
​
In the United States, the power generation and sale aspects of our projects are primarily regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), although most of our projects benefit from the special provisions accorded to Qualifying Facilities (“QFs”) or Exempt Wholesale Generators (“EWGs”).
​
In Canada, electricity generation is subject primarily to provincial regulation. Our projects in British Columbia are therefore subject to different regulatory regimes from our projects in Ontario. Regulation of related environmental 

13



matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and green building standards, are subject to federal, provincial and municipal regulation.
​
Generating projects
United States
​
Thirteen of our power generating projects are QFs under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (“PURPA”), and FERC regulations. A QF falls into one or both of two primary classes, both of which would facilitate one of PURPA’s goals to more efficiently use fossil fuels to generate electricity than typical utility plants. The first class of QFs includes energy producers that generate power using renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, biomass or waste fuels. The second class of QFs includes cogeneration facilities, which must meet specific fossil fuel efficiency requirements by producing both electricity and steam versus electricity only.
​
The generating projects with QF status are currently party to a PPA with a utility or have been granted authority to charge market-based rates or are exempt from FERC rate-making authority. The FERC has granted thirteen of the projects the authority to charge market-based rates based primarily on a finding that the projects lack market power. The projects with QF status are also exempt from state regulation respecting the rates of electric utilities and the financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities. However, state regulators may review the prudency of utilities entering into PPAs with QFs and the siting of the generation facilities. The majority of our generation is sold by QFs under PPAs that required approval by state authorities.
​
PURPA, as initially implemented by the FERC, generally required that vertically integrated electric utilities purchase power from QFs at their avoided costs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EP Act of 2005”), however, established new limits on PURPA’s requirement that electric utilities buy electricity from QFs to certain markets that lack competitive characteristics. The projects with EWG status are also exempt from state regulation respecting the rates of electric utilities.
​
Notwithstanding their status as QFs and EWGs, our projects remain subject to various aspects of FERC regulation, including those relating to power marketer status and to oversight of mergers, acquisitions and investments relating to utilities under the Federal Power Act, as amended by the EP Act of 2005. Nine of our projects are also subject to reliability standards developed and enforced by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”). NERC is a not-for-profit regulatory authority whose mission is to assure the reliability and security of the bulk power system in North America.
​
Pursuant to its authority, NERC has issued, and the FERC has approved, a series of mandatory reliability standards. Users, owners and operators of the bulk power system can be penalized significantly for failing to comply with the FERC-approved reliability standards. We have designated our Manager of Operational and Regulatory Compliance to oversee compliance with reliability standards and an outside law firm specializing in this area advises us on FERC and NERC compliance, including annual compliance training for relevant employees.
​
British Columbia, Canada
​
The vast majority of British Columbia’s power is generated or procured by BC Hydro, which is one of the largest electric utilities in Canada. BC Hydro is owned by the Province of British Columbia and is regulated by the British Columbia Utilities Commission (the “BCUC”), which is governed by the Utilities Commission Act (British Columbia) (the “UCA”). The BCUC is also responsible for the regulation of British Columbia’s public energy utilities including publicly-owned and investor-owned utilities (i.e., independent power producers).
​
BC Hydro is generally required to acquire all new power (beyond what it already generates from existing BC Hydro plants) from independent power producers.
​
All contracts for electricity supply, including those between independent power producers and BC Hydro, must be filed with and approved by the BCUC. In making its determination, the BCUC will examine whether the contract is 

14



in the public interest. The BCUC may hold a hearing in this regard. Furthermore, the BCUC may make rules governing conditions to be contained in agreements entered into by public utilities for electricity.
​
Pursuant to the UCA, the BCUC has adopted the standards developed by the NERC and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) in respect to all generators of electricity in British Columbia, including independent power producers. As a practical matter, the BCUC appointed WECC as Administrator to assist the BCUC in carrying out the registration of parties and compliance monitoring. 
​
The Clean Energy Act (the “Clean Energy Act”), which became law in 2010, sets out British Columbia’s energy objectives. The Clean Energy Act states, among other things, that British Columbia aims to accelerate and expand the development of clean and renewable energy sources in British Columbia to, among other things, promote economic development and job creation and continue to work toward the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation also explicitly states that British Columbia will encourage the use of waste heat, biogas and biomass to reduce waste. Clean Energy Production in B.C.: An Inter-Agency Guidebook for Project Development, which was released by the provincial government in 2016, is consistent with the Clean Energy Act and favors clean and renewable energy sources such as waterpower, windpower and ocean energy generation. 
​
Other provincial regulators in British Columbia having authority over independent power producers include Technical Safety BC, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, and the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation.
​
Ontario, Canada
​
In Ontario, the Ontario Energy Board (“OEB”) is an administrative tribunal with overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of the natural gas and electricity industries in Ontario and with the authority to grant or renew, and set the terms for, licenses with respect to electricity generation facilities, including our projects.
​
No person is permitted to own or operate large or medium-scale electricity generation facilities in Ontario without a license from the OEB.
​
The OEB’s general functions include:
​

● | Determination of the rates charged for regulated services in the electricity sector;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Licensing of market participants;
--+----------------------------------


● | Inspections, particularly with respect to compelling production of records and information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Market monitoring and reporting, including on anti-competitive practice;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer advocacy; and
--+-----------------------


● | Enforcement and compliance.
--+----------------------------

The OEB has the authority effectively to modify licenses by adopting “codes” that are deemed to form part of the licenses. Furthermore, any violations of the license or other irregularities in the relationship with the OEB can result in administrative monetary penalties of up to Cdn$1 million per day of violation, license revocation and other consequences. While the OEB provides reports to the Ontario Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, it generally operates independently from the government. However, the Minister may issue policy directives (with Cabinet approval) concerning general policy and the objectives to be pursued by the OEB, and the OEB is required to implement such policy directives. The law implemented by the OEB has been the subject of relatively frequent change, which has contributed to regulatory uncertainty. 
​
A number of other regulators and quasi-governmental entities play a role in electricity regulation in Ontario, 

15



including the Independent Electricity System Operator (“IESO”), Hydro One, the Electrical Safety Authority (“ESA”) and the Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation (“OEFC”).
​
In 1998, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the Energy Competition Act of 1998, which authorized the establishment of a market in electricity, and reorganized Ontario Hydro into five companies: Ontario Power Generation Inc. (“OPG”), the Ontario Hydro Services Company (later renamed Hydro One), the Independent Electricity Market Operator (later renamed the IESO), the ESA, and OEFC. The two commercial companies, Ontario Power Generation Inc. and Hydro One, were intended to eventually operate as private businesses rather than as crown corporations. The Province currently owns slightly less than half of the equity of Hydro One Inc., a publicly traded corporation. Hydro One has been the subject of intervention by the Province of Ontario, including pressuring the retirement of its former chief executive officer and resignation of its entire board of directors.
​
The IESO is responsible for administering the wholesale electricity market and controlling Ontario’s transmission grid. The IESO is a non-profit corporation. Its directors are appointed by the government of Ontario. The IESO’s “Market Rules” form the regulatory framework for the operation of Ontario’s transmission grid and electricity market. The Market Rules require, among other things, that generators meet certain equipment and performance standards and certain system reliability obligations. The IESO may enforce the Market Rules by imposing financial penalties. The IESO may also terminate, suspend or restrict participatory rights, and has an enforcement arm.
​
In November 2006, the IESO entered into a memorandum of understanding with NERC, in which it recognized NERC as the “electricity reliability organization” in Ontario. In addition, the IESO has also entered into a similar MOU with both the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (the “NPCC”) and NERC. The IESO is accountable to NERC and NPCC for compliance with NERC and NPCC reliability standards. Although the IESO may impose Ontario-specific reliability standards, such standards must be consistent with, and at least as stringent as, NERC’s and NPCC’s standards. Effective July 1, 2016, the IESO changed the definition of what generating facilities are considered part of the Bulk Electric System (“BES”). Any new facility grouped into the BES, which includes all Ontario sites except Kapuskasing, will have to comply with all NERC reliability standards in effect in Ontario. As of January 1, 2015, the IESO is responsible for procuring new electricity generation. As a result, the IESO enters into electricity generation contracts with electricity generators in Ontario from time to time. The IESO also administers the Ontario Reliability Compliance Program, working with various market participants to ensure they understand and adhere to their obligations to comply with NERC standards and NPCC criteria.
​
Although the Green Energy Act became law in Ontario in 2009 for renewable electricity generation technologies, including via a feed-in tariff program, this statute was repealed as of January 1, 2019 with the introduction and proclamation of the Green Energy Repeal Act, 2018. This Act amended provisions of the Electricity Act, 1998, as well as the Environmental Protection Act, and the Planning Act, among others. In particular, amendments to the Environmental Protection Act now provide that, absent a demonstrated demand for the electricity that would be generated by a given renewable energy project, the provincial government is empowered to prohibit the issuance or renewal of energy approvals for any such project. Amendments to the Planning Act now stipulate that there is no appeal route in respect of any refusal or failure to adopt an amendment authorizing a renewable energy undertaking, except by the Minister. Further amendments provide that there is now no appeal route in respect of all or any part of an application for amendment to a by-law if the amendment proposes to permit a renewable energy undertaking, except by the Minister. The provincial government has stated that the repeal of the Green Energy Act will empower individual municipalities to make planning decisions related to the development of new energy projects. In July of 2018, the provincial government cancelled hundreds of renewable energy contracts in the province. In the related Minister’s Directive, the Minister noted that the IESO’s recent system planning work “indicates that Ontario’s current contracted and rate regulated electricity resources are sufficient to satisfy or exceed forecasted provincial needs for the near term and that there are other means of meeting future energy supply and capacity needs at materially lower costs than long-term contracts that lock in the prices paid for these resources.”
​
Carbon emissions
United States – regional and state
​

16



In the United States, during the past several years government actions addressing carbon emissions have occurred primarily at the regional and state levels. Beginning in 2009, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”) was established by certain Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states as the first cap-and-trade program in the United States for CO2 emissions. CO2 allowances are now a tradable commodity in the RGGI states. The nine states currently participating in RGGI have varied implementation plans and schedules. RGGI implemented a new, reduced CO2 cap in 2014, with further reductions of 2.5% each year from 2015 to 2020. On January 1, 2020, New Jersey rejoined RGGI after withdrawing from the compact in 2012. Our Chambers project operates in the state of New Jersey and is subject to RGGI. However, its PPA is grandfathered to provide some cost mitigation under the law. California’s cap-and-trade program governing greenhouse gas emissions became effective for the electricity sector on January 1, 2013. California, along with British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Quebec, is part of the Western Climate Initiative, which supports the implementation of state and provincial greenhouse gas emissions trading programs. Other states and regions in the United States have considered similar regulations, and it is possible that federal climate legislation will be established in the future.
​
In 2006, the State of California passed legislation initiating two programs to control/reduce the creation of greenhouse gases. The two laws are more commonly known as AB 32 (the Global Warming Solutions Act) and SB 1368. In 2016, California enacted SB 32, which expanded the requirements of AB 32. Under AB 32 and SB 32, the California Air Resources Board (the “CARB”) is required to adopt a greenhouse gas emissions cap on all major sources (not limited to the electric sector) to achieve goals of reaching (i) 1990 greenhouse gas emissions levels by the year 2020, (ii) 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and (iii) 80% below 1990 emissions levels by 2050. Under the CARB regulations that took effect on January 1, 2013, electricity generators and certain other facilities are now subject to an allowance for greenhouse gas emissions, with allowances allocated by both formulas set by the CARB and auctions.
​
SB 1368 added the requirement that the California Energy Commission, in consultation with the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) and the CARB, establish greenhouse gas emission performance standards and implement regulations for PPAs with a term of five or more years entered into prospectively by publicly owned electric utilities. The legislation directs the California Energy Commission to establish the performance standard as one not exceeding the rate of greenhouse gas emitted per megawatt hour (“MWh”) associated with combined-cycle, gas turbine baseload generation.
​
United States – Federal
​
Over the past several years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken a number of actions respecting CO2 emissions. The EPA’s actions include its December 2009 finding of “endangerment” to public health and welfare from greenhouse gases, its issuance in September 2009 of the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule which required large sources, including power plants, to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA annually beginning in 2011, and its issuance in May 2010 of its final Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which under a phased-in approach requires large industrial facilities, including power plants, to obtain permits to emit, and to use best available control technology to curb emissions of, greenhouse gases. In addition, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final rule regulating carbon emissions from existing electric generating units, which is referred to as the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”). As a result of judicial challenge, however, the CPP was not implemented. In June 2019, the EPA issued the final Affordable Clean Energy Rule (“ACE”), which repealed the CPP and established emissions guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded ACE. Provided the Supreme Court does not decide to take up the case, the Biden Administration’s EPA will be able to focus on constructing a replacement. 
​
In January 2021, the Biden Administration signed multiple executive orders related to the climate and environment. These executive orders direct federal agencies to review and reverse more than 100 Trump Administration actions on the environment, instruct the Director of National Intelligence to prepare a national intelligence estimate on the security implications of the climate crisis and direct all agencies to develop strategies for integrating climate considerations into their international work, establish the National Climate Task Force which assembles leaders from across 21 federal agencies and departments, commit to environmental justice and new, clean infrastructure projects, kick off development of emissions reduction target and establish the special presidential envoy for climate on the National 

17



Security Council. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these executive actions or any legal challenges to these actions.
​
Canada - Federal
​
In Canada, the federal government has implemented greenhouse gas reporting regulations and is developing additional programs to address greenhouse gas emissions. Under the 2004 federal Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Program (“GHGRP”), all facilities which emit 50,000 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2eq”) per year are required to submit reports on their emissions to Environment Canada.
​
On October 3, 2016, the Government of Canada announced its proposed pan-Canadian approach for the pricing of carbon pollution. On January 15, 2018, the Government of Canada released the draft Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, consisting of two mechanisms: (1) a regulatory charge on fuels, and (2) an emissions trading system referred to as the Output-Based Pricing System (“OBPS”). These mechanisms establish a backstop carbon price in provinces that have not implemented, by January 1, 2019, a carbon pricing system that the federal government has determined complies with its carbon pricing requirements. Other policy documents accompanying the Act also included a proposed design of rules to enhance market liquidity. In May 2018, the federal Government published “Carbon pricing: compliance options under the federal output-based pricing system,” a document that describes the proposed rules, and on June 21, 2018 the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act went into effect. Since that time the federal government has published several regulations, including the Fuel Charge Regulations and the Output-Based Pricing System Regulations to implement both mechanisms.
British Columbia and Québec have compliant carbon pricing systems in place and are not expected to be subject to the federal backstop regime. Alberta is exempt from parts of the federal backstop regime. Beginning on January 1, 2020, the federal backstop regime imposed a minimum Cdn$30/tonne of CO2e (“tCO2e”) carbon price for greenhouse gases that exceed a prescribed emissions limit set out in the Output-Based Pricing System Regulations, increasing by Cdn$10 increments each following year to 2023. 
​
Although at the beginning of 2017, Ontario had implemented a compliant cap and trade system, there was a change in the provincial government as a result of the election held in June 2018. The then newly elected Ontario government cancelled the cap and trade regulation and prohibited all trading of emission allowances, effective as of July 3, 2018, and on October 31, 2018 formally repealed the cap-and- trade legislation. As a result, our Ontario operations are now currently subject to the federal backstop regime. This means that large industrial emitters in Ontario, such as our operations in Tunis and Nipigon, are currently subject to the federal OBPS provided for in Part 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act. As of July 4, 2019, Ontario has also established its own output-based performance standards for large emitters through Ontario Regulation 241/19: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Performance Standards (“GHGEPS”). The GHGEPS, while currently optional for facilities covered under the federal GHGRP emitting between 10,000 and 50,000 tonnes of CO2e, appears to be similar to the federal OBPS. On September 20, 2020, the federal government accepted the GHGEPS as an equivalent program, which will exempt Ontario facilities from the federal backstop regime once in force. The implications of the federal OBPS and the GHGEPS for our operations in Ontario, such as Tunis and Nipigon, are discussed below (in the section on Canada – Ontario).
​
The validity of the federal backstop regime is being challenged on constitutional grounds by Alberta, Ontario and Saskatchewan. The Courts of Appeal in Ontario and Saskatchewan have held that the federal backstop regime is constitutional, while the Alberta Court of Appeal found that the federal backstop regime was unconstitutional. Canada’s highest court, the Supreme Court of Canada (“SCC”), heard the three provincial challenges in September 2020. The provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Quebec joined the proceedings as interveners. The SCC reserved judgement after hearing the appeals and, to date, has not rendered a decision. If the SCC finds that the federal backstop regime is constitutional, then the federal backstop regime will continue to apply as described in this section.
​
In December 2020, the federal government announced that the OBPS charge will increase by $15 per tonne in each year after 2023 until the charge hits $170 per tonne in 2030. If provincial regimes do not match this price, then they may no longer be deemed to be equivalent and the federal backstop regime could continue to apply.

​
Canada – British Columbia
​
The Government of British Columbia has enacted a number of significant pieces of climate action legislation that frame British Columbia’s approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the goal of supporting its participation in the emerging low-carbon economy.
​
One key piece of legislation is the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act, which was re-enacted in November 2018 as the Climate Change Accountability Act (British Columbia) (“CCAA”), which sets legislated targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in British Columbia. Using 2007 as a base year, CCAA (along with related Ministerial Orders) requires that emissions must be reduced by a minimum of 40% by 2030, 60% by 2040 and 80% by 2050. The Province has also introduced an interim target of 16% by 2025 and will set sectoral targets by March 2021. Also required in connection with CCAA are (from 2020 onward) British Columbia Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reports (reports are prepared in even-numbered years and tables are updated in odd-numbered years) and Community Energy and Emissions Inventory Reports (prepared every two years), all of which are designed to provide scientific, comparable and consistent reporting of greenhouse gas sources.
​
Other related, key pieces of legislation include the Carbon Tax Act (“CTA”) and the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act (“GGIRCA”). CTA operates to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions, providing an incentive for sustainable choices and practices by producers of greenhouse gases. GGIRCA came into force on January 1, 2016 and combined several pieces of British Columbia's existing greenhouse gas legislation into a single legislative framework. It includes the ability to set a greenhouse gas emissions intensity benchmark for regulated industries and enables the benchmark to be met through flexible options, such as purchasing offsets or paying a set price per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions that would be dedicated to a technology fund. Three regulations necessary to implement GGIRCA also came into force on January 1, 2016: the Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting Regulation (“GGERR”), the Greenhouse Gas Emission Administrative Penalties and Appeals Regulation (“GGEAPAR”) and the Greenhouse Gas Emission Control Regulation (“GGECR”). GGERR establishes compliance reporting requirements and ensures that industrial operations that emit more than 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalent tonnes per year report their greenhouse gas pollution each year. GGEAPAR establishes the process for when, how much, and under what conditions administrative penalties may be levied for non-compliance with GGIRCA or the regulations made under GGIRCA. GGECR establishes the BC Carbon Registry and sets criteria for developing emission offsets issued by the provincial government. GGECR also establishes the price for funded units issued under GGIRCA that would go towards a technology fund. Regulated operations will purchase offsets from the market or funded units from government to meet emission limits. Funded unit revenue that goes to a technology fund will also support the development of clean technologies with significant potential to reduce British Columbia's emissions over the long term.

Canada - Ontario
​
In a news release issued on June 15, 2018, Ontario Premier-designate Doug Ford announced that the first act of his newly formed government would be to cancel Ontario’s cap and trade program (under the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016). Effective as of July 3, 2018, the Ontario government cancelled the cap and trade regulation and prohibited all trading of emissions allowances, and on October 31, 2018 formally repealed the Ontario cap-and-trade legislation. Bill 4: Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, 2018 (the legislation which repealed the former cap-and-trade regime) retired or cancelled outstanding emissions allowances and strictly limited the ability of those holding emissions allowances to bring claims seeking to recover for any damages suffered as a result.
​
Under the previous cap-and-trade regime, facilities in Ontario with annual greenhouse gas emissions of 25,000 tonnes or more were generally required by law to participate in the regime by obtaining emissions allowances. However, facilities which primarily generate electricity using natural gas from a local distributor were excluded from the requirement to obtain emission allowances and instead participated in the program through the payment of the carbon price charged by the local natural gas distributor on the natural gas delivered after the end of 2016. As a result, our operations in Ontario were not holding emissions allowances when the Ontario cap and trade program was cancelled and were not adversely affected by the cancellation of that regime.
​
As a result of the cancellation of the Ontario cap-and-trade regime, on January 1, 2019 our operations in 

19



Nipigon and Tunis became subject to the federal OBPS. Under the federal “Notice Establishing Criteria Respecting Facilities and Persons and Publishing Measures: SOR/2018-213”, as it read before its repeal, any facility which emitted more than 50kt of CO2e during any of the 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017 calendar years, and which carries out, as its primary activity, the generation of electricity using fossil fuels, is a covered facility and subject to the OBPS. Since the Nipigon and Tunis projects are each generating electricity using natural gas and each reported emissions in excess of 50kt of CO2e for one of the 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017 calendar years (119,248 tonnes for 2014 in the case of Tunis and 115,725 tonnes for 2016 in the case of Nipigon), each is considered a covered facility and currently subject to the federal OBPS and required to pay fees as described below.
​
Our operations in Ontario may also be subject to Ontario’s GHGPE, as it comes into force. Under Ontario’s GHGPE, facilities must register with the Director of the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks if the facility is required to submit a report under the federal GHGRP and reported emissions of more than 50,000 tonnes of CO2e. Facilities may also choose to register if the facility submitted a report under the federal GHGRP and emits between 10,000 and 50,000 tonnes of CO2e. Accordingly, our operations in Tunis and Nipigon are also subject to Ontario’s GHGPE.
​
Under the federal OBPS regulations, the Tunis and Nipigon projects are required to either pay an excess emissions charge or remit compliance units as prescribed by the federal backstop regime for each tonne of CO2e emissions in excess of 370 tonnes of CO2e / GWh of electricity generated by such operations for the 2021 compliance period, and will receive free emissions allowances if the emissions fall below that measure. The emissions limit for both the Nipigon and Tunis facilities will be reduced to 329 tonnes of CO2e / GWh in 2022 under the OBPS.
​
Facilities in Ontario subject to the GHGPE will be required to pay a similar excess emissions charge or remit compliance units per tonne of CO2e emissions, in accordance with the GHG Emissions Performance Standards and Methodology for the Determination of the Total Annual Emissions Limit guideline prepared by the Province. The details of arrangements for the possible recovery of these potential additional costs from the IESO will depend on the terms of the applicable PPA. The Province and federal government’s coordination of the transition between the federal OBPS and the provincial GHGPE also adds to some uncertainty in the future.
​
Renewable Energy
​
More than half of the U.S. states and most Canadian provinces have set mandates requiring the achievement of certain levels of renewable energy production and/or energy efficiency during target timeframes. This includes generation from wind, solar and biomass, and/or renewable fuel mandates. For example, in 2011, California enacted a law requiring retail sellers of electricity to deliver 33% of their customers' electricity requirements from renewable resources, as defined in the statute, by 2020. In 2015, California enacted SB 350, which increases the amount of electricity from renewable resources that California retail sellers must deliver after 2020 to 40% of retail sales by December 2024, 45% of retail sales by December 2027, and 50% of retail sales by December 2030. In order to meet CO2 reduction goals, changes in the generation fuel mix are forecasted to include a reduction in existing coal resources, higher reliance on natural gas and renewable energy resources and an increase in demand-side resources. Investments in new or upgraded transmission lines will be required to move increasing renewable generation from more remote locations to load centers.
​
In December 2015, 195 countries participating in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCC”), at its 21st Conference of the Parties meeting (“COP21”) held in Paris, adopted a new global agreement on the reduction of climate change (the “Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement became effective in November 2016, after it had been ratified by a sufficient number of countries. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to be achieved by aiming to reach a global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. The Paris Agreement consists of two elements: a legally binding commitment by each participating country to set an emissions reduction target, referred to as “nationally determined contributions” or “NDCs,” with a review of the NDCs that could lead to updates and enhancements every five years (Article 4) and a transparency commitment requiring participating countries to disclose in full their progress (Article 13). As decided at the 24th Conference of the Parties meeting in December 2020, countries are expected to submit updated NDCs in 2020. Accordingly, the Paris 

20



Agreement may result in additional regulations to reduce carbon emissions in coming years.
​
Canada ratified the Paris Agreement, and submitted an NDC that included a 2030 target of 30% below 2005 levels. The United States also submitted an NDC, which called for reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. In November 2019, the Trump Administration notified the United Nations of the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which became effective in November 2020. On January 21, 2021, the Biden Administration formally rejoined the Paris Agreement through executive order. The return to the agreement takes effect 30 days from the signing of the executive order. Later in 2021, the Biden Administration is expected to submit a new official commitment that pledges domestic reductions in heat-trapping emissions. In light of the legislative, judicial and executive factors influencing regulatory action, significant uncertainty exists as to how greenhouse gas restrictions in the United States will impact our facilities in the future.
