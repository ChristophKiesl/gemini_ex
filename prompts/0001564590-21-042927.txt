Item 1. Business.
Our Business
 
EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. is a transportation provider serving the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) and other customers. EVO is the second largest surface transportation company serving the USPS with approximately 1,000 vehicles in operation as of December 31, 2019. Of these, approximately 200 vehicles operate on compressed natural gas (“CNG”) which makes us the largest user of alternative fuels amongst transportation companies serving the USPS. In certain markets, we fuel our vehicles at one of our five dedicated CNG stations which serve other customers as well. We operate from our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona and from 15 facilities in 17 states.
 
EVO has grown primarily through acquisitions, and we have completed seven acquisitions since our initial business combination in 2016. We have also grown organically by obtaining new contracts from the USPS and other customers. In 2019, on a pro forma basis, assuming all 2019 acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the year, we generated $217 million in revenues. During 2019, we were awarded 114 additional contracts from the USPS which are expected to generate $15.2 million in annual revenue. We have been actively integrating the acquisitions we have made under common leadership and technology with a goal of operating under a single brand.
 
We are actively engaged in reducing CO2 emissions by converting vehicles to operate on CNG or other alternative fuels and by optimizing the routing efficiency of our operations to reduce fuel usage. During the last year, we replaced 33 diesel tractors with 40 CNG tractors. In 2019, on a pro forma basis, we emitted approximately 85,227 metric tons of CO2 produced while driving approximately 75 million miles, or 0.0011 metric tons per mile. We believe that through operating our CNG vehicles and our sale of approximately 800,000 gas gallon equivalents of fuel to third party customers, we averted 6,565 metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2019.
 
Service and Product Offering
 
Mail Transportation 
 
We transport mail and freight by truck for the USPS and other customers through 315 contracts covering 217,150 average daily route miles in aggregate. We competitively bid on transportation contracts that detail the movement of mail between processing facilities and destination post offices. Customer contracts are typically four years in term and most often are renewed if appropriate service has been performed in accordance with all contract requirements including, but not limited to, USPS performance standards, Service Contract Act requirements, Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulations (federal and state), and all other applicable local and state regulations.
 
As of December 31, 2019, we held 289 contracts with the USPS totaling 193,932 average daily route miles of service. Of these, 277 were traditional route contracts covering 139,822 average daily route miles of pre-set route service, and 12 were Dynamic Route Optimization contracts covering 54,110 average daily route miles.
 
We provide these services through a fleet of 995 tractors and 1,150 drivers as of December 31, 2019. Our mail transportation operations generated $192 million of pro forma revenues in 2019, or 88% of our total pro forma revenues.
 
Local Mail Delivery 
 
We provide outsourced mail delivery to 115 USPS branches in rural markets. We began this business in 2019 as EVO was awarded 112 contracted delivery supplier (“CDS”) contracts by the USPS. We serve local postmasters with 67 vehicles operated by 78 drivers as of December 31, 2019.  Our local mail delivery operations generated $8.1 million of revenues in 2019, or 3.7% of our total revenues.
Freight and Brokerage Services
 
In addition to our USPS mail transportation and delivery services, we provide freight and brokerage services to various corporate customers. In 2019, we transported freight over 8,474,876 miles through these operations.  Our freight and brokerage services generated $29 million of revenues in 2019, or 13.3% of our total revenues.

Compressed Natural Gas Fueling
 
We operate five CNG fueling stations which serve our fleet and other customers. These stations are located in Jurupa Valley, CA; Fort Worth, TX; Oak Creek, WI; Tolleson, AZ; and San Antonio, TX and accommodate class 8 trucks and trailers. Most of our customers fuel at our stations under long term contracts and we have a small number of retail customers.  Our CNG fueling operations generated $1.7 million of revenues in 2019, or just under 1% of our total revenues.
History
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 22, 2010 under the name “Minn Shares Inc.”  From December 2010 until November 2016, Minn Shares Inc. was considered a public “shell” company and dedicated its operations to seeking a potential merger or acquisition partner.  On November 22, 2016, the Company and Titan CNG LLC, a Delaware limited liability company in the business of owning and operating compressed natural gas fueling stations (“Titan”), entered into an agreement and plan of securities exchange whereby the members of Titan acquired approximately 90% of the Company’s outstanding shares. Following the closing, the business plan of Titan became the business plan of the Company and all former officers of the Company resigned and were replaced by officers designated by Titan. On August 31, 2017, the Company changed its name from “Minn Shares Inc.” to “EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc.”
 
Following the November 2016 public shell reverse merger transaction, the Company’s primary strategy was to seek growth through acquisitions.  The Company completed the following acquisitions subsequent to November 2016:

Strategy
 
In 2014, the USPS announced that it intends to drastically reduce their supplier base from over 4,000 surface transportation contractors to less than 1,000 by 2022. As part of this consolidation effort, the USPS began implementing the Dynamic Route Optimization (“DRO”) program and consolidated contracts, which is designed to manage fewer relationships and work with larger prime contractors. As a result, it was estimated that over $1 billion in DRO contracts will come available over the next five years.

We believe EVO is well positioned to take on more business with the USPS as the postal service consolidates vendors. We have a dedicated team focused on bidding on new contracts and responding to any inquiries from the USPS on existing contracts. We believe we have an industry-leading ability to provide the USPS with the information and service levels they desire as we bid on new contracts. As a result, we won two new contracts with the USPS in 2019. We currently have operations which cover 11% of the USPS transportation portfolio and intend to continue to expand our footprint both organically and through acquisitions to provide greater coverage to the USPS.
 
We have invested meaningfully in information systems and personnel which allow us to be effective in managing DRO contracts.  For example, our use of an industry leading transportation management system has allowed us to meet the scheduling and reporting needs of the USPS under its DRO program.  Our acquisitive growth strategy has also enabled us to achieve a greater scale than many of our regional and local competitors, which gives us the ability to competitively bid on a high percentage of available DRO contracts. The Company also intends to compete for awards of long haul and other USPS contracts that become available outside DRO/Consolidation.
 
Our largest customer, the USPS, adopted a robust environmental sustainability plan that includes a stated commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through increased procurement of services from alternative fuels carriers. We have a dedicated focus on reducing emissions through operating routes as efficiently as possible as well as by operating vehicles on CNG. In 2019, we increased our CNG fleet by 85 tractors and now have approximately 15% of our vehicle fleet operating on CNG. In addition, we operate 5 CNG stations which fuel our vehicles and those of other customers. We intend to continue to convert additional vehicles to alternative fuels. We believe our shared commitment with the USPS to reducing emissions positions the Company to grow our business relationship with the USPS in the future. 
 
We intend to leverage our infrastructure to serve additional customers beyond the USPS. By utilizing our technology platform, nationwide network of terminals, and in some cases an ability to offer freight products with similar next day options, we are able to offer transportation services to corporate customers at competitive rates while also improving margins. We will continue to invest in our technology solutions in order to offer industry-leading service to our customers.
 
We also plan to increase utilization of our company owned CNG stations by acquiring trucking companies and developing transit lanes utilizing CNG trucks near our CNG stations. Since January 2019, we completed the acquisition of Sheehy of Waterloo, Wisconsin, which operates the largest fleet of CNG trucks servicing the USPS. We also completed the acquisition of Ursa in 2019, which is based one mile from our Oak Creek CNG station.
 
Market Overview
 
Competition
 
The U.S. mail trucking industry is estimated to represent an approximately $5 billion subset of the broader transportation market. The USPS trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented. In 2014, the USPS had active contracts with over 4,000 transportation contractors, and it has publicly announced that its goal is to reduce that number to below 1,000 by 2022. As a result, the Company estimates that over $1 billion in DRO/Consolidation contracts will come available over the next five years. The Company intends to compete to win new DRO/Consolidation contracts and renew its existing DRO contracts in the future. 
 
The Company competes primarily with other transportation companies for DRO contracts with the USPS. We also compete with other motor carriers for the services of drivers, independent contractors and management employees. Our largest customer, the USPS, typically awards its contracts competitively and often renews contracts with incumbent service providers if appropriate services have been performed. The Company believes that the principal differentiating factors in its business, relative to competition, are service, efficiency, pricing, and its focus on alternative fuels, which aligns with the USPS’s stated preference for contractors who prioritize alternative energy options. Additionally, the Company was an early adopter of the DRO program with the USPS. We believe our existing relationship with the USPS and experience with the DRO program provide the Company an additional competitive advantage when bidding on these contracts.
 
Our Target Customers
 
The USPS is our primary target customer, but we also seek to provide freight trucking and brokerage services to various corporate customers.

Principal Customers and Suppliers
 
The USPS is the Company’s primary customer, and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the USPS accounted for approximately 88% and 95%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue. As a result, the Company’s trucking operations are highly dependent on the USPS. For a discussion of the risks associated with the possible loss of the USPS as a customer or a significant reduction in the Company’s relationship with the USPS, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.
Safety and Risk Management
 
The DOT requires the Company to perform drug and alcohol testing that meets DOT regulations. The Company’s safety program includes pre-employment, random and post-accident drug testing and all other testing required by the DOT. The Company also has equipped approximately 50% of its company tractors with critical-event recorders and plans to equip the remaining 50%. This helps continually train drivers, so that the Company can prevent or reduce the severity of accidents.
 
The primary safety-related risks associated with the Company’s business include physical damage to company equipment, damage to buildings and personal property, third party personal injury and property damage and workers’ compensation. The Company periodically reviews insurance limits and retentions. The Company believes that the insurance it currently maintains provides adequate coverage for its operations.
 
To the extent that the Company subcontracts any portion of its business to third party service providers, those third party service providers operate under their own DOT authority, and provide their own liability insurance and workers compensation insurance which Company has the right to audit from time to time.
 
Fuel
 
In 2019, we used 9,088,278 gallons of diesel and 2,095,691 gas gallon equivalents (“GGEs”) of CNG. Our fuel costs are typically passed on to customers. In 2019 we paid an average of $1.73 per GGE for fuel for our CNG tractors and $2.80 per gallon for our diesel tractors. In addition, we qualify for a retroactive tax credit of $0.50 per GGE for the 2,095,691 GGEs utilized in 2019 and expect this tax credit to continue through 2021.
 
The Company actively manages its fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies and reduce its fuel costs. The Company purchases its fuel through a network of retail truck stops with which it has negotiated volume purchasing discounts. The Company seeks to reduce its fuel costs by routing its drivers to truck stops with which the Company has negotiated volume purchase discounts when fuel prices at such stops are lower than the bulk rate paid for fuel at the Company’s terminals. The Company stores fuel in aboveground and underground storage tanks at some of its facilities.
 
The Company believes the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel-efficient fleet by incorporating fuel efficiency measures and focusing on alternative fuel vehicles, particularly CNG vehicles that can leverage the Company’s current and future CNG fueling stations. The Company may periodically enter into various commodity hedging instruments to mitigate a portion of the effect of fuel price fluctuations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded liabilities related to commodity hedging instruments in the amount of approximately $0 and $11,000, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Shortages of fuel, increases in fuel prices, or rationing of petroleum products could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and profitability.
 
Operations
 
Fleet 
 
We operate a fleet of 824 tractors, 156 straight trucks, and 67 local delivery vehicles of which 815 were owned, 159 were leased and 73 were rented under short term rental agreements as of December 31, 2019. The average age of our owned and leased fleet is 6 years. Of this fleet, 194 of our vehicles operate with CNG. We intend to continue to replace our existing fleet with more efficient diesel, CNG and other alternative fuel vehicles.
Operations Center
 
We manage a centralized operations center in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. At this center we utilize our transaction management system to match inbound USPS route manifests and other load orders with driver schedules and coordinate these activities with our fleet, maintenance, safety, payroll, audit and billing departments.

Technology
 
We utilize an industry leading transportation management system and electronic logging device for scheduling and driver rotations, producing driver hours, route tracking, and billing. This system works in connection with a hardware solution mounted on our trucks. As of December 31, 2019, over 90% of our vehicle fleet had these units installed. In 2019, we began an implementation of NetSuite and Salesforce.com across our company. We expect these systems, once fully utilized, to provide increased operational efficiencies via higher utilization of available truck volume.
Seasonality
 
Due to seasonal increases in USPS volume, the Company’s truck utilization typically increases during the last quarter of each calendar year. At the same time, operating expenses increase, fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling, and harsh weather creates higher accident frequency, increased claims, and higher equipment repair expenditures. Other weather-related or similar events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions can also impact the Company’s operations by disrupting fuel supplies, increasing fuel costs, disrupting freight shipments or routes, affecting regional economies, destroying the Company’s assets or adversely affecting the business or financial condition of customers.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
The Company’s operations are regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local government agencies. The Company and its drivers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT and the agencies within the states that regulate transportation, including those regulations relating to operating authority, safety, drug- and alcohol-testing, hours-of-service, hazardous materials transportation, financial reporting, testing and specification of equipment, and product-handling requirements. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. The Company also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, environmental protection, drivers’ hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, collective bargaining, ergonomics and other matters affecting safety, insurance and operating methods. Other agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate the Company’s equipment, operations, drivers and the environment.
 
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on the Company and its drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service. The FMCSA has adopted a data-driven Compliance, Safety and Accountability (the “CSA”) program as its safety enforcement and compliance model. The CSA program holds motor carries and drivers accountable for their role in safety by evaluating and ranking fleets and individual drivers on certain safety-related standards. To promote improvement in all CSA categories, including those both over and under the established scoring threshold, the Company has procedures in place to address areas where it has exceeded the thresholds and the Company periodically reviews all safety-related policies, programs and procedures for their effectiveness and revises them, as necessary, to establish positive improvement. The Company believes its established policies, programs and procedures are adequate to address any safety-related concerns but can give no assurance these measures will be effective. The FMCSA issues three categories of safety ratings: satisfactory, conditional, and unsatisfactory. The Company currently has a “satisfactory” FMCSA rating on 100% of its fleet. 
 
The FMCSA has also mandated the use of Electronic Logging Devices (“ELDs”) for commercial motor vehicle drivers to measure their compliance with hours-of-service requirements.  Motor carriers and drivers were permitted to use an automatic onboard recording device (“AOBRDs”) compliant with existing regulations in lieu of ELDs if the AOBRDs were put into use prior to December 18, 2017; however, all carriers and drivers subject to FMCSA rules have been required use ELDs since December 16, 2019.
 
The Company is also subject to various labor laws and regulations.  The contracts that the Company holds with USPS are subject to the McNamara-O’Hara Service Contract Act (“SCA”) that is administered by the Department of Labor.  The SCA, among other things, requires that the Company pay its drivers a minimum hourly wage as determined by the DOL as well as provide a bonified fringe benefit package to its drivers.  
 
The Company is also subject to various environmental laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the operation of fuel storage tanks, release of emissions from its vehicles (including engine idling) and facilities, and adverse impacts to the environment, including to the soil, groundwater and surface water. The Company has implemented programs designed to monitor and address identified environmental risks.  Historically, the Company’s environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations.
 
5



The Company’s operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage into the environment, discharge of contaminants, environmental damage, and unauthorized hazardous material spills, releases or disposal actions, among others. If the Company is found to be responsible for such contamination or spills, the Company could be subject to costs and liabilities, including costs for remediation, environmental natural resource damages and penalties.
 
Federal and state lawmakers have implemented or proposed potential limits on greenhouse gas emissions under a variety of climate-change initiatives. The EPA regulations limiting exhaust emissions have increasingly become more restrictive in recent years, and the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) have also developed stricter fuel-efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks. New trailers are subject to greenhouse gas emission limits and fuel efficiency standards. Some states and municipalities have also begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. While impossible to predict, the Company expects that these existing and new regulations will result in increased costs for acquiring new tractors and for additional parts and maintenance activities to retrofit its tractors with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, particularly if such costs are not offset by any potential fuel savings. These regulations create uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual value of these vehicles. New idling restrictions could force the Company to alter its drivers’ behavior, purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle, or face a decrease in productivity. While we anticipate changing emission-control and fuel-efficiency standards to result in increased costs, the Company cannot predict the extent to which these regulations will impact its operations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately 1,503 employees, consisting of 1,094 full-time employees and 409 part-time employees. The Company employed 1,228 drivers as of December 31, 2019. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
