Our principal executive office is located at 12600 Deerfield Parkway, Suite 100, Alpharetta, GA 30004, our corporate offices are located at 9710 Scranton Road, Suite 200, San Diego, CA 92121 and our sales and engineering offices are located throughout the world. Inseego’s common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol “INSG”.
Overview
Inseego Corp. is a leader in the design and development of fixed and mobile wireless solutions (advanced 4G and 5G NR), IIoT and cloud solutions for Fortune 500 enterprises, service providers, small and medium-sized businesses, governments, and consumers around the globe. Our product portfolio consists of fixed and mobile device-to-cloud solutions that provide compelling, intelligent, reliable and secure end-to-end IoT services with deep business intelligence. Inseego’s products and solutions, designed and developed in the U.S., power mission critical applications with a “zero unscheduled downtime” mandate, such as our 5G fixed wireless access (“FWA”) gateway solutions, 4G and 5G mobile broadband, IIoT applications such as SD WAN failover management, asset tracking and fleet management services. Our solutions are powered by our key wireless innovations in mobile and FWA technologies, including a suite of products employing the 5G NR standards, and purpose-built SaaS cloud platforms.
We have been at the forefront of the ways in which the world stays connected and accesses information, and protects, and derives intelligence from that information. With multiple first-to-market innovations across a number of wireless technologies, including 5G, and a strong and growing portfolio of hardware and software innovations for IIoT solutions, Inseego has been advancing technology and driving industry transformations for over 30 years. It is this proven expertise, commitment to quality, obsession with innovation and a relentless focus on execution that makes us a preferred global partner of service providers, distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, and enterprises worldwide.
Industry Trends
For over two decades, the mobile industry has experienced tremendous advancements and growth. As the largest technology platform in the world, mobile connectivity has changed the way we work, the way we live and the way we connect with each other. The scale and pace of innovation in mobile technology, especially around connectivity and computing capabilities, is also impacting industries beyond traditional wireless.
Looking forward, Inseego is working with leading global service providers and enterprises in the mobile and FWA ecosystems to further develop, commercialize and accelerate the availability of 5G NR based solutions, which represents the next generation of mobile technology. 5G has been coined “the 4th industrial revolution” due to the richness of use cases targeted, and refers to 5G NR, which is the standard adopted by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (“3GPP”), an international consortium responsible for the development of mobile standards. 5G has been designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, sub-millisecond network latency and wider spectrum bandwidths. Incorporating many of the innovations developed for 4G LTE, 5G is also expected to be scalable and adaptable across a variety of use cases, which include, among others, empowering new industries and services, such as autonomous vehicles, telemedicine, live ultra-high definition video streaming, cloud gaming, edge computing, and countless industrial applications such as augmented reality and robotics for smart manufacturing. According to coverage maps posted on each carrier’s website, as of February 2021, Verizon Wireless’ commercial 5G network was live in 57 cities, including San Diego, AT&T’s reached 179 million people and T-Mobile/Sprint’s reached 280 million people. 
The widespread adoption of IoT in enterprise applications, including the manufacturing, agriculture, industrial automation, retail and healthcare industry sectors, among others, along with an increasing dependence on smartphone applications and always-connected computers, and the constraints of 4G LTE technology are prompting mobile network operators to embark on an accelerated rollout of 5G communications to keep pace with expected network demands. As the fifth-generation wireless broadband technology, 5G NR is based on the 3GPP Release 15 standard. The key operating ranges for 5G spectrum globally are in the sub-6 GHz (below 6 GHz), and millimeter wave (28 GHz and 39 GHz bands), with speed offerings greater than 1 Gigabit (“Gb”) per second and sub-millisecond latency, providing better coverage and signaling efficiency. Networks utilizing 5G technology are expected to deploy meaningfully in 2020 and beyond.
The growing demand for high speed data, increased demand for machine-to-machine communications and low latency requirements for new applications are key factors contributing to the growth of the 5G. 4G LTE is expected to continue to operate alongside 5G as a major part of the wireless ecosystem. Based on industry reports, such as GSMA Intelligence’s report on The 5G era in the US, we believe that 4G and 5G networks will coexist and remain complementary for many years. This means that operators will be able to service a significant share of the data traffic on 4G networks, leaving 5G with the dual 
remit of absorbing overflow capacity and underpinning consumer and enterprise services that require higher speeds and/or lower latency. As such, most 5G devices are expected to include multimode support for 4G and Wi-Fi, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed and simultaneous connectivity across 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, while also allowing mobile operators to utilize current network deployments. At the same time, 4G is expected to continue to evolve in parallel with the development of 5G and become fundamental to many of the key 5G technologies, such as support for unlicensed spectrum, gigabit LTE user data rates (currently available from Inseego) and cellular IoT with connectivity designed to meet the needs of ultra-low power and low cost applications. 
Further, based on GSMA Intelligence’s November 2020 paper titled Internet of Things in the 5G Era, we expect that the number of IoT connections could grow to 25.2 billion by 2025. As of September 30, 2020, there were approximately 6.2 billion 4G connections globally, representing 78% of total mobile connections (GSMA Intelligence, November 2020). By 2024, global 4G connections are projected to reach 6.5 billion, with approximately 89% of these connections in emerging regions and China (GSMA Intelligence, November 2020). Meanwhile, 5G is gaining pace and by 2025, 5G is expected to account for 20% of global connections, with take-up particularly strong across Asia, North America, and Europe. Based on reports such as those by GSMA Intelligence, we believe that 5G will bring a number of enhanced benefits not available using 4G networks including massive numbers of both fixed and mobile wireless devices with differing speed, bandwidth and quality of service demands, allowing the networks to provide support for “massive numbers of IoT devices and wireless edge technologies” for use cases including manufacturing, augmented and virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles. 
As a core member of the 5G ecosystem, we continue to work closely with wireless operators, chipset suppliers and infrastructure vendors around the world on 5G developments and trials in preparation for commercial network launches. We are currently working with 11 wireless carriers globally and are involved in 21 5G trials, which could provide access to over 600 million wireless subscribers. Beyond 2020, over 50 wireless operators are contemplating commercial 5G network launches—potentially providing 5G access to over 2 billion wireless subscribers. According to Ericsson’s Mobility Report November 2019 Edition, this migration to 5G is roughly twice as fast as that of previous wireless generations, and we are increasingly diversifying our business as this 5G opportunity comes into realization and our addressable market expands. 
The adoption of IoT technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging cellular IoT technologies to increase efficiency, gain better customer insights, facilitate compliance and build new business models. IoT growth is expanding broadly, and adoption is particularly strong in the telematics and transportation industries and in industrial IoT markets such as smart city infrastructure, utilities and energy management. We are building IoT capabilities by leveraging business models that monetize usage on most major carrier networks. We have developed IoT solutions that address key market needs for asset tracking applications, telematics, SD WAN failover management, retail, remote monitoring and various other industrial automation applications. In addition, our cloud solutions can turn the data that our solutions provide into actionable insights for our customers so they can develop new services and create revenue growth.
Since January 1, 2020, demand has significantly increased for products and services in our industry, driven by an increase in the number of professionals globally that are working from home. We are continually looking for ways to capitalize on this increased demand.

At December 31, 2020, we had 1,015 employees of which 998 were full-time employees. We also use the services of consultants and temporary workers from time to time. With the exception of a small number of our employees in South Africa, our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Human Capital Resources
Our Culture: Culture is critically important to our growth and performance. We are driven by our values of Accountability, Sense of Urgency, Market Driven Innovation, Customer Focus, and Integrity. We are committed to creating a world class employee experience through leadership development, career planning, open two-way communications, total compensation, and positive work environment. 
In our latest engagement survey, our employees answered favorably to questions on Work Environment & Communications where the average score was over 91%.
Diversity & Inclusion: Our Come Together initiative was launched in 2020. Come Together gives employees the opportunity to participate in workstreams whose goals are to create a culture of belonging. Each workstream is led by employee volunteers with a passion for diversity and inclusion and reach beyond Inseego team members. The different workstreams are: Community Engagement, Employee Development, Recruiting, Women in Technology, and Affinity Groups. The foundation has been set in 2020 to accelerate important work in this area in 2021 and beyond.
Talent: We believe that Talent is key to our success. It starts with finding and placing the right Talent for the right jobs at the right time. We communicate our value proposition in a clear and concise manner. The expected growth in the 5G Market creates a unique opportunity for candidates and employees of Inseego to have a career at the forefront of a dynamic industry. Our company size and culture allows employees to build and expand their skill set in ways that will enrich their careers. In 2020, we initiated Talent Reviews with Senior Leaders to holistically evaluate the talent across the company. This will enable the company to focus on accelerating development for those who are top performers and strengthen the talent pipeline.
Work Life Harmony: We believe that it is important to provide Work Life Harmony and its practices can vary globally. In the US, employees have Friday ‘summer hours’ where two hours in the afternoon are blocked from meetings to ensure that there is “work” and “think” time. This time can be used to catch up on tasks, conduct a review of the past week, and plan for the following week. During 2020, the Company launched an Unlimited Paid Time Off program for exempt employees in the U.S. This program gives team members the flexibility to take time off that makes sense for them and frees employees from the confines of traditional accrued time off policies. 
In 2020, Inseego also launched the Health & Wellness Initiative in the U.S. to help employees find ways to create more balance in their lives. As part of this initiative, all employees were given a complimentary Calm App membership that includes useful resources designed to strengthen mental fitness and provide tools to tackle stress. 
Data & Insights: In 2020 Inseego consolidated multiple human resource systems to a common platform. This will allow the Company to deliver real time employee self-service and data and insights to management. The migration to one platform will enable the human resources team to obtain valuable employee insights and enact changes more quickly.
