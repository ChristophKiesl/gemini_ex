ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. (the "registrant" or "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota in November 1990 under the name Fonahome Corporation. On March 24, 2009, the Company reincorporated in the state of Nevada and merged with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fona, Inc., adopting the surviving companys name, Fona, Inc. The Company was originally formed to develop and market an interactive information and advertising service.

From December 1999 through October 2015, the Company had no significant business operations. On March 3, 2009, the Company held a shareholder meeting approving the Stock Purchase Agreement and an Agreement and Plan of Merger effectively changing the name of the Company to Fona Inc., a Nevada corporation (Re-incorporation Merger) and simultaneously adopting the capital structure of Fona Inc., which includes total authorized capital stock of 800,000,000 shares, of which 780,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are blank check preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series with such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolutions adopted by the Corporations Board providing for the issuance of such preferred stock or series thereof. On March 24, 2009, the Articles of Merger of Fonahome Corporation, a Minnesota Corporation, into Fona, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State.

On June 6, 2014, Evolutionary Genomics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (EG), EG I, LLC (EG I) and Fona, Inc., a Nevada corporation (Fona), Fona Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Sub) and Fona Merger Sub, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (Sub LLC), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger as amended by the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 2, 2015 (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which, on October 19, 2015 Sub merged with EG and Sub LLC merged with EG I, with each EG and EG I surviving as wholly owned subsidiaries of Fona. For accounting purposes, the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition with Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. as the acquirer and Fona as the acquired party. Subsequent to the Merger, Fona, Inc. was renamed Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. and our subsidiary was renamed from Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. to EG Crop Science, Inc. On May 9, 2016, we formed ICAM Therapeutics, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) as a wholly owned subsidiary of Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. We have not incurred any transactions in this company nor have we established any business plan for the future.

The Company maintains headquarters at the office of its Chief Executive Officer. The Company maintains a website at www.evolgen.com. The Company is not required to deliver an annual report to security holders and at this time does not anticipate the distribution of such a report. The Company will file reports with the SEC.

GENERAL BUSINESS PLAN

On August 14, 2000, the Company was issued patent number 6274319, titled Methods to identify evolutionarily significant changes in polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences in domestic plants and animals. On June 1, 2004, the Company was issued patent number 6743580, titled Methods for producing transgenic plants containing evolutionarily significant polynucleotides. These patents are for the core Adapted Traits Platform that we use for the discovery of genes in humans, animals and commercial crops. The Company has applied the Adapted Traits Platform in research projects including identifying genes believed to be responsible for increases in yield in corn, increases in yield in rice, salt tolerance and sugar content in tomatoes and pest/disease resistance in soybeans, bananas and multiple other crops. 
EG Technology  The Adapted Traits Platform (ATP)

Genomics research generates vast amounts of sequence data for thousands of genes. Some companies use this sequence data to try to predict the function of each gene and its potential to impact key traits. Others try to match the thousands of random deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) changes between individuals with differences in traits. Evolutionary Genomics approach is to first narrow the search to genes that have undergone adaptive evolution (positively selected genes) in an organism that has an adapted trait of potential commercial value. To identify genes with impact on commercially desirable traits, Evolutionary Genomics screens first for positively selected genes. Evolutionary Genomics then focuses functional genomics efforts on demonstrating the effects of these genes on the desired traits.

Evolutionary Genomics uses the Adapted Traits Platform to perform high throughput molecular evolution analysis to identify positively selected genes based on Ka/Ks analysis (as defined below). Ka/Ks analysis was developed to document the role of positive selection on known protein coding genes. Molecular-level adaptive evolution is indicated when comparisons of homologous protein coding sequences from closely related species show that the number of amino acid differences fixed due to selection exceeds what can be expected by neutral evolution. Molecular-level positive selection can be detected in protein-coding genes by pairwise comparisons of the ratios of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks). The algorithm, by comparing substitutions per site, takes into account, in rigorous fashion, the effect of bias and degeneracy in the genetic code, and also compensates for the effects of multiple hits at the same site. Ka/Ks ratios significantly greater than unity strongly suggest that positive selection has fixed greater numbers of amino acid replacements than can be expected as a result of chance alone. 

Dr. Walter Messier, a Company founder and our Chief Technology Officer, published a seminal paper in the field: Messier and Stewart (1997) Episodic adaptive evolution of primate lysozymes Nature 385:151-154. The work described in this publication demonstrated that a known lysozyme gene that had been recruited for a new function to aid in digestion of leaves as a food source in certain monkeys had the kind of adaptive genetic changes indicating that the lysozyme gene had evolved more rapidly than the neutral substitution rate, indicating Darwinian positive selection. Many groups have used such methods to document Darwinian positive selection in other proteins. It was Dr. Messiers insight that genes controlling a trait of interest could be identified by using molecular evolution analysis as a screen, comparing genes in a species with a trait to genes of a closely related species lacking the trait. The adapted genes found in such a screen could then be validated to determine their role in the presence or absence of the trait of interest. 

Agricultural Industry

In the past century, agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity, the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, selective breeding, mechanization, water contamination, and farm subsidies. Proponents of organic farming such as Sir Albert Howard argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long-term fertility of the soil. While this feeling lay dormant for decades, as environmental awareness has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards sustainable agriculture by some farmers, consumers, and policymakers.

Advances in genetic research and modification of crop species have led to increased yield, drought tolerance and disease/pest resistance. These advances have also led to an increased concentration within the providers of seed to the industry. The top seed companies control much of the implementation of new seed varieties through patents and licensing agreements. Genetic traits providers, like Evolutionary Genomics, identify and develop genes that impact traits of interest to the industry and market those genes to these seed companies.

Business Model

Evolutionary Genomics primary source of revenue to date has been contract services revenue for research performed by Evolutionary Genomics on behalf of other commercial entities and grant income received from governmental agencies, industry associations and grant making foundations for research performed. Ownership of the intellectual property developed can vary from Evolutionary Genomics retaining all intellectual property rights to retaining none of the developed intellectual property for the crop that is the subject of the project. In addition to the revenue resulting from contract services and grants, Evolutionary Genomics has entered into licensing agreements for the commercial use of intellectual property that we have developed. Licensing revenue can be lump sum payments, milestone payments upon achievement of defined goals and/or percentages of revenue for products sold by licensee. These payments are often many years after completion of gene identification project as licensees engage in significant additional testing including field trials prior to integration into licensee commercial germplasm lines. There can be no guarantee that these licensing agreements will result in any additional revenue for Evolutionary Genomics as further development of licensed intellectual property is mostly controlled by the licensee. 

Evolutionary Genomics soybean pest resistance project is an illustration of the evolution of a project from concept through marketing to seed companies. The project has yielded identified genes for pest resistance in soybeans with partial validation complete and full validation results expected in mid-2020. Evolutionary Genomics has had discussions with seed companies to commercialize the genes and intends to continue those discussions in 2020 with two generation, whole plant validation results. The Company has extended this pest resistance research to other crops including bananas, beans, tomatoes, cotton and maize.

On August 6, 2015, the Company was awarded an Advanced Industries Accelerator Grant by the State of Colorado in the amount of $250,000 to fund further research in the development of pest resistance genes in soybeans and other crops and sweetness genes in tomatoes. Through December 31, 2017, the Company recognized all of the revenue from the contract. On June 26, 2018, the Company was awarded an Advanced Industries Accelerator Grant by the State of Colorado in the amount of $250,000 to identify and validate pathogen resistance genes in bananas and complete validation and marketing tomato and corn genes. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has recognized $237,500 of the revenue from the contract. The Company maintains ownership of all intellectual property developed from the use of grant funds.

During 2013 and 2014 EG performed research on two projects for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. On November 1, 2012 Evolutionary Genomics entered into a Master Services Agreement and Work Order #1 under that agreement with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the validation of EG 261 orthologs in beans and cowpeas. That validation work was completed in 2016. The market for beans and cowpeas is considerably smaller than for soybeans and we do not intend to market them to the seed companies for commercialization. Evolutionary Genomics has recognized the full $762,000 it is entitled to under that work order. 

Evolutionary Genomics intends to continue to pursue grant funding from governmental agencies, industry associations and grant making foundations. These sources of funding are often subject to limitations in available funds, funding priorities in areas other than our area of focus, political uncertainties, long approval processes and competition with other research proposals. If such funding is not available, Evolutionary Genomics may incur the costs of these projects with the prospect of revenue uncertain and likely many years in the future.

Evolutionary Genomics Business Strategy

On April 29, 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patent 8,710,300 titled EXPRESSION OF DIRIGENT GENE EG261 AND ITS ORTHOLOGS AND PARALOGS ENHANCES PATHOGEN RESISTANCE IN PLANTS. On December 5, 2017, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patent 9,834,783 which extended the previous patent to include additional variations of the gene. During 2017, the Company was issued similar patents in Canada, Brazil and China and has additional patents pending in Argentina and India. On January 11, 2019, the Company filed a patent application on its second soybean pest/disease resistance gene, EG19 and has included that gene in its ongoing two generation, whole plant validation research with the University of Missouri and with the Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center. The Company has also discovered additional candidate genes that may impact pathogen resistance. There can be no assurance that any of these genes will be proven effective in validation testing or lead to licensing agreements or revenue.

The single most valuable step in the process of crop improvement is the identification of the key genes among the 30,000 in the genome that has the desired impact. EG set out to find genes in soybeans that impact pest and disease resistance. We identified two that showed promise and, in hairy root assays on one of these genes, EG261, at the University of Wisconsin  Madison, proved that EG261 impacted resistance. When we discussed these results with the larger seed companies, they indicated interest but wanted to see two generation, whole plant testing results before entering licensing negotiations. We have engaged the University of Missouri and the Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center to independently perform these validation studies for us. 

As a small company restricted by our limited resources, we cannot afford to generate vast numbers of events. Moderate success is important enough to indicate that further optimization can lead to significantly improved results. We must prove that there is enough evidence to warrant additional trials by companies with vastly more resources to build on our success but the single most valuable step in this process is the identification of the gene that has the desired impact and we have identified two of these genes, EG261 and EG19.

With transgenic change to plants, we use multiple tools to try to land the gene in the right spot in the genome but it is still an imperfect artform. We need to generate enough events in which the gene lands in the right place and is then inherited into the next generation with the right expression level. A low percentage of all attempts result in a testable event and, even then, you cannot be sure that the gene falls into the perfect spot or is expressed at the optimal level. We must generate enough events so that we have a few that genuinely show the impact of the gene. False negatives are the rule and we cannot be discouraged by them. A small number of successes can greatly outweigh a large number of false negatives.

Over the last four years, the lab at the University of Missouri has been attempting to create transgenic events with eleven constructs of EG261 and EG19 along with controls which are tested to confirm that the gene landed in the genome and was inherited into the next generation. Heritable events are then grown to seed and the seeds are tested to see if they are homozygous and are tested to see how many copies of the gene are inherited. The seeds from these homozygous plants are the T2 generation that is tested for resistance impact. Promising T2 lines are grown to see to generate T3 plants for further resistance testing. When enough data is accumulated, we will present our results to seed companies.

On December 3, 2014, Evolutionary Genomics entered into a Fee for Service Agreement with The Curators of the University of Missouri for the development of transgenic soybean plants with candidate genes for SCN resistance with total contract payments, including amendments, totaling $357,310 of which $214,386 has been paid through December 31, 2019. On May 2, 2018, the Company notified the University of Missouri that the performance under this contract did not appear to meet certain guaranteed minimum requirements. On January 22, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment with the University of Missouri reducing the contract amount to $214,386 all of which has been paid as of December 31, 2019. 

A critical element of the research with the University of Missouri was to generate a large enough number of heritable single copy events to facilitate the next stage of resistance testing with Dr. Nguyens lab at the University of Missouri. There have been a small number of events indicating of the impact of both EG261 and EG19 but not nearly enough events were produced to create robust data sets. We continue to process the small number of viable events at the University of Missouri to test for SCN resistance and results are expected in 2020. 

It is critical to note that the soybean transformation project difficulties at the University of Missouri do not reflect on the efficacy of our genes but, instead, are a reflection of their process not creating enough transgenic events.

We needed to generate additional viable events at another institution and entered into a Service Agreement with Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center (WCIC) under which they have transformed soybeans using our genes. WCIC guarantees a minimum number of successful events, have helped to establish the right combinations to achieve a range of expression and will test to assure us of successful events. WCIC currently has events from seven constructs of EG261 and EG19 growing in their greenhouses. These plants will be harvested in May 2020 for generation T2 seeds. The T2 generation seedlings will be tested for SCN resistance in June 2020. If these tests are positive, it is our intention to market the genes to the industry in mid-2020.

If results from the whole plant validation trials confirm the findings of the University of Wisconsin-Madison for EG261 and the effectiveness of the new genes, the Company will enter negotiations for a long-term research collaboration and licensing agreement with seed companies. If these negotiations are successful, this type of agreement will likely have an upfront payment, milestone payments during their testing and a licensing royalty stream once the genes are incorporated into commercial seed lines. The testing phase includes field trials which may proceed for several years prior to generating licensing revenue. There are many risks in this process including some that are outside of Evolutionary Genomics control and there can be no guarantee that we will ever generate any revenue from these potential agreements. If Evolutionary Genomics receives product royalties from the soybean genes, it is required to pay the United Soybean Board a ten percent royalty stream not to exceed 150% of the grant amount of $262,476.

The Company has identified pest/disease resistance genes in other commercially valuable crops. The Company is in various stages of projects identifying genes in tomatoes and corn that may lead to increased pest/disease resistance. If successful, we intend to market them to the seed industry. 
This strategy will require Evolutionary Genomics to incur significant research costs prior to any confirmation of commercial viability and there can be no guarantee that the desired results can be achieved or that commercialization can be reached. 

Evolutionary Genomics has identified a gene in tomatoes that impacts the plants ability to tolerate salt and a gene that appears to control sweetness. On January 9, 2018, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patent 9,862,962 titled IDENTIFICATION AND USE OF TOMATO GENES CONTROLLING SALT/DROUGHT TOLERANCE AND FRUIT SWEETNESS. Despite discussions with seed companies, the Company has not been able to reach any agreement to license these genes and there can be no assurance that we will ever realize any revenue from these genes.

In 2014, the Company began a project to identify genes in cotton that may impact traits of commercial interest. In particular, we intend to focus on pest resistance and fiber length. We have used our Adapted Traits Platform to identify positively selected candidate genes and intend to further research these genes to confirm that they were positively selected. If any of these genes remain promising, we intend to contract with an independent lab to validate the effectiveness of those genes. These studies can be very costly and there can be no assurance that we will be successful with this project.

During the 1950s the global banana industry was devastated by a disease (caused by Fusarium fungus) that effectively wiped out the predominate variety of commercial bananas know as Gros Michel leading to the development of the Cavendish banana, which makes up well over 90% of the commercial banana market today. Cavendish was resistant to the strain of Fusarium that wiped out the Gros Michel variety but, in recent years, is being challenged by a new race of Fusarium that threatens to once again devastate the global banana industry. This crisis is imminent and has no solution. The recent emergence of Panama Disease TR4 in the Western Hemisphere makes a swift solution to the crisis even more urgent. A substantial part of the banana market consists of exports from Central and South America to the United States. This market is now critically imperiled.

In 2018, the Company began a project to identify genes in wild banana relatives that are resistant to Fusarium. We believe that we are uniquely qualified to provide a solution to this crisis. We have previously used our technology to identify genes in common beans and, in our project for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in common beans, proved that these genes provided increased resistance to Fusarium fungus. We used our platform to isolate a banana gene that controls Fusarium Wilt, aka Panama Disease, Tropical Race 4. The gene, which we have named FusR1 (Fusarium Resistance 1), is a native gene in Musa species, including cultivated bananas. We have found that, for all FW-resistant banana cultivars/species that we have tested, one version of our gene exists while, in all FW-sensitive banana cultivars/species that we have tested, there is a different version of FusR1. And notably, a third version exists in semi-resistant varieties that has allowed us to identify the particular nucleotide changes that are crucial for resistance to Fusarium Wilt. 

We believe that this native banana gene can be introduced into cultivated bananas, particularly the Fusarium-sensitive Cavendish cultivar, in order to make these cultivars resistant to Fusarium Wilt. Cavendish cultivars are sterile and seedless, but it should be possible to use MAB (marker assisted breeding), though perhaps difficult and time-consuming, to move FusR1 into Cavendish and other cultivated bananas. We believe that a gene transformation approach would be faster and easier. Given the threat of possible extinction for Cavendish, rapid approaches are not only warranted but essential and minimally genetically edited bananas will be accepted depending upon how the gene transfer is accomplished. Transfer of this native banana gene to cultivated bananas can be best accomplished with CRISPR technology, which allows a targeted, clean, and efficient transfer and which, as compared to more traditional genetic editing techniques, minimizes potential side effects. In fact, we believe that Cavendish bananas can be rendered Fusarium Wilt resistant by changing only a few base pairs. These sorts of minimal changes have been allowed by the USDA and FDA in several crops. Even in Europe, use of CRISPR technology has gained substantial traction.

On June 26, 2019, we filed a United States patent application titled IDENTIFICATION AND RESISTANCE GENES FROM WILD RELATIVES OF BANANA AND THEIR USES IN CONTROLLING PANAMA DISEASE. We have also entered into discussions with the largest banana companies in the world. Based on previous experience and common practice in the agriculture industry, we believe that potential agreements with these companies may include some combination of upfront payments for research completed to date, partial or full funding of validation trials, lumpsum milestone payments and/or long term royalty payments upon their use of our gene in production. The Company is engaged in advanced discussions with one of these banana companies regarding a relationship to further develop our banana genes through transformation and validation. We expect to incur significant expenses for the transformation and validation of our banana genes over the next twenty-four months which we expect to be funded by this agreement. There can be no assurance that we will reach such an agreement or that the funding will be available.

If we are able to successfully transform and validate our banana genes, which will likely take approximately twenty-four months, we hope to enter into a long term royalty contract with one or more banana producers based on banana revenue, banana plants produced or acres planted with plants with our gene. There are many risks associated with achieving these desired results including but not limited to:

-We may not reach agreement with any of the banana companies for funding of the transformation/validation;
 -We may not be able to adequately establish patent protection for our intellectual property or others may have competing claims;
 -Others may develop competitive approaches to compete with our genes;
 -Our transformation academic labs may fail to develop enough events for testing;
 -Our genes may cause unforeseen and undesirable changes beyond the pest resistance such as yield degradation;
 -Our genes may fail to deliver the desired results of resistance to Fusarium;
 -Globally regulations and/or consumer preference may prevent the successful commercial launch of bananas with genetics changed using our methods; and
 -We will be dependent on other companies for the successful production and marketing of bananas with our genes and many factors will be outside of our control.

Competition

Evolutionary Genomics competition is very broad from the largest seed companies like Monsanto Company, Syngenta AG, Bayer Crop Science, Dupont Pioneer and Dow and others to the smallest grower who is successful in breeding new, improved varieties. These same competitors are also Evolutionary Genomics customers as Evolutionary Genomics seeks to license intellectual property for commercialization into their seed lines. Many of these companies are exponentially larger with many more resources at their disposal and there can be no assurance that EG can continue to compete with them or interest them in licensing our intellectual property.
