ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” “our” and refer to PHP Ventures Acquisition Corp.
 
Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on April 13, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all the risks associated with emerging growth companies.
 
Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Choo Yeow Ngoh, who brings 15 years of experience in the business and entrepreneurship world building great consumer products and companies. Mr. Ngoh has experience dealing directly with relevant authorities, governments, and bureaucracies to ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and standards. He has worked with numerous governments during the course of his career as an entrepreneur. He is familiar with many aspects of opening a foreign business in a new country, including obtaining government approvals for investment, work permits and other visa issues and obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of products.
 
The Company’s sponsor is Global Link Investment LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on August 11, 2021. On August 16, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 5,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000 (see Note 6) (the “Initial Public Offering”). The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any.

Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 270,900 units (the “Placement Units”) to the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $2,709,000 (the “Private Placement”).
 
Subsequently, on August 19, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the “Over-allotment Option Units”). The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 750,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $7,500,000. On August 19, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-allotment Option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 22,500 Placement Units, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. The Placement Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
 
A total of $58,075,000, comprised of the proceeds from the Offering and the proceeds of private placements that closed on August 16, 2021, and August 19, 2021, net of the underwriting commissions, discounts, and offering expenses, was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.
 
The holders of the Units (comprising shares of the Class A Common Stock, Rights and Warrants) were able to separately trade the shares of Class A Common Stock, Rights and Warrants commencing on October 4, 2021.
 
On August 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had caused to be deposited $575,000 into the Company’s Trust account for its public stockholders, representing $0.10 per public share, allowing the Company to extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial business combination by three months from August 16, 2022 to November 16, 2022, which extension was the first of two three-month extensions permitted under the Company’s governing documents at the time.
 
On November 3, 2022, the Company filed its quarterly report for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022, on Form 10-Q.
 
On November 7, 2022, the Company announced that it had caused to be deposited $575,000 into the Company’s Trust account for its public stockholders, representing $0.10 per public share, allowing the Company to once again extend the period of time it had to consummate its initial business combination by three months from November 16, 2022 to February 16, 2023, which extension was the second of two three-month extensions permitted under the Company’s governing documents at the time.
 
On December 5, 2022, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A calling for a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders for the sole purpose of voting upon three proposals (i) the Extension Amendment Proposal, (ii) the Trust Amendment Proposal, and, if necessary, (iii) the Adjournment Proposal, which proposals were more fully described in the Proxy Statement on file with the SEC and which, if approved, would allow the Company additional time to complete its business combination (the “Business Combination”) and extend the Termination Date to the Extended Deadline.

On December 15, 2022, the Company filed the definite proxy statement on Schedule 14A calling for a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders to be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on December 28, 2022, at https://www.cstproxy.com/phpventuresacquisition/2022, for the sole purpose of voting upon the following three proposals, as stated on the Form Schedule 14A:
 
● a proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Existing Company Charter”) in the form set forth in Annex A to the accompanying Proxy Statement, which we refer to as the “Extension Amendment,” giving the Company the right to extend the date by which the Company must (i) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses (a “business combination”), (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase 100% of the Company’s Class A common stock included as part of the units sold in the Company’s Initial Public Offering that closed on August 16, 2021 (the “IPO”) from February 16, 2023 (the “Termination Date”) by up to six (6) one-month extensions to August 16, 2023 at a price of $0.0525 per share per month, commencing February 16, 2023, our current Termination Date (which we refer to as the “Extension,” and such later date, the “Extended Deadline”) (such proposal is the “Extension Amendment Proposal”). For the purposes of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), the full text of the resolution is as follows: “RESOLVED, that subject to and conditional upon the trust account, which is governed by the Investment Management Trust Agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on August 16, 2021, having net tangible assets of at least US $5,000,001 as at the date of this resolution, the amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, a copy of which is attached to the accompanying proxy statement as Annex A, be and is hereby adopted.”
 
● a proposal to amend the Investment Management Trust Agreement dated August 16, 2021 (the “Trust Agreement”) entered into between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee (“Continental”) and the Company governing the trust account (the “Trust Account”) established in connection with the IPO (the “Trust Amendment”), pursuant to the Amended Investment Management Trust Agreement in the form set forth in Annex B to the accompanying Proxy Statement to extend the date on which Continental must liquidate the Trust Account if the Company has not completed its initial business combination, from February 16, 2023 to August 16, 2023 (or such later date as may be determined by the Company’s stockholders) (such proposal is the “Trust Amendment Proposal”), and
 
● a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal, which we refer to as the “Adjournment Proposal,” which will be presented only if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal.  
 
Each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, Trust Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is more fully described in the Proxy Statement on file with the SEC. The purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal, and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal, is to allow us additional time to complete our business combination (the “Business Combination”) and extend the Termination Date to the Extended Deadline.
 
On December 28, 2022, the Company announced that it had received redemption notices for 4,464,250 shares of its Class A Common Stock from its stockholders. Accordingly, the Company postponed the previously scheduled meeting until 2:00 p.m. on Friday, December 30, 2022, to solicit investors to reverse their redemption notices. Assuming no more than the minimum shares necessary to meet the condition of the Extension Proposal are received, each non-redeeming stockholder would receive an additional $0.0625 per month per share for the duration of the Extension going forward.
 
In response, and in connection, therewith the Company revised the terms of the previously announced proposed amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”) to be considered by its stockholders at a Special Meeting of Stockholders to be held December 30, 2022 (the “Special Meeting”) along with a proposed amendment to the investment management trust agreement (the “Trust Agreement”) between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee (“Continental”), and the Company governing the trust account (the “Trust Account”) established in connection with the Company’s Initial Public Offering dated August 16, 2021 (the “Trust Amendment”). As revised, the Extension Amendment would amend the Charter to provide for up to six one-month extensions to the date by which the Company must complete its initial business combination (the “Extended Date”), at the Company’s option, provided that the Company deposits into the Trust Account an additional $0.010 per unit for each month extended.

On December 30, 2022, at 2:00 p.m., Eastern time, the special meeting of the Company’s Stockholders was held virtually at https://www.cstproxy.com/phpventuresacquisition/2022, pursuant to due notice.
 
At the Special Meeting, the Solicitor of the Election: 1) examined the proxy tabulation report containing a record of proxies presented, and found that out of 7,480,900 shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, each of which entitles the holder to one vote per share, the holders of 6,527,307 shares were present at the virtual meeting or by proxy, representing 87.25% of the shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting; and 2) took a vote among the holders of common stock of the Company on the Extension Amendment Proposal No. 1, and the Trust Amendment Proposal No. 2. The Extension Amendment Proposal No. 1 received 6,527,288 votes in favor, and the Trust Amendment Proposal No. 2 received 6,527,307 votes in favor.
 
Proposed Transaction
 
On December 8, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among (i) Modulex Modular Buildings Plc, a company registered in England and Wales with company number 07291662 (“Modulex”), (ii) Modulex Merger Sub, upon execution of a joinder agreement to become party to the Merger Agreement (a “Joinder”), a to-be-formed Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and (iii) PHP Ventures Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“PHP Ventures”). 
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, PHP Ventures and Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger, pursuant to which PHP Ventures shall be merged with and into Merger Sub with Merger Sub being the surviving entity (the “Surviving Company”), following which the separate corporate existence of PHP Ventures shall cease, and Merger Sub shall change its name to Modulex Cayman Limited and continue as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Modulex.
 
Merger Consideration
 
As consideration for the Merger, the holders of Modulex securities collectively shall be entitled to receive from us, in the aggregate, a number of our securities with an aggregate value equal to (the “Merger Consideration”) Six Hundred Million U.S. Dollars ($600,000,000).
 
Prior to the Effective Time, Modulex will complete the Recapitalization. The pro forma equity valuation of Modulex upon consummation of the Transactions is estimated to be approximately $600 million, assuming no redemptions. Each (a) share of PHP Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for one Modulex Ordinary Share; (b) warrant of PHP entitling the holder to purchase one share of PHP Common Stock per warrant at a price of $11.50 per whole share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by Modulex and will become a Modulex warrant entitling the holder to purchase one Modulex Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per share; and (c) right of PHP entitling the holder to purchase one share of PHP Common Stock per ten PHP rights will automatically be exchanged at the Effective Time whereby each set of ten PHP rights will be converted to one Combined Company Ordinary Share (and only sets of ten PHP rights will convert so any remaining PHP rights less than ten will expire).
 
The Business Combination Agreement provides that if, between the effectiveness of the Recapitalization and the Effective Time, (a) the outstanding Modulex Ordinary Shares shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), split-up, combination or exchange or readjustment of shares, (b) a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities of Modulex shall be declared with a record date within such period, or (c) any similar event shall have occurred, then in each case Modulex Ordinary Shares issuable hereunder in exchange for PHP Ventures Securities shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders thereof the same economic effect as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement prior to such event.
 
We estimate that, upon consummation of the Transactions, assuming none of PHP’s public stockholders demand redemption (“SPAC Redemptions”) pursuant to the Existing PHP Charter, the securityholders of Modulex will own approximately 72.3% of the outstanding one Modulex Ordinary Shares, and the securityholders of PHP and investors in Modulex’s Pre-Transaction Financing will own the remaining one Modulex Ordinary Shares. We estimate that if all of PHP’s public stockholders demand redemptions pursuant to the Existing PHP Charter, upon consummation of the Transactions, the securityholders of Modulex will own approximately 72.3% of the outstanding Modulex Ordinary Shares, and the securityholders of PHP and investors in Modulex’s Pre-Transaction Financing will own the remaining one Modulex Ordinary Shares.

The Business Combination Agreement and related agreements are further described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2022.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not assume the closing of the Business Combination, or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.  
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We will seek to capitalize on the significant relationships of Mr. Ngoh, along with other members of our Board and management team, to identify, evaluate and acquire opportunities with businesses in the consumer products and services sector and have developed a wide network of professional services contacts and business relationships in that industry.
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that can benefit from (i) the managerial and operational experience of our management team, (ii) additional capital and (iii) access to public securities markets. We plan to leverage our management team’s network of potential proprietary and public transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience in the technology sector could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses to improve their overall value.
 
There is no geographic limitation to the location of potential targets, as these types of opportunities are not necessarily bound by geography.   
 
Our Acquisition Criteria
 
We intend to seek candidates with a total enterprise value from $100 million to $300 million that demonstrates one or more of the following characteristics:
 
● strong core business with a competitive market position that has demonstrated competitive advantages, well-established barriers to entry, unique characteristics that are difficult to replicate, have multiple opportunities for growth and operate in emerging markets with strong fundamentals;
 
● attractive financial profile that has a demonstrated history of strong financial performance coupled with multiple vectors for continued future growth and strong operating margins that result in sustainable cash flow generation in current times and post-pandemic recovery;
 
● trusted and experienced management team with a proven track record of driving growth, enhancing profitability and implementing sound strategic decisions;
 
● strong working culture and internal working dynamics that has cultivated a robust corporate mindset that is mission-driven and is committed to a defined set of core values that will strengthen operations and enhance execution, while benefiting from our knowledge, capabilities, and expertise to improve through innovation, digitization and technology driven advancement; and/or
 
● platform for organic (and potentially inorganic growth) using our expertise and extensive networks to source proprietary business or acquisition opportunities to accelerate the growth trajectory of a target business with broader access to debt and equity capital, liquidity and incentives for employees and a currency for potential acquisitions and expanded brand and growth initiatives.
 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. We may use other criteria and guidelines as well. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that fact in our shareholder communications related to the acquisition.

Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to seek to determine a company’s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review may include, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, technology diligence, multiple meetings with management, consultations with relevant industry and academic experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as a review of additional information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, if we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members of our board of directors would be involved in the process for considering and approving the transaction.
 
Members of our management team, including our officers and directors, directly or indirectly own our securities and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Each of our officers and directors, as well as our management team, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination, including if the retention or resignation of any such officers, directors, and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination.
 
We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.
 
Each of our directors, director nominees and officers presently have and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
 
Our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination and their respective participation in any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in respect of determining to which such company a particular business combination opportunity should be presented, particularly in the event there is overlap among the investment mandates of such companies. Additionally, one of our directors, Mr. Stein, has invested in other blank check companies. We do not believe Mr. Stein’s investments would affect our ability to identify and pursue business opportunities or complete our initial business combination.

Moreover, because our management team has significant experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously and we are not limited by industry or geography in terms of the acquisition opportunities we can pursue, except with respect to our prohibition from seeking target acquisitions in China and Hong Kong. In addition, our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we complete one or more initial business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination.
 
Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination target, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business for the post-acquisition company to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
 
Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for the purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
The net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the placement units released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our initial business combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as described above.
 

12
--


There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances, or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. Currently, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our sponsors, officers, directors, or stockholders are required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. We may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search for and completion of our initial business combination.
 
Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account; or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares: (a) on any initial business combination, or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to: (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, or (y) amend the foregoing provisions, unless (in connection with any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) we offer our public stockholders the opportunity to redeem their public shares
