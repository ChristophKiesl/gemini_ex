Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
 
We intend to simplify and streamline digital financial services for corporations, small and midsized enterprises (“SMEs”) and consumers through innovative payment processing, reconciliation and digital banking technologies that complement our core merchant services capabilities. Our company’s merchant services provide financial processing for businesses to accept cashless and/or contact less payments, such as credit cards, ACH, wireless payments, and more. Our patented, exclusively licensed, and proprietary merchant services software offers, or will offer, integrated solutions for friction less digital and mobile payment acceptance including acceptance of alternative payment methods (“APMs”); we are supplementing these capabilities with software that solves for multi-use case, multi-channel, API-driven, account-based issuer processing for card, digital tokens, and payment transfer transactions. Our innovative and scalable business model allows for expansive white-labeling, SaaS, and embedded payment solutions that will drive the digital transformation of financial services and generate diverse revenue streams for our company.
 
We believe the financial services industry is going through a period of intensive change driven by the advancement of technology, the adaptation to societal changes resulting from COVID-19, and otherwise, and the rapid rise of contactless transactions. End-users are beginning to expect ease of use and an enhanced user experience in all of their daily financial transactions. In this rapidly evolving digital marketplace, merchants have broad and frequently changing requirements for payment processing to meet consumer expectations and operational requirements. Our flexible and configurable financial services platform will enable us to provide solutions that meet each merchant’s current needs while providing scope to solve for their future development plans and opportunities allowing merchants to take advantage of future platform development and new innovative digital financial solutions through clean APIs and our scalable global infrastructure. By taking a holistic view of all aspects of our clients’ business, including risk, volume, user experience, integration capabilities and technical needs, we are able to create optimal and extensible financial technology solutions. Merchants and independent software vendors (“ISVs”) that require integrated financial technology solutions to best serve their customers are looking beyond basic payment acceptance and “lowest price” models. These entities recognize that staying competitive in the digital age requires a partner that provides a platform capable of delivering flexibility and growth while streamline operations to continue increase revenue and profitability. While we offer extremely competitive pricing, we believe the value we create for merchants, SMEs, ISVs and regional banking institutions through our technology, services and consultative approach will create true differentiation from our competitors.

Through exclusive licensing and partnership agreements, we believe we will become leaders in the embedded payment and digital banking sectors by supporting digital, tokenized, multi-channel, embedded API-driven transactions. We will augment this position through the integration of our merchant services and secure text payment solution with extensive digital account-based and multi-channel issuer payment processing capabilities. This will enable us to provide our merchant customers an end-to-end payment acceptance and digital banking solution and will power straight-through processing and embedded payments opportunities in the B2B space.
 
A key to the company’s success and market penetration relies on the continued development of enterprise-grade, patent protected software for SMS text payments via a mobile device. Our patented technology manages text messaging for processing payments, notification, response, authentication, marketing, advertising, information queries and reports. Our software platform will extend merchants’ marketplace capabilities creating new avenues and channels to request and receive frictionless, digital payments and engage end-users utilizing a familiar, convenient and widely adopted technology.
 
Once an account is established through a multi-currency digital wallet, internet connectivity or a specific application are not required to process payments between merchants and end-users. These features will be particularly beneficial for the unbanked and under banked individuals in developing and emerging markets where access to the internet on a mobile device and modern banking institutions may not be readily available. 
 
We believe our technologies will greatly increase the adoption of mobile payments and alternate banking solutions in a sector that appears to have little alternative but to adapt and migrate towards new technologies that facilitate convenient and safe contactless payments. To survive and succeed in this environment, businesses may need to adopt new technologies to engage, communicate and process payments with their customers. We believe that, by embracing technological advancement in the payment and banking industries, we are aligned in the precise direction that our current and prospective customer base is trending towards. We intend for our current and future products to be at the forefront in providing solutions that enable and facilitate these anticipated changes.
 
We are also expanding upon our financial technology foundation into the telehealth and remote patient monitoring sectors in response to cultural shifts and new healthcare demands of society. We have identified a need for the integration of payment acceptance technologies into the burgeoning telehealth sector. We believe this sector’s focus to date has been on providing health-related telecommunications but the way in which fees and payments for these services are requested and accepted is being overlooked. We intend to fill this identified shortfall by developing technologies and payment-related services to aid companies providing telehealth solutions. Through a strategic partnership, we plan to help bring to market personal emergency response and remote patient monitoring services and equipment to help ensure the safety of the elderly and injured or sick patients while providing peace of mind to family members, care givers and retirement communities. These solutions increase patients’ access to comprehensive care options and allow medical teams to intervene in a timely manner to avoid more serious health concerns. By providing financial and administrative services we will have the opportunity to receive substantial revenue share from recurring revenue billed through Medicare with the potential for substantial growth and substantial profit margins.

Industry Overview
 
The financial technology and payment processing industries are an integral part of today’s worldwide financial structure. The electronic payments industry is massive, with growth fueled by powerful long-term trends that continue to increase the acceptance and use of electronic payments compared to paper-based payments. According to The Nilson Report, purchase volume on credit, debit and prepaid cards in the United States was approximately $6.1 trillion in 2018 and is estimated to reach nearly $10.4 trillion by 2027, a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 6.1%.

The payment processing industry continues to evolve rapidly, based on the application of new technology and changing customer needs. Changes in technology have allowed for new payment methods, such as mobile and contactless payments, and merchants increasingly need new methods of interacting with their customers, deliver a frictionless experience and to ensure loyalty and repeat business. As consumers continue to integrate mobile devices into their lives, there will be increased demand to conduct business on these devices. According to Businesswire, the global mobile payment market was valued at $1,449.56 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach over $5,399.6 billion in 2026 with growth at a CAGR of 24.5% over the forecast period (2021 - 2026).
 
GSMA Intelligence reported in 2019 that globally, there are more than 9.2 billion mobile connections and 5.1 billion mobile subscribers with text messaging capabilities. Statista asserted that just over 3.9 billion of these devices have access to mobile internet.
 
The pandemic environment of 2020 added fuel to the fire and accelerated these trends in a way no one could have predicted. An Accenture study found that a total of 2.7 trillion transactions worth $48 trillion shifted from cash to other forms of payments, representing a $300 billion opportunity for payment providers. The pandemic also narrowed the generational gap between digital payment preferences, with nearly two thirds (64%) of consumers saying they used contactless cards during the pandemic.
 
Telehealth uses information and communication technology to overcome distance barriers and improve access to healthcare. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global telehealth market size was valued at $61.40 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $559.52 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 25.2% during the forecast period. Reports and Data reported the remote patient monitoring market is forecast to reach $2.14 billion by 2027 with a CAGR of 14.1%.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our adaptable technology and holistic product offering differentiate us from our competitors. Our products, many of which could be launched in a matter of months, help to eliminate much of our sector’s reliance on legacy payment rails and financial systems. Management believes by not being restricted by antiquated foundational technology the applicability and frictionless nature of our products will offer an immediate impact on the digital financial services industry. Further, while technologically advanced, the products will be comfortable to end-users allowing for a seamless adoption.
 
The patent protection to some of our products is uncommon within the fintech industry. This protection prevents competitors from trying to replicate our products in order to carve away at our anticipated market share. Therefore, backing our text payment and lead generation products with patents strengthens the viability of such products by limiting direct competition.
 
Our patent protected text payment system’s anticipated capabilities also set us apart. By creating a product that permits mobile payments without the need for a data plan, internet or an application, we will have the unique ability to extend our customer base to target unbanked and underbanked individuals primarily in developing or emerging markets. Integrating consumers that are not traditionally included in the payment space will allow us to have a larger potential market than many of our competitors.
 
The features and capabilities of products we intend to bring to market allow for agile transaction processing which supports API-driven, multi-channel and secure products. The ability for such products to be embedded into other technologies while supporting multi-currency transactions set our anticipated suite of products apart from many large, established fintech companies.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We intend to grow through leveraging our existing IP, developing with strategic partner relationships that uniquely complements our core businesses and through selective acquisitions. From traditional merchant accounts to customizable inbound and outbound payment solutions, we intend to modernize and enhance the payment processing and digital banking capabilities for businesses throughout the world. Our business objective is to generate revenue based on licensing fees, synergistic product lines, processing fees, SaaS distribution and continual advancement of our IP portfolio.

Our target market is SMEs seeking to broaden their distribution through the addition of digital payment channels and SMBs looking to create competitive advantage by reducing integration complexity and streamlining their payment processing services. We also intend to target financial institutions looking to maintain their ability to compete by digitizing their financial services offerings to meet market demand, enhance their customer’s user experience through the development of innovative and user centric multi-channel, multi-currency, digital financial products. We intend to utilize a white-label SaaS delivery model, which will allow for service fees, revenue sharing and back-end processing fees. Further, by offering SMEs a full array of lead generation services, merchant services processing and digital banking technologies, we will allow them to better interact with their customers and provide additional, dynamic means of processing both inbound and outbound payments. SMEs generally lack the resources of large enterprises to invest heavily in technology. As a result, they are more dependent on service providers, such as us, to handle critical functions including payment acceptance and other support services and are likely to be early adopters of new services that will further increase their efficiency and drive growth.
 
Businesses’ financial technology needs are increasingly complex. As electronic and mobile commerce continues to grow, businesses have no alternative but to use technology to better reach their customers. We believe that delivering novel, adaptive, scalable and operationally efficient products that meet their financial services needs will result in rapid market penetration for our anticipated products launches.
 
While leveraging new technology is vital to our growth plan, it is equally important that the technology is relevant and seamlessly fits into and benefits our end-user’s everyday life. Consumers are sometimes reluctant to alter their typical routines, especially when it relates to financial services. The anticipated launch of our text payment system and broader digital banking and payments solutions will meet both these needs. We will offer payment acceptance technologies that do not rely on legacy payment rails while allowing the end-user to transact frictionless and secure payments with the comfort of text messaging. Once properly developed and rolled out, we anticipate rapid adoption.
 
We seek to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:
 

● | Increasing our customer base by offering unique and compelling, patent protected technology solutions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Driving growth in our merchant services business through new and flexible technologies, including our secure text payment system, that will enable our customers to adapt to a rapidly changing marketplace; 
● | Rolling-out our API-driven, account-based, issuer processing solution for card, digital token, and payment transfer transactions that will enable us to target multi-currency and multi-channel digital banking and embedded B2B payment opportunities;
● | Engaging end-users via lead generation and text marketing services to enable businesses to better communicate with their customers and integrate our full suite of products; 
● | Maintaining technological leadership by continuing to innovate and improve our scalable, extensible, cloud-based technology; 
● | Pursuing strategic acquisitions, investments or partnerships to complement and bolster our suite of fintech products; 
● | Creating cross-selling synergies through white-labeling or SaaS distribution enabling us to provide a holistic suite of products and services to merchants, banking institutions and SMEs; 
● | Utilizing a scalable business model to eliminate certain barriers to rapid growth; and 
● | Expanding into the telehealth sector by offering advanced remote patient monitoring technologies.

Vital to our future success is the market penetration of our current and future products. Our market penetration strategy includes four elements: (1) royalty-free licenses; (2) engaging close industry contacts; (3) utilizing potential market share shifting IP; and (4) illustrating the need for our fintech products amongst our target industry segments.
 
To gain a market share, we plan to initially offer royalty-free licenses for our text messaging and complimentary payment solutions in exchange for processing the related payments. By incentivizing potential clients with free access to advanced, patented technology, we will give clients the ability to bolster and enhance their fintech capabilities, while creating revenue streams for our full suite of products.
 
With years of fintech experience, management believes we can leverage our industry contacts and past clients in order to gain valuable contracts with businesses. Engaging individuals with the ability to integrate our products may prove invaluable. Further, through our channel partnerships, we have an expansive network of potential clients to integrate our technology into their payment processing solutions.
 
Management believes there are substantial opportunities in emerging and developing markets for our anticipated products. Our mobile payment and digital banking solutions offer innovative avenues to unbanked and underbanked communities to transact and provide remittances. Further, since internet connectivity is not required for our text payment solution, individuals with limited internet access will still be able transact. These two factors have the ability to open our products to markets with immense growth potential.
 
Companies are regularly attempting to identify ways to stay in contact with their customers and create new payment channels. Our products do precisely this. When customers sign up for our secure text payment system, clients will have the ability to integrate a text messaging waiver into the registration process. This allows for clients to have fresh, opted-in contact information which can be paired with our text messaging services for notification, response, authentication, marketing, advertising, information queries and reports. It is our intent to market these identifiable benefits to companies in order to illustrate the advantages of partnering with us. Specific industries that could utilize our secure text payment system are pharmacies, collection agencies, charitable and religious organizations, utility companies, property management companies and any business that relies upon recurring business or subscription management services.
 
Our partnership with NEC Payments’ internationally experienced and proven team of subject matter experts will enable our management to focus resources on delivering growth using the strategies described above. We will do this with full confidence that the business is being powered by innovative technology IP running on robust, secure and scalable highly-available cloud infrastructure.
 
Management believes our partnership with Silver Alert Services, LLC will be the initial foothold for our expansion in the telehealth sector. Our strategic partnership providing financial services in support of their remote patient monitoring devices has the opportunity to create substantial revenue. However, with the emergence of new telehealth platforms and the rapid shift towards e-visits, many of which require a private payer model, we believe our payment acceptance technology, specifically our embedded capabilities will have widespread application in the sector.
 
Our Products and Services
 
Merchant Services
 
Our core historical business is merchant transaction services. We create revenue by processing payments for credit and debit cards via POS (point of sale) equipment, e-commerce gateways, periodic ACH (automatic clearing house) payments and gift & loyalty programs. We currently support over 100 merchants representing dozens of market verticals in managing their financial transactions.
 
Each merchant has unique needs for payment processing. As a result, we have a variety of processing partners to meet each merchant’s requirements. In addition to these needs, we take into consideration certain aspects of each business in choosing the optimal processing partner including risk, volume, customer service, integration capabilities, product features and profitability.
 
Our processing partners include Total Systems Services (“TSYS”)/Global Payments., JetPay an NCR Payment Solutions Company, Harbortouch Payments a Shift4 Company, Cynergy Data/Priority Payments Systems Group, Novera/WorldPay and High Risk Holdings, LLC, with each providing products and services that meet each of our merchants’ needs. Currently, our partners manage our backend payment processing needs in addition to managing risk and compliance on our behalf. Through the implementation of our proprietary payment processing protocols as we grow our customer base, we will manage the risk and compliance ourselves, which will increase our margins on each transaction processed.

Using our proprietary software, together with our partnerships, we are able to offer our merchants payment integration APIs including data encryption, payment tokenization and issuing banking authorization, and the creation of white-label, merchant-specific mobile applications. As we move forward with our secure text payment system and other products, we intend to enter new partnership agreements to align with our plans to integrate advanced processing capabilities, permitting the global expansion of our financial services technologies.
 
Text Payment System
 
We are developing a comprehensive and broad mobile payment platform which, once an account is established, relies solely on SMS text messaging. By integrating our payment processing with text messaging and a digital wallet, we intend to offer the mobile payment industry’s first and only patent protected text payment system. The integration of direct, reliable, instant, and familiar text messaging with secure payments is how we believe we bridge the gap between fintech and mobile wireless systems.
 
Anticipated features of our secure mobile payments include:
 

● | Utilization of standard SMS (Short Message Services) text messaging; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A payment platform that does not require mobile internet, a data plan or a mobile application; 
● | A secure text payment protocol that can be used on all traditional and smart cellular phones on all major global carriers without any additions or modifications to the mobile user wireless plan; and 
● | Simple authentication of the end-user. 

 
We intend for our secure text payment system to offer a simple, three-step SMS text process utilizing a digital wallet, necessary to verify payee and payor identification, account numbers and fund availability for pre-registered users. Payment may be engaged by the mobile user messaging a set of keywords to an established short code managed by us, or a merchant can contact an opted-in mobile user inquiring whether they desire to make a payment. The registered user will authorize the amount and company in which they intend to remit payment.
 
Within the text payment platform there are three distinct services that are used. These include: (1) our patented text messaging platform, (2) a digital wallet and (3) payment processing. Depending on the needs of the merchant, we may provide all three services or only license our text messaging platform to a business that utilizes their own/third-party digital wallet and alternate payment processors. Through licensing agreements, we possess modern application programming interfaces (APIs) to allow licensees to develop their own, white-labeled software applications. This flexible approach allows for an opportunity for greater market penetration.
 
Our text payment system will be used by businesses seeking to maintain contact with customers and find new ways to receive payments. A utility company could contact a customer via text message informing them their bill is due, then ask if they would like to pay their bill via text message. A church could contact their parishioners asking to contribute their weekly tithe and companies can create simplistic ways to update, inform and process transactions with brand loyalists.
 
Our text payment system is still in development. Continued development including integration, testing and certification are still needed in order to be marketable. Management currently believes the text payment system will be launched in third quarter of 2021.
 
We believe this simple payment process has widespread application and potential for widespread adoption by mobile users because it utilizes a technology many end users are comfortable with and use daily. The process is quick and user-friendly allowing businesses to simply expand their payment receiving capabilities. Management believes no other product exists that provides verification of accounts and funds, authentication of user identity, and the authorization of payment processing in the same fashion as our anticipated product.

Digital Banking Platform, BaaS& Embedded Payments
 
AppTech’s white-label, digital banking technology platform with payment capabilities will equip financial institutions (FIs), technology providers and brands with a digital “bank-in-a-box” – also referred to as our Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) (“Platform”). Furthermore, our Platform will enable multi-channel, multi-currency, pure digital financial services products unlike any other providers in the world. It incorporates a “plug-and-play” capability to enact deep integration with payment gateways and POS merchant services to form an end-to-end payment acceptance and digital banking solution. In detail, we intend the Platform to enable innovative and disruptive digital distribution products including:

● | Neo-Banking for Consumers and SMEs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | B2B and Consumer Virtual Payments (VCNs); 
● | Multi-Currency Money Management and P2P Money Transfer; 
● | Payroll, Expenses Management and B2C and G2C disbursements; 
● | Treasury Management; 
● | Gift, Incentive and Reward programs for retail, wholesale and employee benefits; 
● | Any other product that requires a prepaid or credit balance to be held and transacted upon.

 
Other attributes to our Platform will include:
 

● | Patented Technology including a Text-to-Pay patent that enables B2B, B2C and P2P payments via SMS. Combined with 4 mobile-to-computer messaging and lead generation patents, we can enable FIs, technology companies and businesses to unlock innovative customer experiences. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Personalization is also at the core of our BaaS. Through marketing automation capabilities, our BaaS provides an industry first online-to-offline customer attribution capability. Licensees of our BaaS will be able to link their customer’s online behavior to their buying preferences in real-time in order to personalize the selling and buying experience. 
● | Automation is delivered as a part of our BaaS and through our APIs that unlock automated financial transactions and customer experiences. For example, like Acorns and other automated financial wellness apps, our BaaS can easily be leveraged to create similar money saving experiences like round ups, i.e., rounding to the nearest dollar and depositing the difference between the purchase price and round-up into a digital bank account. 
● | Integration is central to our digital banking platform and BaaS. As such, AppTech offers developers and enterprises an open platform with flexible Rest APIs to build new payment and financial transaction features in SaaS and cloud apps. 
● | Embedded Payments are delivered as a configurable SaaS for scalability and to meet ever-evolving business goals and customer experiences.

Lead Generation
 
The lead generation industry has relied on thousands of “cold calls” that are rarely answered. According to the Mobile Marketing Association, the only wireless technology that is opened up 98% of the time is SMS text message. As a supplement to our merchant services business, we offer a patent protected SMS text messaging lead generation service for advertising, marketing and alerting our merchants’ customers directly.
 
Using the merchant’s own opted-in mobile number database, our lead generation service can regularly offer the merchants’ customers with the merchant’s latest in the products and services, promotions, discounts, appointment scheduling. Additionally, it can provide payment reminders, which can then be purchased via our text payments solution should merchants choose to utilize this service. Soliciting consumers requires added incentive and, as a solution, we plan on integrating a reward program. Management believes this will increase our merchant customers’ revenues and increase our customer base.
 
Our lead generation platform utilizes our patented text messaging capabilities to deliver text marketing services. Further, merchants and business will able to utilize data captured through the transaction which may be offered back to the merchant to leverage marketing trends.
 
By offering merchants our lead generation services, it provides an opportunity for cross-selling our text payment system. For example, a pharmacy using our services to inform their consumer that their prescription is filled can then send a follow-up text asking if the consumer is interested in paying for the prescription via our text payment. Management believes this cross-selling synergy has the ability to increase revenues for all the services we offer.
 
Our digital text messaging for marketing, advertising, information queries and alert notifications has extensive applications across numerous industries. Our past, present, and future clients will have direct access to their end user customers offering them targeted information and new services. Just as important, our technology is scalable, easily allowing us to meet the needs of our growing customer base.

The following is a visual representation of our lead generation system:
 


Our Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property is an important component to our business. Our strategy is to continue to build on our existing patent base and further develop additional patents and intellectual property as we grow our business domestically and internationally. Our management believes developing patent-based software products, integrating new technologies and creating intellectual property will significantly contribute to our performance. We also believe we will be able to leverage our existing patents to cross-license with other, leading, innovative patented technology partners.
 
We have incorporated four USPTO patents into our operational, enterprise-grade text messaging platform for SMS marketing, advertising and sales. By integrating our SMS technology with our MFA payment system, we will offer secure text payments. In addition to secure text payments, our MFA allows users to authenticate and validate in order to access private data and complete online transactions and inquiries. Our proprietary text messaging capabilities also allow users to send and receive a text message from a short code and initiate two-way chat from a mobile to a computer using only text-messaging.

Regulations
 
Various aspects of our business are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. federal, state and local regulation. Many domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and companies transmitting user information and payments via text message or other electronic means are still evolving and the interpretation of such laws and regulations are often uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and/or fines. Our services to mobile phone carriers are also further subject to certain of the rules and policies of such carriers and ongoing contractual covenants with such carriers, the violation of which may result in penalties and/or fines and possible termination of our services. Certain services we offer are also subject to rules set by various payment networks, such as Visa and MasterCard.
Association and Network Rules. While not legal or governmental regulation, we are subject to the network rules of Visa, MasterCard and other payment networks. In order to provide processing services, we are registered with Visa and/or MasterCard as a service provider for member institutions. As a processor level member of numerous networks, we are also subject to various network rules in connection with processing services and other services we provide. As such, we are subject to applicable card association, networks and national scheme rules that could subject us to fines or penalties. The payment networks routinely update and modify their requirements. Under these rules, we may potentially receive notices of non-compliance and fines, which might be related to excessive charge backs by a merchant or data security failures. Our failure to comply with the networks’ requirements or to pay the fines they impose could cause the termination of our registration and require us to stop providing payment services.
 
Dodd-Frank Act. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 was signed into law in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act provided two self-executing statutory provisions limiting the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions that became effective in July 2010. The first provision allows merchants to set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards). The second provision allows merchants to provide discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers.
 
Separately, the so-called Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. Payment network fees, such as switch fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions. In July 2011, the Federal Reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees. Effective in October 2011, debit interchange rates for card issuing financial institutions with more than $10 billion of assets are capped at $0.21 per transaction with an additional component of five basis points of the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuing financial institutions, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. The debit interchange fee would be $0.24 per transaction on a $38 debit card transaction, the average transaction size for debit card transactions. In July 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia determined that the Federal Reserve’s regulations implementing the Durbin Amendment were invalid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, or D.C. Circuit, reversed this decision on March 21, 2014, generally upholding the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the Durbin Amendment and the Federal Reserve’s rules implementing it. On August 18, 2014, the plaintiffs in this litigation filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the D.C. Circuit’s decision with respect to the interchange fee cap. We continue to monitor developments in the litigation surrounding these rules. Regardless of the outcome of the litigation, the cap on interchange fees is not expected to have a material direct impact on our results of operations.
 
15

 

In addition, the new rules contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions. Beginning in October 2011, (i) a card payment network may not prohibit a card issuer from contracting with any other card payment network for the processing of electronic debit transactions involving the issuer’s debit cards and (ii) card issuing financial institutions and card payment networks may not inhibit the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions over any card payment networks that can process the transactions. Since April 2012, most debit card issuers have been required to enable at least two unaffiliated card payment networks on each debit card. We do not expect the prohibition on network exclusivity to impact our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our clients. These regulatory changes create both opportunities and challenges for us. Increased regulation may add to the complexity of operating a payment processing business, creating an opportunity for larger competitors to differentiate themselves both in product capabilities and service delivery.
 
Federal Trade Commission Act and Other Laws Impacting our Customers’ Business. All persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our merchants are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or UDAP. In addition, there are other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, that may directly impact the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us, as the merchant’s payment processor, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the states’ attorney general have authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in UDAP or violate other laws, rules and regulations and to the extent we are processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business.
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Regulation. We are also subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (collectively, the BSA). The BSA requires, among other things, that money services businesses to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records.
 
We are additionally subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. These programs prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. We are also subject to other countries’ laws, where applicable, regarding anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime.
 
Anti-Corruption. We are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage.
 
Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We are subject to restrictions regarding telemarketing practices. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), telephone solicitations and the use of automated phone equipment is subject to strict solicitation rules. This includes the use of pre-recorded voice messages, automatic dialing, text messaging, and fax use. Absent informed consent by the consumer, commercial telemarketers are prohibited from making unwanted, unsolicited sales calls to mobile devices. The TCPA affects our ability to contact consumers in association with our secure text payment system and lead generation services. Violations of the TCPA may be enforced by the FCC or by individuals through litigation, including class actions and statutory penalties for TCPA violations ranging from $500 to $1,500 per violation, which is often interpreted to mean per phone call. While we intend to implement processes and procedures to comply with the TCPA, any failure by us or the third parties in which we rely on for data, to adhere to, or successfully implement, appropriate processes and procedures in response to existing or future regulations could result in legal and monetary liability, fines and penalties, or damage to our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act. We are subject to laws restricting the use of commercial messages, including text messaging. The Act generally prohibits the use of deceptive subject lines, must accurately identify the sender, and denote the message as an advertisement. In addition, recipients must include a clear and conspicuous explanation of how to opt-out of receiving the messages and the sender must remove the recipient within 10 business days of the receiver opting-out.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are subject to the information security standard for organizations processing, storing or transmitting credit card information. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud. As we continue to process and store credit card information, the failure to adhere to the standards has the ability to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, through partnerships with Total Systems Services, Inc. and Oracle Corporation, we are able to utilize preventative measures when we store, process or transmit cardholder data, helping us to meet PCI level 1 compliance.
Other Laws and Regulations
 
Since we collect certain information from members and users on our platform, we will be subject to current and future government regulations regarding the collection, use and safeguarding of consumer information over the Internet and mobile communication devices. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection and electronic payment services. In many cases, it may be unclear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet or mobile communication services as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of these technologies and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet and e-commerce.
 
There are a number of legislative proposals that are anticipated or pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning data protection which could affect us. Many states, for example, have already passed laws requiring notification to subscribers when there is a security breach of personal data. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, some states are interpreting their own statutes differently than federal law. This may create additional compliance burdens.
 
Legislation could be passed that limits our ability to use or store information about our users. The Federal Trade Commission FTC and various states have established regulatory guidelines issued under the Federal Trade Commission Act and various state acts, respectively, that govern the collection, use and storage of consumer information, establishing principles relating to notice, consent, access and data integrity and security. Our practices are designed to comply with these guidelines.
 
The foregoing list of laws and regulations to which we are subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously. Enactment of new laws and regulations may affect our operations, and could potentially result in increased regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and/or loss of revenue. We believe our policies and practices comply with the FTC privacy guidelines and other applicable laws and regulations. However, if our belief proves incorrect, or if these guidelines, laws or regulations or their interpretations change or new legislation or regulations are enacted, we may be compelled to provide additional disclosures to our users, obtain additional consents from our users before collecting or using their information or implement new safeguards to help our users manage our (or others’) use of their information, among other changes.
