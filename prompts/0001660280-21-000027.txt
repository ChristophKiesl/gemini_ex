Overview
We are a leading provider of Cyber Exposure solutions. Cyber Exposure is a discipline for managing, measuring and comparing cybersecurity risk in the digital era.
Digital transformation is driving radical change and is powering the economy and our social infrastructure. A digital-first economy is only sustainable if it is built with a solid cybersecurity foundation. As organizations modernize their IT infrastructures and adopt cloud or hybrid cloud architectures that are no longer housed in the confines of their corporate networks, they have less visibility and control over the security of these assets. Organizations are also increasingly implementing modern solutions, such as Internet of Things, or IoT, devices, web applications and application containers, to enable the rapid development and deployment of new products, services and business models, as well as to drive operational efficiencies. Further, safety-critical Operational Technology, or OT, such as Industrial Control Systems, are now network-connected and must be secured from cybersecurity threats. 
While other functions in an organization, such as finance and operations, have a system to help them manage and measure risk, cybersecurity risk has not historically been adequately measured or understood. Our enterprise platform provides a unified view into the organization’s state of security, enables security teams to prioritize and focus their remediation efforts, and translates vulnerability data into actionable business metrics and insights that boards of directors and executives can understand and use to make strategic decisions. We believe our Cyber Exposure solutions are transforming how cybersecurity risk is managed and measured and will help organizations more rapidly embrace digital transformation.
Our platform offerings provide broad visibility into security issues such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, internal and regulatory compliance violations and other indicators of the state of an organization’s security across IT infrastructure and applications, cloud environments and Industrial IoT and OT environments. We also provide deep analytics to help organizations score, trend and compare their cyber exposure over time, and communicate cyber risk in business terms to make better strategic decisions. Our platform offerings integrate and analyze data from our native collectors alongside IT asset, vulnerability and threat data from third-party systems and applications to prioritize security issues for remediation and focus an organization’s resources based on risk and business criticality. 
In 2020, 2019 and 2018 our total revenue was $440.2 million, $354.6 million and $267.4 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth rates of 24% from 2019 to 2020 and 33% from 2018 to 2019. Our net loss was $42.7 million, $99.0 million and $73.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash flows from operating activities were $64.2 million, $(10.7) million and $(2.6) million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our Platform Offerings
Our vision is to empower every organization to understand and reduce their cybersecurity risk. 
Our Enterprise Platform Offerings
Our enterprise platform enables organizations to answer foundational and strategic questions such as:
•Where are we exposed?
•Where should we prioritize based on risk?
•Are we reducing our exposure over time?
•How do we compare to our peers?
Our enterprise platform offerings include Tenable.io, which is our cloud-delivered software as a service, or SaaS, offering, and Tenable.sc, which is our on-premises offering, both of which provide organizations with a risk-based view of traditional and modern attack surfaces. These applications are designed with views, workflows and dashboards to deliver a complete and continuous view of all assets, both known and previously unknown, and any associated vulnerabilities,

internal and regulatory compliance violations, misconfigurations and other cybersecurity issues, prioritize these issues for remediation based on risk assessment and predictive analytics, and provide insightful remediation guidance.
Our enterprise platform offerings also include Tenable.ot, which is our on-premises solution that provides threat detection and mitigation, asset tracking, vulnerability management, and configuration control capabilities to protect OT environments, including industrial networks. Tenable.ot is sold as a stand-alone solution and integrates with Tenable.io and Tenable.sc.
Our enterprise platform offerings deliver the following capabilities:
•Live asset discovery. We can automatically discover a broad range of traditional and modern IT assets, including on-premises infrastructure, web applications, cloud environments, mobile devices, containers, IoT devices and OT systems. We use a combination of active scanning, passive network monitoring and public cloud monitoring via our connector to identify known and unknown assets on the network. Additionally, in 2020 we released Frictionless Assessment, which evaluates cloud assets and detects new vulnerabilities within a dynamic environment without having to schedule a scan or deploy an agent. 
•Automated exposure assessment. With every change in a customer’s computing environment, we can automatically assess and identify where there are vulnerabilities, internal and regulatory compliance violations and misconfigurations across assets and cloud environments, such as missing software patches or outdated software versions. In addition, we can help optimize existing security technology investments to identify indicators of cyber exposure, such as improperly configured anti-virus software.
•Deep analytics to allow for prioritization. We combine our product, vulnerability data and threat intelligence with third-party data to provide business context and enable organizations to prioritize remediation efforts based on the business criticality of the asset and the likelihood of exploit. Predictive Prioritization enables organizations to reduce business risk by focusing on the vulnerabilities with the greatest likelihood of imminently being exploited. It combines Tenable vulnerability data with third-party threat and vulnerability data across more than 150 data sources using a proprietary machine learning algorithm developed by Tenable Research and data science teams to provide clear guidance on where to focus remediation efforts. Predictive Prioritization provides a threat-based view of vulnerabilities, which is a critical component of modern risk-based vulnerability management.
•Open and extensible platform. Our enterprise platform integrates with industry-leading IT workflow, security information and event management, or SIEM, and systems management tools to accelerate remediation and provide common visibility across security and IT operations teams.
•Cyber exposure measurement. Tenable Lumin, released in 2019, leverages our expansive knowledge base of assets and vulnerabilities coupled with data science insights to help our customers objectively score, trend and benchmark cyber exposure across their organizations, including by business unit or geography, for comparison and best practices. We believe this capability is critical to help security executives effectively translate technical information and communicate cybersecurity risk to a non-technical audience, including the C-suite and the board of directors, to make better strategic decisions on where to focus investment to maximize cybersecurity risk reduction. As we continue to expand our database with more vulnerability and asset intelligence as well as additional third-party data sources, we anticipate that we will be able to leverage these insights in Lumin to measure an organization’s cyber exposure beyond vulnerabilities to overall cybersecurity program effectiveness.
Nessus
Our co-founder is the creator of Nessus, one of the most widely deployed vulnerability assessment solutions in the cybersecurity industry. Nessus underpins our enterprise platform. Since the introduction of Nessus in 1998, an extensive community of Nessus users has emerged. We continue to cultivate knowledge and affinity within this user base, which, when combined with our enterprise customers and our Tenable Research team of cybersecurity and data science experts, creates powerful network effects in the form of a continuous feedback loop of data and insights. We use these learnings to expand our assessment capabilities and coverage, continually optimize our solutions and inform our product strategy and

Nessus Essentials
We also offer a free version of our Nessus product, Nessus Essentials, which includes vulnerability and configuration assessment for a limited number of assets, but does not include access to support and certain features that Nessus Professional customers enjoy.
Technology Architecture
Our platform is built from the ground up to support the needs of modern IT assets and environments. Our platform’s scalability can meet the requirements of the largest global enterprise customers, which may require assessment for millions of assets. 
Foundational elements of our technology architecture include:
•Public cloud infrastructure for agility. Our use of the public cloud delivers agility and market responsiveness without the capital investment or time delay involved with planning, purchasing and deploying hardware. It also provides a flexible cost profile in which capacity can be quickly adjusted up or down in response to new opportunities and market demand, with relatively modest fixed costs.
•Scalability. Our platform scales up and down to continuously meet customer demands, through the use of public cloud infrastructure around the world. This approach provides elastic resources for compute, data transfer and storage, and allows us to meet the needs of even the largest global enterprises and government agencies. Our platform manages and supports millions of assets for multiple enterprise customers across a variety of industries, with the ability to process millions of application programming interface, or API, calls daily. The platform can scale to support IoT deployments that are an order of magnitude larger than IT deployments.
•Availability. Our modern architecture, leveraging state-of-the-art public cloud services, offers high availability and high performance. It provides geographic redundancy, as well as automated backup, without the need for us to build redundant infrastructure. As a result, we offer a service level agreement for Tenable.io that promises 99.95% availability to help ensure the reliability of operation for our customers.
•Extensibility and integration. Our open API and software development kit, or SDK, enables import of data from third-party sources and sensors, including competitor products, to augment our native discovery, assessment and analytics. This is essential to providing a unified view of assets, vulnerabilities and exposure across the enterprise. These capabilities also enable flexible export of our data to third party systems.
•Unified Platform. Our products are built on a unified platform with a unified data model that enables us to share data, assets and vulnerabilities across our applications so our customers can run workflows and have a consistent user experience across our products.
•Widely adopted industry standard file format. The “.Nessus” file format for vulnerability data used in all of our products is openly documented and supported by dozens of products and programming languages, which simplifies integration with our ecosystem partners’ technologies.

Our research and development expense was $101.7 million, $87.1 million and $76.7 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Backlog
We define backlog as contractually committed orders to be invoiced under our existing agreements that are not included in the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had backlog of $8.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively. We expect substantially all of the backlog at December 31, 2020 to be invoiced within the following twelve months.
Competition
The market for cybersecurity solutions is fragmented, intensely competitive and constantly evolving. We compete with a range of established and emerging cybersecurity software and services vendors, as well as homegrown solutions. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward. Our competitors include: vulnerability management and assessment vendors, including Qualys and Rapid7; diversified security software and services vendors, including IBM; endpoint security vendors with nascent vulnerability assessment capabilities, including Tanium and CrowdStrike; and providers of point solutions that compete with some of the features present in our solutions. We also compete against internally-developed efforts that often use open source 
Table of Contents

solutions.
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for cybersecurity solutions include product functionality, breadth and depth of offerings, flexibility of delivery models, ease of deployment and use, integration capabilities such as open APIs and scalability, uptime and performance. We believe that our suite of solutions generally competes favorably with respect to these factors and may serve as a complement to the solutions offered by our competitors in some cases. Some of our more established actual and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. In addition, as our market grows and rapidly changes, we expect it will continue to attract new competitors, including companies that are larger and more established than us and smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new products and services.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 21 issued patents and nine patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patents expire between 2027 and 2038 and cover our network scanning, monitoring and analysis technologies and additional features of our platform offerings. As of December 31, 2020, we had 19 registered trademarks and one trademark application pending in the United States. We view our copyrights, trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets.
We also license certain software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, unauthorized parties may still attempt to copy, reverse engineer, misappropriate or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Government Regulation
Various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies have legislation pending that could affect our business. In particular, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which came into force on May 25, 2018. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements on entities that receive or process personal data (as compared to existing EU law), along with significant penalties for non-compliance, more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers, greater rights for data subjects (potentially requiring significant changes to both our technology and operations), and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from locations in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws, and imposes substantial fines for breaches and violations (up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of consolidated annual worldwide gross revenue). 
Similarly, there are a number of federal and state level legislative proposals in the United States that could impose new obligations on us. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and creates new individual privacy rights for consumers and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling the personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, which could include our employees residing in California based on the broad definitions in the law, to provide such consumers new ways to opt out of certain sales of personal

information, and to allow for a new private cause of action for data breaches. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing more onerous data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or other requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
Like other U.S.-based IT security products, our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, specifically the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, U.S. economic and trade sanctions regulations and applicable foreign government import, export and use requirements. Certain of our products are subject to encryption controls under the EAR due to the nature of the product and its use or incorporation of encryption functionality. Under the encryption controls in the EAR, applicable products may only be exported outside of the United States with required export authorizations, such as a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. In addition to the restrictions under the EAR, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export of products and services to countries, governments, entities or persons subject to U.S. embargoes or trade sanctions.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,367 employees, including 455 employees located outside of the United States. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Certain international employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements in connection with local labor laws. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We believe in upholding a core set of values for our entire global workforce:
•One Tenable: We are united as one Tenable team. We win together. We are one team internally, with our customers, with our partners and in the market.
•We Care: About our work, about our customers, about one another and about our communities. We speak straight and we do the right thing.
•Deliver Results: We set high goals, take bold risks, measure honestly and deliver results that exceed expectations.
•What We Do Matters: The work that we do makes a difference in the world.
Our key human capital objectives are to attract, retain and develop our highly talented existing and future employees, while cultivating a diverse and inclusive workforce and environment to achieve exceptional business results. We strive to be a career destination where employees from all backgrounds are welcome and empowered, are treated with fairness and respect, can make a difference, and have the opportunity to grow.
