Overview
 TransEnterix, Inc. (the “Company”) is a medical device company that is pioneering the use of robotics to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options. The Company is focused on the commercialization and further development of its Senhance™ Surgical Robotic System (formerly known as the ALF-X ® Surgical Robotic System) (the “Senhance System”), a multi-port robotic system that brings the advantages of robotic surgery to patients while enabling surgeons with innovative technology. The Company also developed the SurgiBot™ System, a single-port, robotically enhanced laparoscopic surgical platform. The Senhance System has been granted a CE Mark in Europe for laparoscopic abdominal and pelvic surgery, as well as limited thoracic operations excluding cardiac and vascular surgery, but is not available for sale in the U.S. The SurgiBot System is not available for sale in any market.
 The Senhance System is a multi-port robotic surgery system which allows multiple arms to control robotic instruments and a camera. The system features advanced technology to enable surgeons with haptic feedback and the ability to move the camera via eye movement. The system replicates laparoscopic motion that is familiar to experienced surgeons, and features three-dimensional high definition (“3DHD”) vision technology. The Senhance System also offers responsible economics to hospitals by offering robotic technology with reusable instruments with minimal additional costs per surgery.
 The SurgiBot System is designed to utilize flexible instruments through articulating channels controlled directly by the surgeon, with robotic assistance, while the surgeon remains patient-side within the sterile field. In June 2015, the Company submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA for the SurgiBot System. On April 19, 2016, the FDA notified the Company that the SurgiBot System did not meet the criteria for substantial equivalence based on the data and information submitted by TransEnterix in the 510(k) submission. After interactions with the FDA, the Company determined that a new 510(k) application would need to be submitted in order to obtain clearance for the SurgiBot System. Based on this fact, we have evaluated the operational and financial feasibility of pursuing two 510(k) applications in parallel and have elected to primarily focus our near term U.S. regulatory efforts on the 510(k) submission for the Senhance System, and our current strategy is to focus our resources on the commercialization of and U.S. regulatory clearance for the Senhance System.
 Consequently, in May 2016, the Company implemented a restructuring plan. The restructuring plan resulted in: 1) reducing the Company’s workforce; 2) abandoning certain equipment; 3) cancelling certain contracts; 4) writing down inventory related to the SurgiBot System; and 5) writing off certain patents.
 We believe that future outcomes of minimally invasive surgery will be enhanced through our combination of more advanced tools and robotic functionality which are designed to: (i) empower surgeons with improved precision, dexterity and visualization; (ii) improve patient satisfaction and enable a desirable post-operative recovery; and (iii) provide a cost-effective robotic system, compared to existing alternatives today, for a potentially wide range of clinical applications. Our strategy is to focus on the development and commercialization of the Senhance System.
 Recent Corporate Transaction
 On September 18, 2015, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Sofar S.p.A., (“Sofar”) as seller, Vulcanos S.r.l. (“Vulcanos”), as the acquired company, and TransEnterix International, Inc. (“TransEnterix International”), a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company which was incorporated in September 2015, as buyer. The closing of the transactions occurred on September 21, 2015 (the “Closing Date”) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the membership interests of Vulcanos from Sofar (now known as the “Senhance Acquisition”), and changed the name of Vulcanos to TransEnterix Italia S.r.l (“TransEnterix Italia”). For a description of the Senhance Acquisition and related transactions, see the disclosure titled “Senhance Acquisition and Related Transactions” under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.

Market Overview
 Over the past two decades, laparoscopic surgery has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery. In laparoscopic surgery, multiple incisions are necessary to provide surgical access ports. Carbon dioxide gas insufflation is then used to create room in the body cavity, and long rigid instruments are introduced through ports placed in the incisions to perform surgical tasks. Millions of laparoscopic surgical procedures across a broad range of clinical applications are now performed each year worldwide, though many surgeries are still performed in an open fashion.
 While laparoscopy has improved the invasive nature of many previously open procedures, it still has many limitations. Traditional, or rigid, laparoscopy still requires multiple incisions to achieve the visualization and instrument triangulation required to perform successful surgery. Rigid laparoscopy also creates physical challenges by forcing the surgeon’s hands and arms into awkward angles, requiring the surgeon to hold instruments in fixed positions for long periods of time, and requiring an assistant to stabilize and move a laparoscopic camera. Another challenge associated with rigid laparoscopic surgery is the creation of a cumbersome and potentially tissue-damaging fulcrum at the patient’s abdominal wall where instruments are manipulated. Nearly all laparoscopic instruments are rigid instruments that lack the internal articulation required to enhance dexterity in complex tasks. Most laparoscopic surgeries are performed with two-dimensional (“2-D”) visualization of the operative field, making depth perception difficult.
 Despite such limitations, traditional laparoscopy remains the prevalent technique in minimally invasive surgery. We believe that robotic devices that replicate laparoscopic motion are more comfortable for surgeons to adopt, thereby increasing the opportunity to enhance traditional surgical methods with robotics. Our Senhance System mimics laparoscopic surgery.
 Robotic and computer controlled assistance have developed as technologies that offer the potential to improve upon many aspects of the laparoscopic surgical experience. Hundreds of thousands of robotic-assisted surgical procedures are now performed each year worldwide, but they still represent a small fraction of the total laparoscopic procedures performed. While initial widespread adoption of robotic-assisted surgery was focused on urologic and gynecologic procedures that were primarily performed in an open fashion prior to robotics, recently developed robotic approaches have been applied to many other clinical applications, particularly in general surgery. Despite recent advances, we believe there remain many limitations associated with current robotic-assisted surgery systems used in connection with laparoscopic surgeries.
 Product Overview
 We are addressing the challenges in laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery with innovative products and product candidates that leverage the best features of both approaches to minimally invasive surgery.
Current Product Offering
 Senhance System
 The Senhance System is a multi-port robotic surgery system which allows up to four arms to control robotic instruments and a camera. The system builds on the success of laparoscopy by enhancing the traditional features that surgeons have come to expect from existing products and by addressing some of the limitations associated with robotic surgery systems for laparoscopic procedures. The Senhance System also offers responsible economics to hospitals by offering robotic technology with reusable instruments with minimal additional costs per surgery when compared to laparoscopy. The Senhance System has been granted a CE Mark in Europe for use in abdominal and pelvic surgery, but is not available for sale in the U.S.
 Key features of the Senhance System are:
  
• | Haptic Feedback: The Senhance System’s haptic feedback feature provides the surgeon with the ability to feel the tactile response of the body during a procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Vision: The Senhance System features 3DHD vision technology and gives the surgeon the ability to move the camera via eye movement so that the camera is centered in the surgeon’s field of vision.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Laparoscopic Motion: The Senhance System utilizes laparoscopic motion that is similar to the motion used during traditional laparoscopic surgeries.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | View of the Sterile Field: The Senhance System offers the user an open view of the operating room and sterile field from the console.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enables Use of Standard Trocars: The Senhance System allows for standard laparoscopic trocars to be used and does not require that robotic arms be docked directly to the patient.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5


The Senhance System is manufactured for us under contract by a third party manufacturer. We or our manufacturer acquire raw materials and components of the Senhance System from vendors, some of which are sole suppliers. We believe our relationships with our vendors and manufacturing contractor are good. We further believe that we have the manufacturing and inventory reserves to meet our anticipated Senhance System sales for the foreseeable future. We are currently taking steps to develop redundant manufacturing and supply alternatives.
 Products in Development
 SurgiBot System Robotic Platform
 The SurgiBot System is designed to utilize flexible instruments through articulating channels controlled directly by the surgeon, with robotic assistance, while the surgeon remains patient-side within the sterile field. In June 2015, the Company submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA for the SurgiBot System. On April 19, 2016, the FDA notified the Company that the SurgiBot System did not meet the criteria for substantial equivalence based on the data and information submitted by TransEnterix in the 510(k) submission. After interactions with the FDA, the Company determined that a new 510(k) application would need to be submitted in order to obtain clearance for the SurgiBot System. Based on this fact, we have evaluated the operational and financial feasibility of pursuing two 510(k) applications in parallel and have elected to primarily focus our near term regulatory efforts on the 510(k) submission for the Senhance System, and our current strategy is to focus our resources on the commercialization of and regulatory clearance for the Senhance System.
 Key features of the SurgiBot System are:
  
• | Patient Side: The SurgiBot System is positioned next to the operating table, thereby allowing the surgeon, as operator, to control the system from within the sterile field next to the patient.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Precision with Scaling: The SurgiBot System allows the user to adjust the level of mechanized movement using scaled ratios.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strength: The SurgiBot System features powered motion driven by motors controlled by the surgeon.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ergonomics: The SurgiBot System stabilizes multiple instruments and a laparoscope and allows the surgeon to reposition his or her hands in an ergonomic fashion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Internal Triangulation: The SurgiBot System utilizes a deployment mechanism to achieve triangulation of multiple instruments inside the body as contrasted with other single-port robotic systems that rely on crossing instruments at the patient’s abdominal wall. The SurgiBot System allows for triangulation that can be adjusted in the surgical field during a procedure and be maintained at positions throughout a body cavity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct Surgeon Connection to the Instruments: The SurgiBot System allows the surgeon-operator to maintain human tactile feedback along several degrees of motion. Existing robotic systems lack any such tactile feedback.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Products
 SPIDER Surgical System
 Prior to 2015, TransEnterix Surgical developed and commercialized the SPIDER ® Surgical System (the “SPIDER System”), a manual laparoscopic system, in the United States, Europe and the Middle East. The SPIDER System utilized flexible instruments and articulating channels that were controlled directly by the surgeon, allowing for multiple instruments to be introduced via a single site. The SPIDER System was cleared by the FDA in 2009 and CE Marked in August 2011. The Company also manufactured multiple instruments that could be deployed using the disposable SPIDER System. As of December 31, 2014, we ceased all commercialization efforts with respect to the SPIDER System in order to fully focus our efforts on our other products.
Surgical Instruments
 The Company has developed and manufactures flexible and rigid laparoscopic surgical instruments that are used in abdominal surgery, such as scissors, graspers, clip appliers, and suction and irrigation instruments. Such instruments were sold in limited volumes in connection with the SPIDER System, and have been adapted for use with the SurgiBot System.
 In the year ended December 31, 2016, we had one European customer, Humanitas Hospital in Milan, Italy, who accounted for 100% of our revenue of our Senhance System products. On February 23, 2017, the Company announced that it made its second sale of the Senhance System to a customer in Germany. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had no revenue, as we focused our efforts on the SurgiBot System development and the Senhance Acquisition. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we had one U.S. customer who accounted for 37% of our revenue for products that included the SPIDER System. The Company is not dependent on

current customers. Please see the disclosure in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Segments” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report regarding the geographic locations of our revenues and assets in the U.S. and elsewhere.
 Business Strategy
 Our current strategy is to focus our resources on the commercialization of and U.S. regulatory clearance for the Senhance System. After  interactions with the FDA, we determined that a new 510(k) application would need to be submitted in order to obtain clearance for the SurgiBot System. Based on this fact, we have evaluated the operational and financial feasibility of pursuing two 510(k) applications in parallel and have elected to primarily focus our near term efforts on the 510(k) submission for the Senhance System.
 We believe that:
  
• | there are a number of hospitals and an increasing number of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. and internationally that could benefit from the addition of robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery and, with the Senhance System, lower operational costs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | with the Senhance System, surgeons can benefit from the haptic feedback, enhanced 3DHD vision and open architecture consistent with current laparoscopic surgery procedures; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients will continue to seek a minimally invasive option for many common general abdominal and gynecologic surgeries, which are addressed by the Senhance System.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 We have recruited an initial sales and marketing team and have initiated initial commercialization of the CE-marked Senhance System in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and limited countries in Asia.  We utilize distributors and sales agents in a number of jurisdictions where we do not sell directly.  Our distribution agreements typically provide exclusivity in a specific territory or jurisdiction. To date we have agreements with ten distributors or sales agents for the Senhance System.
 We have initiated a Clinical Leadership Program with leading surgical centers in Europe to utilize the Senhance System. We believe the program helps improve our visibility in Europe and provides more widespread opportunity for observation of robotic surgery with the Senhance System. We opened three such Clinical Leadership Program sites in 2016 and anticipate adding a fourth in early 2017. In addition, in December 2016 we opened a new European training and research and development center in Milan, Italy.
 Research and Development
 During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred research and development expenses of approximately       $29.3 million, $29.7 million and $27.9 million, respectively. In 2016, such expenses primarily related to the SurgiBot System development and the Senhance System development, including the preparation and submission of regulatory filings. In 2015 and 2014, such expenses primarily related to the SurgiBot System development, including the preparation and submission of regulatory filings. We fund our research and development expenses primarily from proceeds raised from equity and debt financing transactions. We expect to continue to use equity and debt financing transactions to fund our research and development activities. No customers are obligated to pay any material portion of such research and development expenses.
Intellectual Property
 We believe that our intellectual property and expertise is an important competitive resource. Our experienced research and development team has created a substantial portfolio of intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We maintain an active program of intellectual property protection, both to assure that the proprietary technology developed by us is appropriately protected and, where necessary, to assure that there is no infringement of our proprietary technology by competitive technologies.
 The following summarizes our current patent and patent application portfolio.
 Patents and Patent Applications Owned by the Company: The Company holds nine United States patents, three Italian patents, one Russian patent, a European patent, two Japanese patents, two Australian patents and a Chinese patent, and it has more than forty patent applications filed in the United States and abroad. In each instance, we own all right, title and interest, and no licenses, security interests or other encumbrances have been granted on such patents and patent applications.

Several of our issued patents resulted from filings related to the Senhance System.  These include one of the United States patents, and the Italian, Russian and Chinese patents. The earliest to expire patents within this part of our portfolio will remain in force until 2030.  Two of our United States patents resulted from filings relating to the SurgiBot System developed by the Company and will remain in force until 2033. Three of our United States patents and the European, Japanese and Australian patents resulted from filings relating to the SPIDER System, which the Company stopped selling as of December 31, 2014.  The earliest to expire patents within this part of our portfolio will remain in force until 2027. The patent applications relate to the Senhance System, the SurgiBot System and the SPIDER System, and other instruments and systems for minimally invasive surgical procedures. We intend to seek further patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and internationally, where available and when appropriate, as we continue our product development efforts.
 Patents and Patent Applications Licensed to the Company: TransEnterix Italia has exclusively licensed technology, know-how, patents and patent applications relating to the Senhance System from the European Union. This licensed portfolio includes two issued US patents which will remain in force until 2030, and at least fifteen patents issued in other countries, including two European patents, three Korean patents, three Japanese patents and three Chinese patents, which expire in 2027. At least fifteen additional patent applications are pending, including three in the United States.
 The license agreement with the European Union has a term which runs until the final licensed patent expires, unless the agreement is terminated earlier by mutual consent of the parties or for breach. The Company is currently in compliance with the terms of this license agreement.
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more established and developed than ours.
 There are many competitive offerings in the field of minimally invasive surgery. Several companies have launched devices that enable reduced incision or single incision laparoscopic surgery with or without robotic assistance. Our surgical competitors include, but are not limited to: Applied Medical, Medtronic plc, Intuitive Surgical, Titan Medical and Verb Surgical.
 In addition to surgical device manufacturer competitors, there are many products and therapies that are designed to reduce the need for or attractiveness of surgical intervention. These products and therapies may impact the overall volume of surgical procedures and negatively impact our business.
 Our ability to compete may be affected by the failure to fully educate physicians in the use of our products and products in development, or by the level of physician expertise. This may have the effect of making our products less attractive. Among currently available surgical robotic systems, we expect the Senhance System to differentiate on the basis of its use of standard trocars and lower per procedure costs; and we expect the Senhance System to differentiate, in most cases, its ability to provide the surgeon with tactile feedback. Several medical device companies are actively engaged in research and development of robotic systems or other medical devices and tools used in minimally invasive surgery procedures. We cannot predict the basis upon which we will compete with new products marketed by others.
 Government Regulation of our Product Development Activities
 The U.S. government and foreign governments regulate the medical device industry through various agencies, including but not limited to, the U.S. FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). The design, testing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, distribution, advertising, and marketing of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries, including the European Union. Any device product that we develop must receive all requisite regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country.
Device Development, Marketing Clearance and Approval
 Medical devices are subject to varying levels of pre-market regulatory requirements. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes: (i) Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls; (ii) Class II devices are somewhat more complex and receive greater scrutiny from the FDA and have heightened regulatory requirements; and (iii) Class III devices are new, high risk devices, and frequently are permanently implantable or help sustain life and generally require a Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) by the FDA.

In the United States, a company generally can obtain permission to distribute a new medical device in one of two ways. The first applies to any device that is substantially equivalent to a device first marketed prior to May 1976, or to another device marketed after that date, but which was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 1976 device. These devices are either Class I or Class II devices. To obtain FDA clearance to distribute the medical device, a company generally must submit a Section 510(k) notification, and receive an FDA order finding substantial equivalence to a predicate device (pre-May 1976 device or post-May 1976 device that was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 1976 device) and permitting commercial distribution of that medical device for its intended use. A 510(k) notification must provide information supporting a claim of substantial equivalence to a single medical device, the predicate device. If clinical data from human experience are required to support the 510(k) notification, these data must be gathered in compliance with investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations for investigations performed in the United States. The 510(k) process is normally used for products of the type that we are developing and propose to market and sell. The FDA review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant to Section 510(k) takes, pursuant to statutory requirements, 90 days, but it can take substantially longer if the FDA has questions regarding the regulatory submission. It is possible for Section 510(k) clearance procedures to take from six to twenty-four months, depending on the concerns raised by the FDA and the complexity of the device. There is no guarantee that the FDA will “clear” a medical device for marketing, in which case the device cannot be distributed in the United States. There is also no guarantee that the FDA will deem the applicable device subject to the 510(k) process, as opposed to the more time-consuming, resource-intensive and problematic PMA process described below. In 2011, the FDA issued a series of draft guidance documents designed to reform the 510(k) clearance process. Similarly, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 authorized the FDA to collect user fees for the review of certain pre-market submissions received on or after October 1, 2012, including 510(k) notifications.
 The second, more comprehensive, approval process applies to a new device that is not substantially equivalent to a pre-1976 product or that is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices. For example, most implantable devices are subject to the approval process as a Class III device. Two steps of FDA approval are generally required before a company can market a product in the United States that is subject to approval, as opposed to clearance, as a Class III device. First, a company must comply with IDE regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device. These regulations permit a company to undertake a clinical study of a “non-significant risk” device without formal FDA approval. Prior express FDA approval is required if the device is a significant risk device. Second, the FDA must approve the company’s PMA application, which contains, among other things, clinical information acquired under the IDE. Additionally, devices subject to PMA approval may be subject to a panel review to obtain marketing approval and are required to pass a factory inspection in accordance with the current “good manufacturing practices” standards in order to obtain approval. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process, approximately one to two years or more. However, in some instances the FDA may find that a device is new and not substantially equivalent to a predicate device but is also not a high risk device as is generally the case with Class III PMA devices. In these instances FDA may allow a device to be down classified from Class III to Class I or II. The de novo classification option is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices of low to moderate risk that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a “not substantially equivalent” (“NSE”) determination in response to a 510(k) notification. The regulations have also been amended to allow a sponsor to submit a de novo classification request to the FDA for novel low to moderate risk devices without first being required to submit a 510(k) application. These types of applications are referred to as “Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation” or “de novo.” In instances where a device is deemed not substantially equivalent to a Class II predicate device, the candidate device may be filed as a de novo application which may lead to delays in regulatory decisions by the FDA. FDA review of a de novo application may lead the FDA to identify the device as either a Class I or II device and worthy of either an exempt or 510(k) regulatory pathway.
 We believe that the Senhance System and related products are Class II devices, and we are in the process of pursuing Section 510(k) clearance for the Senhance System. The FDA might find that the 510(k) submission does not provide the evidence required to prove that the Senhance System is substantially equivalent to marketed Class II devices. If that were to occur, we would be required to undertake the more complex and costly PMA process or perhaps be considered for a de novo reclassification. For either the 510(k), de novo, or the PMA process, the FDA could require us to conduct clinical trials, which would take more time, cost more money and pose other risks and uncertainties.
 Clinical studies conducted in the U.S. or used in any U.S. application on an unapproved medical device require approval from the FDA prior to initiation. Even when a clinical study has been approved by the FDA or deemed approved, the study is subject to factors beyond a manufacturer’s control, including, but not limited to, the fact that the institutional review board (IRB) at a specified clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval, or might suspend or terminate the study before its completion. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated. In addition, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure the FDA that the product is safe and effective, a prerequisite for FDA approval of a PMA, or substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a predicate device, a prerequisite for clearance under Section 510(k). Even if the FDA approves or clears a device, it may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distribution of the device may not be commercially feasible.
 9


After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain serious adverse events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval of the device, or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or require additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met.
 A manufacturer of a device approved through the PMA process is not permitted to make changes to the device which affect its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its PMA and obtaining FDA approval for that supplement, prior to marketing the modified device. In some instances, the FDA may require clinical trials to support a supplement application. A manufacturer of a device cleared through the 510(k) process must submit an additional premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source, labeling or manufacturing process. Any change in the intended uses of a PMA device or a 510(k) device requires an approval supplement or new cleared premarket notification. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements.
 Continuing FDA Regulation
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
  
• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | quality system regulations, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved, i.e. “off label,” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements to conduct postmarket surveillance studies to establish continued safety data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are required to, and have, registered with the FDA and the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) as medical device manufacturers and must obtain all necessary permits and licenses to operate our business. As manufacturers, we and our suppliers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and other regulations.
 In Europe, we need to comply with the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”) and appropriately affix the CE Mark on our products to attest to such compliance. To achieve compliance, our products must meet the “Essential Requirements” of the MDD relating to safety and performance and we must successfully undergo verification of our regulatory compliance, or conformity assessment, by a notified body selected by us. The level of scrutiny of such assessment depends on the regulatory class of the product. We are subject to continued surveillance by our notified body and will be required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. We also must comply with additional requirements of individual countries in which our products are marketed. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell products. These regulations require us or our manufacturers to manufacture products and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing, labeling and control activities.
 Impact of Regulation
 Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, among other things, any of the following sanctions:

• | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | repair, replacement, refund or seizure of our products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modifications to existing products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10


 
• | withdrawing or suspending clearances or approvals that are already granted;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution; and
--+--------------------------


• | disgorgement of profits.
--+-------------------------

 Further, the levels of revenues and profitability of medical device companies like us may be affected by the continuing efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental controls.
 Therefore, we cannot assure you that any of our products will be considered cost effective, or that, following any commercialization of our products, coverage and reimbursement will be available or sufficient to allow us to manufacture and sell them competitively and profitably.
 Health Care Regulation
 Our business activities are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 In the United States, there have been, and we expect there to continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state government levels, to change the healthcare system in ways that, if approved, could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. At the current time, our products are not defined as durable medical equipment (“DME”). Non-DME devices used in surgical procedures are normally paid directly by the hospital or health care provider and not reimbursed separately by third-party payors. Instead, the hospital or health care provider is reimbursed based on the procedure performed and the inpatient or outpatient stay. As a result, these types of devices are subject to intense price competition that can place a small manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage as hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and health care providers attempt to negotiate lower prices for products such as the ones we develop and sell.
 In March 2010, President Obama signed into law both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the reconciliation law known as Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Reconciliation Act,” and, with the Affordable Care Act, the “2010 Health Care Reform Legislation”). The constitutionality of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation was confirmed twice by the Supreme Court of the United States. Both Congressional leaders and newly elected President Trump have announced plans to repeal or modify the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation.  At this time the Company is not certain as to the impact of federal health care legislation on its business.
 The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation subjects manufacturers of medical devices to an excise tax of 2.3% on certain U.S. sales of medical devices beginning in January 2013. This excise tax was suspended in December 2015 for two years, and we anticipate that this may be repealed. If eventually implemented, this excise tax will likely increase our expenses in the future.
 Further, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation includes the Open Payments Act (formerly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act), which, in conjunction with its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of certain drugs, biologics, and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually certain payments or “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. We have provided reports under the Open Payments Act to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services since 2014. The failure to report appropriate data accurately, timely, and completely could subject us to significant financial penalties. Other countries and several states currently have similar laws and more may enact similar legislation.
 International Regulation and Potential Impact
 Through the Senhance Acquisition, the Company has expanded into international markets and intends to pursue continued expansion. Some of these markets maintain unique regulatory requirements outside of or in addition to those of the U.S. FDA and the European Union. The Senhance System is CE marked, which allows us to offer the product for sale in a number of jurisdictions, including select countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  Due to the variations in regulatory requirements within territories, the Company may 
 11


be required to perform additional safety or clinical testing or fulfill additional agency requirements for specific territories. The Company may also be required to apply for registration using third parties within those territories and may be dependent upon the third parties’ successful regulatory processes to file, register and list the product applications and associated labeling, which could lead to significant investments and resource use. These additional requirements may result in delays in international registrations and commercialization of our products in certain countries.
 In addition, we are utilizing distributors and sales agents in various territories throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and need to ensure that our activities, and the activities of our distributors and sales agents, are compliant with local law and U.S. laws governing the sales of medical devices.  The laws governing the registration, approval, clearance and sales of medical devices, such as the Senhance System, in multiple jurisdictions are complex, and the failure to comply with such laws in any given jurisdiction could subject us to financial penalties or suspension or termination of our ability to sell our products in the applicable jurisdiction.  
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 104 employees, including 103 full time employees. The Company considers its relationships with its employees to be good.

ITEM 1.A. | RISK FACTORS
----------+-------------

 We are currently highly dependent on the success of a single product, the Senhance System.  We cannot give any assurance that the Senhance System can be successfully commercialized or that it will receive regulatory clearance in the U.S.   
 We are currently highly dependent on the commercial success of the Senhance System, which is currently CE marked but not FDA cleared. We began our selling efforts for the Senhance System in the fourth quarter of 2015 and we have had limited commercial success to date.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully commercialize the Senhance System, or that the FDA will grant regulatory clearance for the Senhance System, for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, failure in our sales and marketing efforts, the potential introduction by our competitors of more clinically effective or cost-effective alternatives, or our ability to obtain regulatory clearance in a timely manner, or at all.  Failure to successfully commercialize the Senhance System would have a material and adverse effect on our business. Regulatory authorities may change requirements for the clearance of a product regardless of previous discussions with us.  These regulatory authorities may also clear a product for fewer or more limited uses than we request. In addition, the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve or clear the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our products. 
 12


We expect that our sales cycle for the Senhance System will be lengthy and unpredictable, which will make it difficult for us to forecast revenue and increase the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results. 
 Purchase of a surgical robotic system such as the Senhance System represents a capital purchase by hospitals and other potential customers.  The capital purchase nature of the transaction, the complexity of our product, the relative newness of surgical robotics and the competitive landscape requires us to spend substantial time and effort to assist potential customers in evaluating our robotic systems. We must communicate with multiple surgeons, administrative staff and executives within each potential customer in order to receive all approvals on behalf of such organizations. We may face difficulty identifying and establishing contact with such decision makers. Even after initial acceptance, the negotiation and documentation processes can be lengthy. Additionally, our customers may have strict limitations on spending given the current economic climate. We expect our sales cycle to typically range between six and twelve months, but it may be longer. Any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. We also expect such a lengthy sales cycle makes it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue in future periods and may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly in future periods.   
 Although we have recently expanded our commercial organization, we currently have limited marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. We intend to distribute our products through direct sales and independent contractor and distribution agreements with companies possessing established sales and marketing operations in the medical device industry, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in building our sales capabilities. To the extent that we enter into distribution, co-promotion or other arrangements, our product revenue is likely to be lower than if we directly market or sell our products. In addition, any revenue we receive will depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful and are generally not within our control. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. If we are not successful in commercializing our existing and future products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.
 We will need to ensure that we have procedures in place to require our distributors and sales agents to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the sales of medical devices in the jurisdictions where they operate.  Failure to meet such requirements could subject us to financial penalties or the suspension or termination of the ability to sell our products in such jurisdiction.  
 We have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
 We have a limited operating history. We are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception.  Substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of anticipated capital needs as well as past recurring losses and an accumulated deficit.   Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $120.0 million, and our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2016 was $302.8 million.  We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash received from sales of our products, will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 12 months.  
 We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses will likely increase as we continue to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates. We will continue to incur research and development and general and administrative expenses related to our operations, and expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses as we increase our sales and marketing activities for the Senhance System in Europe and other jurisdictions where CE marking provides authorization for commercial activities, and pursue our regulatory strategy in the U.S.  If our products fail in development or do not gain regulatory clearance or approval, or if our products do not achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. 
 We will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
 The net proceeds of recent equity financings, including our at-the-market offering in 2016 and the ongoing equity financing with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC commenced in December 2016, will not be sufficient to support development of our products and product candidates and provide us with the necessary resources to commercialize these products and product candidates. While we are currently focused on seeking U.S. regulatory approval for, and commercialization of, our Senhance System, we intend to advance multiple additional products through clinical and pre-clinical development in the future. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in order to continue our operations and achieve our business’ objectives. 
 We have filed two shelf registration statements which have been declared effective by the SEC. As of December 31, 2016, we had $37.8 million available for future financings.  Such capacity will expire in November 2017.  We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.
 13


Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
  
• | the costs of our Senhance System commercialization and development activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory clearances and approvals for the Senhance System;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the costs associated with establishing a sales force and commercialization capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our need to expand our research and development activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, products and technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the economic and other terms and timing of our existing licensing arrangement and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our need and ability to hire additional management, scientific, medical and sales and marketing personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effect of competing technological and market developments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems, quality systems and information technology systems; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Until we generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which may never occur, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic collaborations. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution; and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that limit our operations. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
 The surgical robotics industry is increasingly competitive, which can negatively impact our commercial opportunities. 
 The life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many medical device companies that are researching and marketing products designed to address minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery, including new entrants in the competitive market. We are currently commercializing the Senhance System in Europe which accepts a CE Mark, the Middle East and selected countries in Asia and face significant competition in such markets.  Many of our competitors, including Intuitive Surgical, have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and product development resources than we do. Some of the medical device companies we compete with or expect to compete with include Intuitive Surgical, Applied Medical, Titan Medical, Medtronic plc, Verb Surgical and a number of minimally invasive surgical device and robotic surgical device manufacturers and providers of products and therapies that are designed to reduce the need for or attractiveness of surgical intervention. In addition, many other universities and private and public research institutions are or may become active in research involving surgical devices for minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery. 
 We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things: 
  
• | the efficacy, safety and reliability of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | the speed at which we develop our products;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | our ability to commercialize and market any of our products that may receive regulatory clearance or approval;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the cost of our products in relation to alternative devices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | the timing and scope of regulatory clearances or approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | whether our competitors substantially reduce the cost of ownership of an alternative device;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to protect and defend intellectual property rights related to our products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to have our partners manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any approved products to the market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14


 
• | the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors for the procedures in which our products are used;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | acceptance of future products by physicians and other health care providers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If our competitors market products that are more effective, safer, easier to use or less expensive than our products or future products, or that reach the market sooner than our products, we may not achieve commercial success. In addition, the medical device industry is characterized by rapid technological change. It may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or products obsolete or less competitive. 
 We anticipate that the highly competitive surgical robotics environment can lead our competitors to attempt to slow or derail our commercial progress.  We are using our best efforts to enter the commercial markets effectively and efficiently while maintaining compliance with all regulatory and legal requirements.  Responding to the actions of our competitors will require the attention of our management and may distract the management team from its focus on our commercial operations and lead to increased costs of commercialization, which could have a negative impact on our financial position. 
 The regulatory approval and clearance processes are expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals or clearances, as the case may be, for the commercialization of some or all of our products. 
 In June 2015 the Company submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA for the SurgiBot System and worked with the FDA to provide additional information as requested.  On April 19, 2016, the FDA informed the Company that the SurgiBot System did not meet the substantial equivalence test based on the 510(k) application. After interactions with the FDA, the Company determined that a new 510(k) application would need to be submitted in order to obtain clearance for the SurgiBot System. Based on this fact, we have evaluated the operational and financial feasibility of pursuing two 510(k) applications in parallel and have elected to primarily focus our near term regulatory efforts on the 510(k) submission for the Senhance System. We expect to file a 510(k) submission for the Senhance System in the 2017 second quarter.  The product development and design, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, clearance, selling, marketing and distribution of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our products in the United States until we receive a clearance letter under the 510(k) process or approval of a PMA from the FDA, depending on the nature of the device. Obtaining approval of any PMA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. We can provide no assurance, even if our products are reviewed under the 510(k) premarket notification process that the FDA will review our application expeditiously or determine that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed non-PMA device. If the FDA asks questions during a 510(k) process, the time required to answer the questions can extend the time to market up to an additional six months. If we cannot sufficiently answer the questions, or for a variety of other reasons the FDA does not provide clearance for a product candidate, such as the Senhance System or the SurgiBot System, we cannot market the device. 
 Regulatory approval of a PMA, PMA supplement or clearance pursuant to a 510(k) premarket notification is not guaranteed, and the approval or clearance process, as the case may be, is expensive, uncertain and may, especially in the case of the PMA application, take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the medical device clearance process or approval process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to repeat or perform additional development, standardized testing, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The number of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA clearance or approval varies depending on the medical device candidate, the disease or condition that the medical device candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular medical device candidate. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a medical device candidate for many reasons, including: 
  
• | a medical device candidate may not be deemed safe or effective, in the case of a PMA application;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a medical device candidate may not be deemed to be substantially equivalent to a device lawfully marketed either as a grandfathered device or one that was cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a medical device candidate may not be deemed to be in conformance with applicable standards and regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA or other regulatory officials may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA might not approve our processes or facilities or those of any of our third-party manufacturers for a Class III PMA device;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15


 
• | other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve our processes or facilities or those of any of our third-party manufacturers, thereby restricting export; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may change clearance or approval policies or adopt new regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The laws governing the regulatory approval or clearance pathways in jurisdictions outside of the United States are complex.  We need to ensure that our activities, and the activities of our distributors and agents, comply with such laws.  If we do not comply with such laws, we may not be able to sell our products, including the Senhance System, in all jurisdictions we have targeted, which could have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.  
 In the second quarter of 2016 we recorded a significant charge to earnings related to our evaluation of the recoverability of identifiable intangibles, other long-lived assets, and product inventory related to our SurgiBot System. 
 We assess the recoverability of identifiable intangibles with finite lives and other long-lived assets, such as equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment.” In accordance with FASB ASC 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,” goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from acquisitions are evaluated annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment, to determine whether any portion of the remaining balance of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows or external economic or industry changes.  We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined, which could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 On April 19, 2016, the FDA notified the Company that the SurgiBot System did not meet the criteria for substantial equivalence based on the data submitted in the 510(k) submission. As a result, we reprioritized our efforts on the commercialization of and regulatory clearance for the Senhance System. Consequently, in May 2016, we implemented a restructuring plan.  The restructuring changes amounted to $5.7 million, of which $2.6 million was included as inventory write down related to restructuring and $3.1 million was included as restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, during the second quarter of 2016. The restructuring and other charges of $3.1 million included: (i) $0.5 million to be paid in cash, of which $0.4 million related to employee severance costs and $0.1 million related to cancellation of certain contracts; and (ii) $2.6 million for other non-cash charges, of which $1.0 million related to the write-off of long-lived assets for the abandonment of certain equipment and tooling directly relating to the SurgiBot System and $1.6 million related to the write-off of intellectual property for certain patents also relating to the SurgiBot System. 
 Our global operations expose us to additional risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally. 
 The international expansion of our business may expose us to risks inherent in conducting foreign operations. These risks include: 
  
• | challenges associated with managing geographically diverse operations, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the increased cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions, if we chose to do so in the future;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potentially adverse tax consequences;
--+--------------------------------------


• | complexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with additional regulations and government authorities in a highly regulated business; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general economic and political conditions outside of the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The risks that we face in our international operations may continue to intensify as we further develop and expand our international operations. 
 16


Our business may become subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with domestic and international operations. 
 Our business is subject to risks associated with conducting business domestically and internationally, in part due to some of our suppliers being located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: 
  
• | difficulties in compliance with U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in U.S. and non-U.S. regulations and customs;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates and currency controls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic environment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by U.S. or non-U.S. governments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | difficulties associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including differing labor relations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As we ramp up our manufacturing capabilities we face risks arising from sole suppliers of components and our ability to meet delivery schedules for sales of our products. 
 The Senhance System is manufactured for us under contract by a third party manufacturer. We or our manufacturer acquire raw materials and components of the Senhance System from vendors, some of which are sole suppliers. Although we believe that we have the manufacturing and inventory reserves to meet our anticipated Senhance System sales for the foreseeable future, we are currently taking steps to develop redundant manufacturing and supply alternatives. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing these redundant supply and manufacturing capabilities. If we are not successful, our business operations could suffer.
 Our stock price has been volatile and may experience additional fluctuation in the future. 
 The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.  During the two year period ended December 31, 2016, the market price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $6.10 per share to a low of $1.03 per share, and our stock price continues to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as: 
  
• | the announcement of favorable or unfavorable news regarding us, including our product development efforts and regulatory clearance activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the achievement of commercial sales of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the impact of litigation, including class action litigation, on us;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developments concerning intellectual property rights and regulatory approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | variations in our and our competitors’ results of operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developments in surgical robotics;
--+-----------------------------------


• | the results of product liability or intellectual property lawsuits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | future issuances of common stock or other securities;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | the addition or departure of key personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, the stock market in general, and the market for medical device companies in particular, has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock and the loss of some or all of your investment. 
 17


Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.
 We conduct operations in several different countries, including the U.S. and throughout Europe, and portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies, including Euros. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. We have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.  Accordingly, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies could materially affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our financial resources and our ability to operate our business.
 We are party with Silicon Valley Bank and Oxford Finance LLC (the “Lenders”), to, and jointly and severally liable with certain of our U.S. subsidiaries for, $20.0 million of outstanding debt under term loans issued under our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, as amended (the “Loan Agreement”). The maturity date of the outstanding term loan is July 1, 2018.  Our resulting substantial level of indebtedness and other financial obligations increase the possibility that we may be unable to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due in respect of, our indebtedness.  Further, under the Loan Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital requirements, product development activities, debt service requirements, and general corporate or other purposes. These restrictive covenants include, without limitation, restrictions on our ability to: (1) change the nature of our business; (2) incur additional indebtedness; (3) incur liens; (4) make certain investments; (5) make certain dispositions of assets; (6) merge, dissolve, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; (7) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (8) transfer more than designated amounts to our foreign subsidiaries during the term of the Loan Agreement.  If we breach any of these restrictive covenants or are unable to pay our indebtedness under the Loan Agreement when due, this could result in a default under the Loan Agreement. In such event, the Lenders may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable under the Loan Agreement, to be immediately due and payable. Any such occurrence would have an immediate and materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The Loan Agreement is secured by a security interest in all assets of the Company and its current and future U.S. subsidiaries, including a security interest in intellectual property proceeds, but excluding a current security interest in intellectual property.
 We are party with Sofar to the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we made the Senhance Acquisition.  A significant portion of the purchase price is payable in tranches upon the achievement of designated milestone events, which are described in Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 “Acquisition of Senhance Surgical Robotic System” of this Annual Report.  As of January 4, 2017, the maximum amount of the aggregate milestone payments under the Purchase Agreement could be €21.4 million. If we are unable to make such milestone payments when due, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  
 Even if we obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products, the terms thereof and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate anticipated revenues. 
 Once regulatory clearance or approval has been granted, the cleared or approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. Any cleared or approved product may be promoted only for its indicated uses. In addition, if the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities clear or approve any of our products, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the product will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. We and any outsourced manufacturers of our products are also required to comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or similar requirements of non-U.S. regulatory authorities which includes requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation as well as other quality system requirements and regulations from non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Further, regulatory agencies must approve our manufacturing facilities for Class III devices before they can be used to manufacture our products, and all manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspection. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, either before or after clearance or approval, or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, or if previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including: 
  
• | restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adverse inspectional observations (“Form 483”), warning letters, non-warning letters incorporating inspectional observations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | civil or criminal penalties or fines;
--+--------------------------------------


• | injunctions;
--+-------------

 18


 
• | product seizures, detentions or import bans;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances or approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | total or partial suspension of production;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to clear or approve pending applications or premarket notifications; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | import and export restrictions.
--+--------------------------------

 Any of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all. 
 In addition, the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may change their policies and additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory clearance or approval of our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we would likely not be permitted to market our future products and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 
 Once our products are cleared or approved, modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances, premarket approvals or new or amended CE Certificates of Conformity, and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances, approvals or the relevant CE Certificates of Conformity are obtained.
 Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design, or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review such determinations. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations for any future changes, or prior changes to previously marketed products, as the case may be, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified products until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 Furthermore, the FDA’s ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product must be submitted, or applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. In July and December 2011, respectively, the FDA issued draft guidance documents addressing when to submit a new 510(k) due to modifications to 510(k) cleared products and the criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence. The July 2011 draft guidance document was ultimately withdrawn as the result of the FDASIA, and as a result, the FDA’s original guidance document regarding 510(k) modifications, which dates back to 1997, remains in place. It is uncertain when the FDA will seek to issue new guidance on product modifications. Any efforts to do so could result in a more rigorous review process and make it more difficult to obtain clearance for device modifications.
 Even after clearance or approval for our products is obtained, we are subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA. Our failure to meet strict regulatory requirements could require us to pay fines, incur other costs or even close our facilities.
 Even after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, the FDA has the power to require us to conduct post-market studies. These studies can be very expensive and time-consuming to conduct. Failure to complete such studies in a timely manner could result in the revocation of clearance or approval and the recall or withdrawal of the product, which could prevent us from generating sales from that product in the United States. The FDA has broad enforcement powers, and any regulatory enforcement actions or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some surgeons from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our products. 
 We are also required to comply with the FDA’s QSR, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, shipping, installation and servicing of our marketed products. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. In addition, in the future, regulatory authorities and/or customers may require specific packaging of sterile products, which could increase our costs and the price of our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing 
 19


processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.
 If one of our products, or a malfunction of one of our products, causes or contributes to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.
 Under the FDA’s medical device reporting (“MDR”) regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all firm-initiated medical device corrections and removals, and to report such corrective and removal actions to the FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the MDR regulations. 
 All manufacturers bringing medical devices to market in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) are legally bound to report any incident that led or might have led to the death or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or other person, and which the manufacturer’s device is suspected to have caused, to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In such case, the manufacturer must file an initial report with the relevant competent authority, which would be followed by further evaluation or investigation of the incident and a final report indicating whether further action is required. 
 Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Adverse events involving our products have been reported to us in the past, and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur in the future. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.
 A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.
 The FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities such as the competent authorities of the EEA countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.
 Any future recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers’ demands. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.
 U.S. legislative or FDA regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.
 From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 20


Even if we receive regulatory clearance or approval to market our products, the market may not be receptive to our products, which could undermine our financial viability.
 Even if our products obtain regulatory clearance or approval, resulting products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors and/or the medical community. We have experienced minimal sales of our Senhance System, to date. We believe that the degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including:
  
• | timing of market introduction of competitive products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | safety and efficacy of our products;
--+-------------------------------------


• | physician training in the use of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | prevalence and severity of any side effects;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | potential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strength of marketing and distribution support; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | price of our future products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If applicable, availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors can also impact the acceptance of our product offerings.
 If we fail to attract and retain key management and professional personnel, we may be unable to successfully commercialize or develop our products. 
 We will need to effectively manage our operational, sales and marketing, development and other resources in order to successfully pursue our commercialization and research and development efforts for our existing and future products. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel.   If we are not successful in retaining and recruiting highly qualified personnel, our business may be harmed as a result. 
 We may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.
 Our business activities are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 Current legislation and future legislative or regulatory reform of the health care system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 In the United States, there have been, and we expect there to continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state government levels, to change the healthcare system in ways that, if approved, could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. While many of the proposed policy changes require congressional approval to implement, we cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third-party payor programs to health care providers will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement under these programs. Any changes that lower reimbursement rates under Medicare, Medicaid or private payor programs could negatively affect our business. 
 To the extent that any of our products are deemed to be durable medical equipment (“DME”), they may be subject to distribution under Medicare’s Competitive Acquisition regulations, which could adversely affect the amount that we can seek from payors. Non‑DME devices used in surgical procedures are normally paid directly by the hospital or health care provider and not reimbursed separately by third-party payors. As a result, these types of devices are subject to intense price competition that can place a small manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage as hospitals and health care providers attempt to negotiate lower prices for products such as the ones we develop and sell. 
 21


Most significantly, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the reconciliation law known as Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Reconciliation Act”, and, with the Affordable Care Act, the “2010 Health Care Reform Legislation”). Both Congressional leaders and President Trump have announced plans to repeal or modify the 2010 Health Care Reform Litigation.  At this time, the Company is not certain as to the impact of federal health care legislation on its business.   
 The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation subjects manufacturers of medical devices to an excise tax of 2.3% on certain U.S. sales of medical devices beginning in January 2013. This excise tax was suspended in December 2015 for two years, however, if eventually implemented, this excise tax will likely increase our expenses in the future. 
 Further, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation includes the Open Payments Act (formerly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act), which, in conjunction with its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of certain drugs, biologics, and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually certain payments or “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. We provided reports under the Open Payments Act to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The failure to report appropriate data accurately, timely, and completely could subject us to significant financial penalties. Other countries and several states currently have similar laws and more may enact similar legislation.
 We are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business. Any cost containment measures or other health care system reforms that are adopted could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our existing and future products successfully.
 Because our design, development and manufacturing capabilities are limited, we may rely on third parties to design, develop, manufacture or supply some of our products. An inability to find additional or alternate sources for these services and products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 We have used third-party design and development sources to assist in the design and development of our medical device products. In the future, we may choose to use additional third-party sources for the design and development of our products. If these design and development partners are unable to provide their services in the timeframe or to the performance level that we require, we may not be able to establish a contract and obtain a sufficient alternative supply from another supplier on a timely basis and in the manner that we require. 
 Our products require precise, high quality manufacturing. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with the quality systems regulations, current “good manufacturing practices” and other applicable government regulations and corresponding standards. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with QSR, we may experience manufacturing errors resulting in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery, delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. 
 Any performance failure by us or on the part of our design and development partners or contract manufacturers could delay product development or regulatory clearance or approval of our products, or commercialization of our products and future products, depriving us of potential product revenue and resulting in additional losses. In addition, our dependence on any third party for design, development or manufacturing could adversely affect our future profit margins. Our ability to replace any then-existing manufacturer may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and, in the case of Class III devices, the FDA must approve any replacement manufacturer before manufacturing can begin. It may be difficult or impossible for us to identify and engage a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all.
 We may become subject to potential product liability claims, and we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.
 Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the design, testing, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and each of our product candidates that we are seeking to introduce to the market. Surgical medical devices involve significant risks of serious complications, including bleeding, nerve injury, paralysis, infection, and even death. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or in our inability to secure coverage in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may have to pay the excess of this award out of our cash reserves, which could significantly harm our financial condition. If longer-term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component of a product 
 22


causes tissue damage, motor impairment or other adverse effects, we could be subject to significant liability. A product liability claim, even one without merit, could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees, and result in the diversion of management’s attention from managing our business.
 If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, our business could be materially harmed.
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop or license under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information. However, we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents required for us to commercialize our proposed products. We hold nine United States patents, three Italian patents, one Russian patent, a European patent, two Japanese patents, two Australian patents and a Chinese patent, and have more than forty patent applications filed in the United States and abroad.  Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents issue, such as applications filed prior to November 29, 2000, or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. For this and other reasons, we or our third-party collaborators may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing desired exclusivity. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we will not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities, unless we challenge the validity, enforceability or infringement of the third-party patent or otherwise circumvent the third-party patent.
 Our strategy depends on our ability to promptly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. In addition, we will rely on third-party collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly during certain collaborations. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming. If our present or future collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, our business will be adversely affected. Despite our efforts and the efforts of our collaborators to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to develop and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
 The issuance of a patent provides a presumption, but does not guarantee that it is valid. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged or potentially circumvented. Moreover, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications. Any such challenge to our patents or patent applications would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, future court decisions may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of any patent, including those owned by medical device companies. 
 Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The patent position of medical device companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the USPTO and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in medical device patents. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, the enforceability or scope of our owned or licensed patents in the United States or in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. We may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection for our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties.
 We cannot assure you that any patents that will issue, that may issue or that may be licensed to us will be enforceable or valid or will not expire prior to the commercialization of our products, thus allowing others to more effectively compete with us. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not adequately protect our future products.
 For our Senhance System, we rely on our license from the European Union, and any loss of our rights under such license agreement, or failure to properly prosecute, maintain or enforce the patent applications underlying such license agreement, could materially adversely affect our business prospects for the Senhance System.
 Some of the patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio related to the Senhance System are licensed to TransEnterix Italia under a license agreement with the European Union. Presently, we rely on such licensed technology for our Senhance System products and may license additional technology from the European Union or other third parties in the future. The EU license agreement gives us rights for the commercial exploitation of the licensed patents, patent applications and know-how, subject to certain provisions of the license agreement. Failure to comply with these provisions could result in the loss of our rights under the EU license agreement. Our inability to rely on these patents and patent applications which are the basis of certain aspects of our Senhance System technology would have an adverse effect on our business. 
 23


Further, our success will depend in part on the ability of us, the European Union and other third-party licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property and, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. We, the European Union or other third-party licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which are licensed to us, may fail to maintain these patents, and may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than necessary to obtain an acceptable outcome from any such litigation. Without protection for the intellectual property we have licensed, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and results of operations.
 If we or our licensors are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, know-how and confidential and proprietary information. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we will seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual’s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with employees also generally provide and will generally provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. However, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise between us and those third parties as to the rights in related inventions. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 Other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale or import products or impair our competitive position. In addition, to the extent that a third party develops new technology that covers our products, we may be required to obtain licenses to that technology, which licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we will not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities, unless we challenge the validity, enforceability or infringement of the third-party patent or circumvent the third-party patent, which would be costly and would require significant time and attention of our management. Third parties may have or obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing products using our technology. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we require may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 If we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights, we could incur substantial costs and expenses, substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, business prospects and results of operations.
 Third parties may sue us for infringing their patent rights. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights of others. In addition, a third party may claim that we have improperly obtained or used its confidential or proprietary information. Furthermore, in connection with our third-party license agreements, we generally have agreed to indemnify the licensor for costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to intellectual property rights. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our management’s efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations. 
 If any parties successfully claim that our creation or use of proprietary technologies infringes upon their intellectual property rights, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties’ patent rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, a court could require us to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.

Our stockholders have experienced dilution of their percentage ownership of our stock and may experience additional dilution in the future.
 We have raised significant capital through the issuance of our common stock and will need to raise substantial additional capital in order to continue our operations and achieve our business objectives. The future issuance of the Company’s equity securities will further dilute the ownership of our outstanding common stock.   The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.
 Sales by stockholders of substantial amounts of our shares of common stock, the issuance of new shares of common stock by us or the perception that these sales may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
 As of December 31, 2016, our directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 38% of our outstanding voting securities. As a result, if some or all of them acted together, they would have the ability to exert substantial influence over the election of our board of directors and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company that may be favored by other stockholders. This could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.
 We have been named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit with claims of violations of the federal securities laws.   
 We have been named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging claims under the federal securities laws.  See the description in Item 3 below.  Based on the limited nature of the plaintiff’s allegations, the stage of the proceedings, and because significant legal issues have yet to be raised or decided, we have determined that the amount of any possible loss or range of possible loss in connection with this matter is not reasonably estimable.  Our management believes the alleged claims are without merit, but if we are not successful in our defense of this action, we could be liable for significant damages.  The class action lawsuit may also divert our attention from our ordinary business operations, and we may incur expenses associated with the defense.  Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of the matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and, consequently, could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
