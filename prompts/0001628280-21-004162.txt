Item 1. Business. 
Overview
Cerecor Inc. (the “Company”, “Cerecor” or “we”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on becoming a leader in development and commercialization of treatments for rare and orphan diseases. The Company is advancing its clinical-stage pipeline of innovative therapies that address unmet patient needs within rare and orphan diseases.
The Company's rare disease pipeline includes CERC-801, CERC-802 and CERC-803 (“CERC-800 compounds”), which are in development for therapies for congenital disorders of glycosylation and CERC-006, an oral mTORC1/2 inhibitor in development for the treatment of complex lymphatic malformations. The Company is also developing two monoclonal antibodies, CERC-002 and CERC-007. CERC-002 targets the cytokine LIGHT (TNFSF14) and is in clinical development for the treatment of severe pediatric-onset Crohn's disease and COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”). CERC-007 targets the cytokine IL-18 and is in clinical development for the treatment of Still’s disease (adult-onset Still’s disease (“AOSD”) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (“sJIA”)) and multiple myeloma (“MM”). CERC-006, 801, 802 and 803 have all received Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (“RPDD”), which makes all four eligible for a priority review voucher (“PRV”) upon approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). 
On February 3, 2020, the Company consummated its merger with Aevi Genomic Medicine, Inc. (“Aevi”), in which Cerecor acquired the rights to CERC-002, CERC-006 and CERC-007 (the “Aevi Merger”). Cerecor also entered into an employment agreement with Aevi's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Cola, for him to serve as Cerecor's Chief Executive Officer and an employment agreement with Aevi's Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Garry Neil, for him to serve as Cerecor's Chief Medical Officer (shortly thereafter promoted to Chief Scientific Officer). Additionally, Mr. Cola and Dr. Sol Barer, the former Chairman of the Board of Aevi, were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors. Dr. Barer serves as the Chairman of the Company’s Board.
The Company continues to explore strategic alternatives for its non-core assets, including its commercialized product, Millipred®, an oral prednisolone indicated across a wide variety of inflammatory conditions, and its neurology pipeline assets.
Recent Developments
Research and Development
In February 2021, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation (“FTD”) to CERC-803 for the treatment of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II (“LAD-II”, also known as SLC35C1-CDG). FTD is granted to drugs being developed for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions where there is an unmet medical need. The purpose of the provision is to help facilitate development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously. Specifically, FTD features actions to expedite the development and review, including the eligibility of a rolling review by the FDA.
On March 1, 2021, we announced final efficacy data including 60 day mortality from our exploratory Phase 2 U.S.-based, multi-center (10 sites), placebo-controlled proof of concept trial (NCT04412057) of the human anti-LIGHT (TNFSF14) monoclonal antibody CERC-002 in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. All patients in this trial were hospitalized with COVID-19-associated pneumonia and mild-to-moderate ARDS. A total of 83 patients (82 treated) were randomized 1:1 to receive the standard of care at the sites plus either a single dose of 1,200 mg of CERC-002 or placebo subcutaneously. Due to the protocol allowing patients to receive high flow oxygen prior to randomization, 62 patients were included in the intention-to-treat (“ITT”) analysis of the primary endpoint. The final analysis demonstrated the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint (proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure over the 28-day study period) compared to placebo in COVID-19 patients with ARDS treated with a single dose of the anti-LIGHT monoclonal antibody CERC-002 (n=62, p=0.044). Efficacy was highest in a prespecified subpopulation of patients over the age of 60 (n=34, OR = 3.38, p=0.042). CERC-002 showed statistically significant efficacy on top of corticosteroids and standard of care treatments in COVID-19 ARDS: over 90% of patients received concomitant systemic corticosteroids and >60% received remdesivir. CERC-002 was well-tolerated. No drug-related serious adverse effects (“SAEs”) were reported in the trial, and there was no increase in infections in CERC-002 treated patients. 
In December 2020, we announced that the Company dosed its first patient in a Phase 1b clinical trial of CERC-007 to treat relapsed or refractory MM. We also announced that the FDA accepted the Company’s Investigational New Drug 
Applications as active to study the uses of: CERC-007 to treat relapsed or refractory MM; CERC-007 to treat Still’s disease (including AOSD and sJIA); and CERC-803 to treat LAD-II.
In November 2020, we announced a collaboration with The Frontiers in Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation Consortium on a prospective pivotal trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of CERC-801 in patients suffering from Phosphoglucomutase-1 deficiency related congenital disorders of glycosylation (“PGM1-CDG”).
New Leadership Appointment
On March 1, 2021, the Company appointed Schond L. Greenway as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Greenway brings over 20 years of investment banking, finance and corporate advisory experience in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. The Company believes Mr. Greenway will provide valuable insights and guidance as the Company anticipates several significant near-term milestones and continues to transform into a leader in development and commercialization of treatments for rare and orphan diseases.

Pipeline Assets— Overview, Competition and Intellectual Property
Clinical-Stage Pipeline
The following chart summarizes key information about our clinical-stage pipeline and is followed by further detail for each program, including an overview, competition, licenses (if applicable), and intellectual property:
CERC-002: Anti-LIGHT monoclonal antibody for treatment of COVID-19 ARDS and Severe Pediatric-onset Crohn's Disease.
•Overview: CERC-002 is a fully human anti-LIGHT or tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14 (“TNFSF14”) monoclonal antibody. It is the only clinical stage anti-LIGHT therapy and has the potential to treat a number of LIGHT-associated immune diseases. It is currently in development for cytokine storm induced COVID-19 ARDS and pediatric onset Crohn’s disease. 
•Role of LIGHT in Acute Inflammatory Response: LIGHT (homologous to Lymphotoxin, exhibits inducible expression and competes with HSV glycoprotein D for binding to herpesvirus entry mediator, a receptor expressed on T lymphocytes) is a cytokine with inflammatory actions encoded by the TNFSF14 gene. LIGHT plays an important role in regulating immune responses in the lung, gut and skin. It stimulates T Cell and B Cell response as well as induces the release of other cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF and GM-CSF. It thus plays a key role in immune responses to viral pneumonia and other diseases.
•About COVID-19 ARDS: ARDS is a severe inflammatory disease of the lungs caused by a build up of excess fluid in the alveoli of the lungs. ARDS is a condition most commonly associated with illnesses such as sepsis, trauma, viral and bacterial pneumonia. Current literature suggests that COVID-19 usually begins as an upper respiratory tract infection; however, for some patients, the COVID-19 virus enters the lower respiratory tract and causes direct injury to the lungs by filling the alveoli with excess fluid. Often times, as decrease in oxygenation occurs in the blood, breathing becomes distressed and organs become oxygen-deficient. The lungs attempt to heal, but the resulting inflammatory response often ends up damaging the lungs further. When a patient presents with symptoms associated with ARDS—shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid heart rate and reduced blood oxygen levels—they may be transported to the intensive care unit to be monitored and possibly treated with artificial or mechanical ventilation.
•About Pediatric-onset Crohn's Disease: Pediatric-onset Crohn’s disease is a rare, inflammatory bowel disease characterized by severe, chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall or any portion of the gastrointestinal tract. In pediatric Crohn’s disease, the immune system responds to a stimulus, often an infection, but the response is abnormal. The immune system mistakenly targets the gastrointestinal system. This sustained and abnormal immune system 
activity causes chronic inflammation and irritation of the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the signs and symptoms of pediatric Crohn’s disease. Pediatric-onset Crohn's disease has a more aggressive phenotype than the adult-onset disease. 
•Competition: 
–COVID-19 ARDS: While there have been anti-viral and steroid medications utilized as standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19 (including dexamethasone and baracitinib), only one therapeutic (remdesivir) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVD-19. Further, the United States has issued multiple Emergency Use Authorizations (“EUAs”) for COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccines have also been authorized or approved in other countries around the world. Vaccine distribution is ongoing and additional vaccine candidates are in development. The broad distribution of COVID-19 vaccines may reduce demand for our COVID-19 ARDS treatment. 
–Pediatric-onset Crohn’s Disease: There are numerous options available for the stepwise treatment of pediatric-onset Crohn’s disease. Patients with mild or moderate disease may be treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid (“5-ASA”) and/or antibiotics. Additionally, children with moderate or severe disease may be treated with corticosteroids. Immunomodulators, including 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, and methotrexate, may be used to induce or prolong remissions from Crohn’s disease. Biologics, such as infliximab and adalimumab, may also be used to treat pediatric-onset Crohn’s disease. 
•License: In May 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Clinical Development and Option Agreement with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (“KKC”), which replaced that certain 2016 Development and Option Agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired certain rights with respect to the development and potential commercialization of CERC-002 in specified indications, which are discussed below.
–ARDS: Cerecor was granted the right to conduct a signal finding study testing CERC-002 in the treatment of COVID-19 ARDS. Additionally, Cerecor was granted an additional option (the “ARDS Option”) separate from the above to obtain exclusive rights for the development, manufacture and commercialization of CERC-002 in the treatment, prevention, and diagnosis of acute lung injury and ARDS (collectively, the “ARDS/ALI Field”). 
If Cerecor exercises the ARDS Option, Cerecor will have the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize CERC-002 globally in the ARDS/ALI Field pursuant to a pre-agreed license agreement. Cerecor will be responsible for manufacturing for use in clinical trials as well as for commercialization in the ARDS/ALI Field. Upon exercise of the ARDS Option, Cerecor will be required to pay KKC an initial license fee in the low single-digit millions of dollars. The Company may pay KKC up to an additional $14 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones related to CERC-002 in the ARDS/ALI Field. Cerecor and KKC will split profits from the Company’s sales of CERC-002 in the ARDS/ALI Field with the Company being entitled to 74% of such profits and KKC being entitled to 26% of such profits. KKC will pay the Company low double-digit royalties for sales of CERC-002 outside the ARDS/ALI Field. The Company will be responsible for costs of development of CERC-002 in the ARDS/ALI Field. KKC will have the right to purchase CERC-002 from Cerecor for use outside the ARDS/ALI Field. 
–Specified pediatric onset rare and orphan inflammatory diseases (including severe pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis and other specified pediatric onset rare and orphan auto-immune diseases): If Cerecor exercises its option, KKC may select one of two development and commercialization structures as follows:
▪Plan A: Co‑Development/Co‑Commercialization Arrangement- If KKC selects the co‑development/co‑commercialization arrangement (Plan A), Cerecor will have the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Antibody Licensed Products in the treatment, prevention, and diagnosis of specified pediatric onset rare and orphan inflammatory diseases (including severe pediatric onset inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, or IBD) and other specified pediatric onset rare and orphan auto‑immune diseases, or collectively, the Field, in the United States and Canada. Cerecor will also be responsible for development and regulatory approval of the first Antibody Licensed Product in the European Union and then transferring such regulatory approval to KKC or its designee. Cerecor will be responsible for the manufacture of the Antibody Licensed Products for use by the parties in clinical trials as well as for commercialization in their respective fields and/or territories, with KKC purchasing the Antibody Licensed Products from Cerecor.
Cerecor will be required to pay KKC an initial license fee in the low single‑digit millions of dollars upon the co‑development/co‑commercialization arrangement becoming effective. Cerecor may pay KKC up to an additional $18 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones related to the Antibody Licensed Products. The parties will share the anticipated costs of development of the first Antibody Licensed Product in the Field in the United States, Canada and the European Union with Cerecor being responsible for any costs in excess of an agreed cap. The parties will split profits from Cerecor’s sales of Antibody Licensed Products in the United States and Canada equally. KKC will pay Cerecor low double‑digit royalties for sales of Antibody Licensed Products outside the United States and Canada and outside the Field in the United States and Canada.
▪Plan B: Licensing Arrangement- If KKC selects the licensing arrangement (Plan B), Cerecor will have the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Antibody Licensed Products in the Field in the United States, Canada and the European Union. Cerecor will be responsible for the manufacture of the Antibody Licensed Products for use by the parties in clinical trials as well as for commercialization in their respective fields and/or territories.
Cerecor will be required to pay KKC an initial license fee in the low single‑digit millions of dollars upon the licensing arrangement becoming effective. Cerecor may pay KKC up to an additional $28 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones related to the Antibody Licensed Products. The parties will split profits from Cerecor’s sales of Antibody Licensed Products in the United States, Canada and the European Union with Cerecor being entitled to 74% of such profits and KKC being entitled to 26% of such profits. KKC will pay Cerecor low double‑digit royalties for sales of Antibody Licensed Products outside the United States, Canada and the European Union and outside the Field in the United States, Canada and the European Union. Cerecor will be responsible for costs of development of Licensed Products in the United States, Canada and the European Union. KKC will have the right to purchase the Antibody Licensed Products from Cerecor. 
•Intellectual Property: At a minimum, we plan to rely on patent protection in all major jurisdictions (including the United States) through the patent's expiration in 2027.  Additionally, if we receive marketing approval, we expect to receive biologics data exclusivity in the United States, which may provide twelve years of marketing exclusivity in the United States. 
CERC-007: Anti-IL-18 Monoclonal antibody for treatment of Still’s disease and MM.
•Overview: CERC-007 is a high affinity, fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18. We are developing CERC-007 for the treatment of multiple auto-immune diseases, including Still’s disease (AOSD and sJIA), and MM.
•About Still’s disease: Still's disease is a serious and rare auto-inflammatory disorder that affects the entire body. AOSD refers to Still’s disease in adult patients, while sJIA refers to Still’s disease in pediatric patients. AOSD and sJIA share common clinical manifestations, including episodes of high, spiking fevers, rash, joint pain, muscle pain, sore throat, multiorgan involvement and elevated levels of IL-18.
•About MM: MM is a blood cancer characterized by an excess proliferation of plasma cells.
•Competition:
–Still’s Disease: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids and methotrexate may be used in the initial treatment of Still’s disease. Ilaris® (canakinumab) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of sJIA and AOSD in the United States. Additionally, Ilaris® and Kineret® (anakinra) have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of Still’s Disease in the European Union. 
–MM: There are currently numerous therapeutic agents approved for the treatment of MM. MM is often treated with at least one of the three main classes of agents, utilized in combination across all lines of therapy: (i) immunomodulators, which include Revlimid® and Pomalyst®, (ii) proteosome inhibitors, which include Velcade® and Kyprolis®, and (iii) anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, which include Darzalex® and Sarclisa®. 
•License: The Company has an exclusive global license to develop and commercialize a Phase 2-ready fully human, anti-IL-18 monoclonal antibody (which we refer to as CERC-007) from Medimmune Limited, a subsidiary of 
AstraZeneca plc (“AstraZeneca”). Up to $162 million may be due to AstraZeneca upon achievement of certain development and sales‑related milestones, in addition to tiered low double‑digit royalties on global annual product sales. Cerecor is fully responsible for the development and commercialization of the program. 
•Intellectual Property: CERC-007 is eligible to receive ODD for the treatment of MM and ODD for the treatment of Still’s disease. Therefore, if we apply and are subsequently granted ODD in such indications, following market approval, we plan to rely on seven-year marketing exclusivity for each in the United States. Additionally, if we receive marketing approval, we expect to receive biologics data exclusivity in the United States, which may provide twelve years of marketing exclusivity in the United States. 
CERC-007 is also eligible to receive Orphan Designation (“OD”) in the European Union and we plan to apply for such designation for CERC-007 for the treatment of sJIA. Therefore, if we apply and are subsequently granted OD in the European Union, we plan to rely on ten-year marketing exclusivity in the European Union. 
CERC-006: Dual mTOR inhibitor for treatment of Complex Lymphatic Malformations.
•Overview: CERC-006 is an orally available inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 and 2 that is being developed for the treatment of patients with serious lymphatic malformations (“LM”) who are not eligible for surgery or sclerotherapy. Because a large majority of LM patients have activating mutations in the PK/AKT/mTOR pathway, we believe CERC-006 has the potential to specifically reduce proliferation of the abnormal cells that cause LM, reduce the size of neoplastic lesions and restore lymphatic function; ultimately improving and prolonging the lives of many affected children.
•About Complex LM: Lymphatic malformations are rare, non-malignant masses consisting of fluid-filled channels or spaces thought to be caused by the abnormal development of the lymphatic system. LM occurs mostly in infancy or early childhood and can persist throughout life.
•Designations of CERC-006: 
–ODD; the benefit of which, amongst other things, is a seven-year marketing exclusivity (upon approval) in the United States; and
–RPDD, which provides eligibility for a PRV upon FDA approval. If received, the PRV, which may be sold and transferred an unlimited amount of times, can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent new drug application (“NDA”) or biologics license application (“BLA”).
•Competition: There are currently no FDA approved drug therapies for LM. Existing therapeutic options for treatment of LM include percutaneous drainage, surgery, sclerotherapy, laser therapy, radiofrequency ablation, or medical therapy. 
•License: The Company has an exclusive license agreement with OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, an indirect wholly, owned subsidiary of Astellas Pharma, Inc. (“Astellas”), for the worldwide development and commercialization of the novel, second generation mTORC1/2 inhibitor, which we refer to as CERC‑006. Under the terms of the license agreement, we paid Astellas an up-front license fee of $0.5 million and Astellas will be eligible to receive milestone payments up to $5.5 million based upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. Upon commercialization, Astellas will be entitled to a tiered, single‑digit royalty on worldwide annual net sales. Cerecor is fully responsible for the development and commercialization of the program. 
•Royalty: Prior to Cerecor entering into the merger agreement with Aevi, in July 2019, Aevi entered into a royalty agreement with certain investors, including Mike Cola, its then Chief Executive Officer, and an entity on behalf of Dr. Garry Neil, its then Chief Scientific Officer, in exchange for a one-time aggregate payment of $2 million (the “Royalty Agreement”), which was approved by a majority of the independent members of the board of directors and the audit committee of Aevi. We assumed this Royalty Agreement upon closing of the Aevi Merger. Under the terms of such Royalty Agreement, the investors will be entitled to an aggregate amount equal to a low-single digit percentage of the aggregate net sales of CERC-006. At any time beginning three years after the date of the first public launch of CERC-006, we may exercise, at our sole discretion, a buyout option that terminates any further obligations under the Royalty Agreement in exchange for a payment to such investors of an aggregate of 75% of the net present value of the royalty payments. 
•Intellectual Property: CERC-006 has received ODD from the FDA. As a result, at a minimum, following marketing approval, we plan to rely on seven-year marketing exclusivity in the United States. 
CERC-800 Programs: Monosaccharide therapies for treatment of select Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation.
•Overview: CERC-801, CERC-802 and CERC-803 are monosaccharide therapies with known therapeutic utility for the treatment of select congenital disorders of glycosylation (“CDGs”). Oral administration of CERC-801, CERC-802, and CERC-803 replenishes critical metabolic intermediates that are reduced or absent due to genetic mutations, overcoming single enzyme defects in respective CDGs to support glycoprotein synthesis, maintenance and function. 
CERC-801 is a D-galactose substrate replacement therapy for the treatment of phosphoglucomutase 1 (“PGM1”) deficiency, also known as PGM1-CDG. CERC-802 is a D-mannose substrate replacement therapy for the treatment of Mannose Phosphate Isomerase (“MPI”) deficiency, also known as MPI-CDG. CERC-803 is a L-fucose substrate replacement therapy for the treatment of LADII, also known as SLC35C1-CDG.
•About CDGs: CDGs are a group of rare, inherited, metabolic disorders caused by glycosylation defects that present as a broad range of clinical symptoms, including coagulopathy, hepatopathy, myopathy, hypoglycemia, protein-losing enteropathy and reduced cell counts. CDG patients are born with a genetic defect that hinders their ability to utilize certain monosaccharides in the production of glycoproteins. A deletion or misplacement of a sugar subunit produces a dysfunctional glycoprotein, resulting in a myriad of medical issues. 
•Designations of CERC-800 Compounds: 
–ODD; the benefit of which, amongst other things, is a seven-year marketing exclusivity (upon approval) in the United States;
–RPDD, which provides eligibility for a PRV upon FDA approval of each compound. If received, each PRV, which may be sold and transferred an unlimited amount of times, can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent NDA or BLA; and
–FTD, which features actions to expedite the development of drugs that target serious or life-threatening conditions, including eligibility for expedited review and rolling review of each NDA by the FDA.
The below chart depicts the potential benefits associated with ODD and RPDD for each of the CERC-800 compounds upon marketing approval and anticipated timing of pivotal data: 
•Competition: Currently there are no FDA approved treatments for the treatment of CDGs (including PGM1-CDG, MPI-CDG or LADII), however dietary monosaccharide formulations have been shown to alleviate several of the clinical manifestations in CDG patients.
CERC‑801, CERC‑802 and CERC‑803, are ultra‑pure formulations of D‑galactose, D‑mannose and L‑fucose, respectively. These formulations are naturally occurring substances contained in various foods, including dairy products and fruit. Additionally, D-galactose and D‑mannose are also marketed by others as non‑prescription dietary supplements. 
•Intellectual Property: The CERC-800 compounds each were granted ODD by the FDA. As a result, at a minimum, following marketing approval, we plan to rely on seven-year marketing exclusivity in the United States. 
Intellectual Property Overview
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for the technology and know-how upon which our products are based, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.

We hold ownership, trademark rights and/or exclusivity to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates covered by patents and patent applications. Our portfolio of patents includes patents or patent applications with claims directed to compositions of matter, including compounds, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, methods of manufacturing the compounds, or a combination of these claims. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of a compound for a specific indication, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar extensions to patent term may be available in other countries for particular patents in Cerecor’s portfolio. 
The Company has a license agreement (“License Agreement”) and a sponsored research agreement (“Research Agreement”) with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (“CHOP”). Under the terms of the License Agreement, the Company has an (i) an exclusive, sublicensable license to use certain patent rights covering potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and (ii) an exclusive, non‑sublicensable license to use certain biospecimen and phenotypic data collected from patients with rare and orphan diseases and their family members, which terminates as of June 30, 2021 but can be extended for up to two additional one year periods subject to certain conditions specified therein.
We plan to augment our portfolio of compounds by focusing on the development (when possible) of new chemical entities (“NCEs”), which have not previously received FDA approval. Upon approval by the FDA, NCEs are entitled to market and data exclusivity in the United States with respect to generic drug competition for a period of five years from the date of FDA approval, even if the related patents have expired.
Intellectual Property for specific pipeline assets, if applicable, are discussed above within the “Product Pipeline Assets” section. 
Competition Overview
We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. We compete, or will compete, with existing and new products being developed by our competitors. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our research and development programs target.
Competition for specific pipeline assets are discussed above within the “Product Pipeline Assets” section. 
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce our drug candidates in accordance with applicable provisions of the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices regulations (“cGMP”) for use in our clinical studies. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control.
Sales and Marketing
For our clinical stage pipeline assets, we may retain or partner United States commercialization rights and develop sales and marketing capabilities when needed. We may complement our own sales force with co‑promotion agreements with partners in and outside the United States. We may also seek to commercialize any of our approved products outside of the United States and may do so either through an expansion of our sales force or through collaboration with third parties. 
Overall Competitive Climate and Risks
Other competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or may be awaiting FDA approval that could reach the market and become established before we have a product to sell. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small compound drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following:
•identifying and validating targets;
•screening compounds against targets;
•preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and
•obtaining FDA and other regulatory clearances.
In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas:
•capital resources;
•research and development resources; 
•manufacturing capabilities; and
•sales and marketing.
Smaller companies might also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, may succeed in developing technologies or drugs that are more effective, safer, and more affordable or more easily administered than ours and may achieve patent protection or commercialize drugs sooner than us. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.
For additional information on risks regarding our competition, refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export, pricing, and government contracting related to pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, or other actions, such as the FDA’s delay in review of or refusal to approve a pending NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or study termination, issuance of Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, mandated modifications to promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, requests for product recalls, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow product import or export, total or partial suspension of or restriction of or imposition of other requirements relating to production or distribution, injunctions, fines, debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, FDA debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.
FDA Marketing Approval
Obtaining FDA marketing approval for new products may take many years and require the expenditure of substantial financial resources. In order for FDA to determine that a product is safe and effective for the proposed indication, the product must first undergo testing in animals (nonclinical studies). The data generated from nonclinical studies is used to support the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application under which human studies are conducted. Human testing is generally conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application in three phases following GCP guidelines:
•Phase 1 studies evaluate the safety of the drug, generally in normal, healthy volunteers;
•Phase 2 studies evaluate safety and efficacy, as well as explore dosing ranges; these studies are typically conducted in patient volunteers who suffer from the particular disease condition that the drug is designed to treat; and
•Phase 3 studies evaluate safety and efficacy of the product at specific doses in one or more larger pivotal trials. 
In addition to human testing, the manufacturing process of the potential product must be developed in accordance with GMP regulations. Prior to the approval of a new product, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the proposed drug product is manufactured to ensure GMP compliance.
The cumulative safety and efficacy data generated from the clinical trials described above, chemistry, manufacturing and control (“CMC”) information, nonclinical study data and proposed labeling are used as the basis to support approval of a marketing application (NDA or BLA) to FDA. The preparation of an NDA or BLA requires the expenditure of substantial funds and the commitment of substantial resources. Additionally, in most cases, the submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee paid at the time of submission. The FDA conducts a preliminary administrative review upon receipt of the NDA or BLA submission. The FDA then either accepts the NDA or BLA for filing and commences its technical review or it refuses to accept the filing with the filer then having to address the deficiencies cited by the FDA and re-file the NDA or BLA again. 
After evaluating the NDA or BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has a review goal of completing its review of 90% of resubmissions within two or six months after receipt, depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
The development and approval of new drugs requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Data obtained from the development program are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations. These instances may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. 
FDA Post‑Approval Considerations 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages. During the approval process, FDA and the sponsor may agree that specific studies or clinical trials should be conducted as post-marketing commitments, but they are not required. The FDA may also impose post-marketing requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product becomes available in the market.
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as manufacturing changes and adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Additionally, the FDA strictly regulates the labeling, advertising and promotion of products under an approved NDA or BLA. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs debarment from government contracts, refusal of future orders under existing contracts and mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements.
Emergency Use Authorization
The FDA has the authority to grant an EUA to allow marketing and sale of unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products in response to an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, such as COVID-19, when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. When issuing an EUA, the FDA imposes conditions of authorization, with which the company must comply. Such conditions include, but may not be limited to, compliance with labeling, distribution of materials designed to ensure proper use, reporting obligations, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. The EUA is only effective for the duration of the public health emergency, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA may revoke or terminate the EUA sooner if, for example, the company fails to comply with the conditions of authorization of the EUA or the drug is determined to be less effective or safe than it was initially believed to be.
Other Regulations of the Healthcare Industry
In addition to FDA regulations governing the marketing of pharmaceutical products, there are various other state and federal laws that may restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These include the following:
•The federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback laws, which prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
•Other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment;
•The federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government;
•The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials;
•State and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; 
•The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which among other things changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries; changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure; 
•The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which creates federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and which also imposes certain obligations on entities with respect to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
•The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the payment data.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
        To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. This is currently not applicable as none of our products are currently sold in a foreign country.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third‑party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our therapeutic product candidates. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third‑party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage, attempting to limit reimbursement levels or regulate the price of drugs and other medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative 
products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. Moreover, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and other governmental payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies.
In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third‑party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. 
In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of AMP, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. 
On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to exercise existing authorities to reduce burdens associated with the Affordable Care Act pending further action by Congress. In October 2017, he signed an Executive Order which directed federal agencies to modify how the Affordable Care Act is implemented. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “IRC”), as amended, commonly referred to as the individual mandate. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further legislative and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the new Administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he intends to use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the Trump administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry. 
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court which heard oral arguments in the case on November 10, 2020. A ruling is expected in 2021.
The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “BBA”), among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” by increasing from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D.
The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. As noted above, the 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. 
Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
Hatch‑Waxman Patent Exclusivity
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA in the product application concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
•the required patent information has not been filed;
•the listed patent has expired;
•the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
•the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.
Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent or if the listed patent is a patented method of use for which approval is not being sought. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the 
Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant or other period determined by a court.
Hatch‑Waxman Non‑Patent Exclusivity
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five‑year period of non‑patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non‑infringement.
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three‑year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Approval of Biosimilars and Biologic Exclusivity
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be "biosimilar" or "interchangeable" with an FDA-licensed reference biological product via an approved BLA. Biosimilarity to an approved reference product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity is demonstrated in steps beginning with rigorous analytical studies or "fingerprinting", in vitro studies, in vivo animal studies, and generally at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The biosimilarity exercise tests the hypothesis that the investigational product and the reference product are the same. If at any point in the stepwise biosimilarity process a significant difference is observed, then the products are not biosimilar, and the product will have to developed and approved using a traditional NDA or BLA. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. 
Upon approval of a BLA, the biologic is listed in the Purple Book along with the date it was licensed; whether the biological product licensed has been determined by the FDA to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference biological product (an already-licensed FDA biological product) and the date of expiration of applicable exclusivity. Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. This 12 year period includes 4 years before the FDA may accept for filing an application for a biologic that references a branded (reference) product.
Pediatric Exclusivity.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent exclusivity period described above. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity. 
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States will be recovered from United States sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a drug already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same drug as the already approved drug. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user‑fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is generally entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation
Under Section 529 to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), the FDA will award priority review vouchers to sponsors of rare pediatric disease product applications that meet certain criteria. Under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a rare pediatric disease" may qualify for a PRV that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The PRV may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Under the PRV program, any drug that is granted RPDD by September 30, 2024 and receives approval by September 20, 2026 may qualify for a PRV.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding drug development and commercialization. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
European Union Drug Approval Process
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications (“MAAs”) either under the so‑called centralized or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) that is valid in all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"). Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop‑clocks.
National authorization procedures
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten‑year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Commercially Marketed Product
The Company currently has one marketed product, Millipred®, an oral prednisolone indicated across a wide variety of inflammatory conditions and indications. Prednisolone is a man-made form of a natural substance (corticosteroid hormone) made by the adrenal gland. It is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood disorders, immune system disorders, skin and eye conditions, respiratory disorders, cancer, and severe allergies. Prednisolone decreases an individual's immune response to various diseases to reduce symptoms such as pain, swelling and allergic-type reactions. Millipred® is supplied in 5mg tablets.

Millipred® tablets primarily compete in the generic prednisolone market. We believe our primary point of differentiation is that we offer the lowest strength prednisolone in the marketplace allowing healthcare professionals greater flexibility when dosing a glucocorticoid steroid across a variety of pediatric and adult indications. Additionally, Millipred® utilizes the proprietary double taste-masking technology to provide a pleasant grape taste with no bitterness, which makes the product easier to administer to children. 
Prior to selling our rights, titles and interest in, assets relating to its Pediatric Portfolio, namely Aciphex® Sprinkle™, Cefaclor for Oral Suspension, Karbinal™ ER, Flexichamber™ , Poly-Vi-Flor® and Tri-Vi-Flor™ (the “Pediatric Portfolio”) as well as the corresponding commercial infrastructure consisting of the right to offer employment to Cerecor’s sales force and the assignment of supporting commercial contracts (the “Aytu Divestiture”) to Aytu BioScience, Inc. (“Aytu”) in the fourth quarter of 2019, we promoted our commercially marketed products, which included Millipred®, through a sales force of territory managers. As part of the Aytu Divestiture, Cerecor terminated all sales force personnel. Cerecor entered into a transition services agreement with Aytu in which Aytu will manage the commercial operations of Millipred®  for a monthly fee of $12,000 for up to 18 months (post November 1, 2019) or until the Company establishes an independent commercial infrastructure for the product or the Company executes on strategic alternatives for the product. 
Employees and Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had 32 employees, thirty of whom are full-time, one of whom is part-time and nineteen of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, and an employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. We value diversity and inclusiveness at all levels.
