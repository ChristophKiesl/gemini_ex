All dollar amounts refer to US dollars unless otherwise indicated.

We were incorporated on February 16, 2017 in the State of Nevada. In addition to the US administrative office, the company currently has several offices with 20 full-time employees located in Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong. We were initially a travel agency that organized individual and group tours in the Dominican Republic, such as cultural, recreational, sport, business, ecotours and other travel tours. Yoel Rosario Duran was the initial Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, and Board Director. Dmitriy Perfilyev was the initial the Secretary of the Company

On December 27, 2018, Honetech Inc., a Samoa company, purchased 9,999,200 (post-forward split) shares of common stock of VIVIC Corp. from Yoel Rosario Duran for the price of $189,984.80, and 7,999,200 (post-forward split) shares of common stock of VIVIC Corp. from Dmitriy Perfilyev for the price of $151,984.80 pursuant to the share purchase agreements entered on December 21, 2018. Upon the consummation of those transactions, Honetech Inc. became the controlling shareholder of VIVIC Corp. Yoel Rosario Duran resigned from all positions he held in the Company, including Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, and Board Director. Dmitriy Perfilyev resigned as the Secretary of the Company。At the same time, we appointed Wen-Chi Huang, Kuen-Horng Tsai, Cheng-Hsing Hsu and Huilan Chen as directors, and also appointed Yun-Kuang Kung as CEO.

On November 1, 2019, Liu-Shiang Kung Hwang was appointed as a Board Director. 

On July 9, 2020, Wen-Chi Huang, Kuen-Horng Tsai, Yun-Kuang Kung, Hwang Liu-Shiang Kung and Huilan Chen no longer served as the board directors and officers of the Company. Shang-Chiai Kung was appointed as the Chairman of the Board, Board Director, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Starting December 27, 2018 with the change of management, we expanded our business operations to include the operation of marine tourism in China, Taiwan and South East Asia. We also started to engage in the construction of marina and yachts in China under the brand name Monte Fino after we have acquired Khashing Yachts Industry (Guangdong) Limited (formerly known as Guangzhou Monte Fino Yacht Co., Ltd.), a Chinese limited liability company in October 2019. Khashing Yachts Industry (Guangdong) Limited has conducted business in several Chinese provinces, including Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan. Khashing Yachts Industry (Guangdong) Limited holds the exclusive license to use the Kha Shings brand Monte Fino in the mainland China.

It is in the process of applying for licenses to develop a yacht marina in Shanwei City, Guangdong Province, China, as well as in Fujian Province, China. 

In association with our marine tourism business, we developed and operated an online platform named Joy Wave(享浪) to provide yacht time-share, rental and charter services to the customers in many famous coastal tourism attractions in Taiwan and China including Hainan, Guangdong, Xiamen, and Quanzhou.

In addition to the yacht and marina business operations, in August 2020, we officially developed our first all-electric boat prototype after much research and development in partnership with Kha Shing Enterprise Co., the largest and most advanced yacht and boat building company in Taiwan. 

Regarding our consulting services, we help customers compare prices and purchase products by acting as an intermediary for their purchase and sales transactions. We also help customers obtain patents, implement product launch plans, and evaluate products.

Through our assistance, some customers have sold yachts while others have started marina development plans in Taiwan and China. However, starting from the beginning of 2020, the customers businesses have been impacted due to COVID-19, so our service revenue was also significantly reduced.

Before the acquisition of Khashing Yachts Industry (Guangdong) Limited (formerly known as Guangzhou Monte Fino Yacht Company Limited (MF)) by Vivic, MF had already approached the local governments in Quanzhou, Chongwu and Shanwei for licenses to develop marinas in the area. As a result, after the merger, the company continued to apply for marinas and land under the name of Vivic Corp. 

Even though MF's specialty is in marina management, the project includes a large amount of land development. These areas of land have a lower acquisition cost due to the government's incentive program and have increased value for its proximity to the marina, but real estate is not MFs strong suit. As such, MF will cooperate with real estate developers. Part of the profit is invested in the construction of the marinas. Importantly, the entire transaction process will be carried out in the name of MF, so profits will also be generated under the name of MF.

Consulting Services

We provide consulting services to other developers and operators of marinas. 

Our service includes following categories:

 Marketing Planning and Promotion: We assist marina operator clients to promote their products through marketing channels, help to build customer relationships and increase brand loyalty and awareness. We help clients to develop marketing plan and packaging procedure. We also help clients evaluate their business performance to effectively control their manpower and costs. Instead of paying on a percentage of the total transaction, our clients pay a fixed monthly fee for our service.

 Internet platform: We introduce clients to the internet platform and assist them with broadcasting their business to the platform. We use our experience and technology on the network platform to help our clients expand their customer base.

 Industry-University cooperation and research: Using customer feedback, we analyze possible future products and participate in professional technology transfer through industry R&D information collection and tracking, including marina developing, design and yacht manufacturing technology.

We have provided the consulting services to Kinmen Marina for our client-Everest Capital Corporation. We utilize our experiences in marina design and operation to conduct preliminary planning through on-site surveys, and utilize our local connections to help the client develop and construct the Kinmen Marina. At present, the preliminary project planning and market research for the Kinmen marina have been completed.

Currently the Company is planning and designing two other marinas for our client, the Anping yacht marina in Taiwan and the Zhongyunzhou yacht marina in Quanzhou, China. Both projects have undergone on-site surveys and commercial plans. 

Our Marina Projects:

We are currently developing three marina projects: Houzhu and Chongwu Marina, both in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province and Wenzhou Marina in Zhejiang Province, China.

We have conducted the preliminary research, feasibility analysis, government land negotiations, project design, and post-construction marina operation management plan. We need to obtain local government approval for the land use and the construction. Normally it takes between six months to a year to obtain such approval. However, due to the pandemic, we anticipate that it will take longer time to receive the permit.
Houzhu Yacht Marina (also name as Quanzhou Yacht Industrial Park)

Houzhu Yacht Marina is located in the urban area of Quanzhou City Providence in Fujian, China. This yacht marina, created by a French designer, is the core construction project of Quanzhou City. The project includes a complete yacht industrial park, yacht maintenance workshop, commercial area as well as a large high-end yacht club. The surrounding commercial shops have a land area of about 74 acres, a water area of about 32 acres, and 238 berths. After completing the application procedures and overall design, Houzhu Yacht Marina is currently in the stage of completing the land transfer and officially starting the construction.
 Our subsidiary-Khashing Yachts Industry (Guangdong) Limited (formerly known as Guangzhou Monte Fino (MF)) will lead the project of Quanzhou Houzhu Marina. We will carry out the business in the management and operation of marinas. It is planned that the first stage of establishment will be completed in 2021 and the entire project will be finished in 2022.

Chongwu Yacht Marina

Chongwu Town is a famous tourist area in Hui'an County, Quanzhou City on the southeast coast of Fujian Province, China. The entire Chongwu Town is a national 4A-level scenic site (the highest is 5A). Chongwu Yacht Marina project will include a resort hotel, a yacht club, water entertainment facilities, and a street filled with commercial stores along the seashore. Our Chinese subsidiaryKhashing Yachts Industry (Guangdong) Limited has signed the Quanzhou Chongwu Marina Project Investment Memorandum with the land owner, Quanzhou Gang Wu Group, on November 22, 2019. We are in the process of applying for government approval for land use and construction and we anticipate to receive it in the second half of 2021. We anticipate to complete in one year after the receipt of all approvals.
Wenzhou Yangfushan Yacht Marina

Wenzhou Yangfushan Marina is a project bid by the Company on November 30, 2020. Wenzhou Yangfushan Marina leasing contract (Exhibit No. 10.2). The marina will operate yacht chartering, wedding photography, marina advertising, sailing events, yacht training, yacht sales, electric boat bases, etc. At the same time, a membership system will be adopted at the marina, and members can enjoy various services by joining the membership.

The marina has 18 berths that can fit yachts up to 60 feet, and can provide temporary berths of 115 feet. At the same time, the marina also has a 2100 square feet office space that can be used for management and sailing training. There is also 21000 square feet next to the marina that can be rented for events.

Wenzhou marina will officially open in mid-2021, and a sailing competition will be held at the pier as one of the series of events for the marina grand opening.

Joy Wave Online Platform

Joy Wave Online Platform is a shared yacht online platform independently developed by us that can be used through social media apps. It can be used for chartering, yacht tourism booking, yacht purchasing, franchising, etc. Yacht owners can add their yachts onto Joy Wave for rental while customers can use the platform to book yachts. Because the program is only available through WeChat, Web pages and independent APP versions are currently being developed. Joy Wave is an important core product for the company to develop agents and manage yachts and marinas. After a marina is built, customers will pay the charter and parking fees through the platform and book marine tourism products. Moreover, features on the program allow for multiple users to crowdfund a yacht and register online as sales representatives of Vivic. Customers can also refer their friends if they have enjoyed their yacht rental experience with us. If the referred user then pays for the rental on the platform through the referral link, the referrer will receive a revenue share. This will accelerate the stream of new customers. At the same time, the owner can make profits by sharing his yacht whenever the owner desires.

Because "Joy Wave" uses the Internet to carry out business, the products can avoid the geographical limitations of past yacht marinas. People residing inland of China can learn about the joys of marine tourism and book yacht tours, which greatly benefits marine tourism and the market demographic.

Due to the travel restrictions caused by COVID-19 pandemic since January 2020, Chinese residents have turned to domestic yacht service providers for water recreational leisure. As the pandemic situation in China eases, the demands for yacht services have risen to the new height and it has become more difficult to make reservations for yacht charter services. To facilitate such demands, our Taiwan R&D team has been actively improving the Joy Wave online platform to allow Chinese customers to charter yachts online. The improved platform carries both B2C and B2B functions and allows individual and corporate customers to conveniently book yacht services at lower costs. 

All-Electric Boat and Yacht Products

In addition to the yacht and marina business operations, we officially launched a model of all-electric boat products in August 2020. Our R&D team has been developing all-electric ship technologies for several years and has finally reached the stage where our technologies are ready for the commercial production of all-electric boats and yachts. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, our crew and staff have been working around the clock to ensure the production line is ready for the manufacturing process. We have partnered with Kha Shing for the manufacturing of our all-electric boats and yachts as Kha Shing is a highly reputable and experienced yacht builder.

The standards of environmental protection have been increasing in recent decades. For example, The European Union and International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been implementing the new marine engine emission standards since 2008. The yachts with traditional diesel engines produce massive waste and lead to environmental pollution. Nowadays, the lithium battery with its clean energy is prevailing in the electric yachts industry. As they are eco-friendly, these liquified natural gas (LNG) yachts and electric yachts are the latest favorites in the market. Because electric yachts are made with zero-emission and low-noise level engines, they can easily meet energy-saving and emission control requirements. The trading volume of electric yachts increased tremendously in last decades. As yachts batteries and hybrid yachts become more advanced, the industry of electric yachts will continue its growth after 2020. We believe that eventually all-electric boats and yachts will completely replace their gasoline or diesel-powered counterparts, especially in the rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. The demand for the less polluting ships

in Taiwan, China, South East Asia, and Europe are particularly high as there are millions of gasoline or diesel-powered ships in use in these regions and have caused severe pollution to their waters.

However, one issue should be borne in mind that electric yachts replacing traditional diesel yachts is a continuing process. Both should be co-existed for a long time, like the motor vehicle with new-energy engine and the traditional one.

There are ginormous potential markets for electric yachts in the Asian countries including Japan, Taiwan, PRC, and the Middle East countries. There are 400,000 yachts and skiffs in Japan and mostly are fishing boats. The skiffs are equipped with battery electric or hybrid module for efficiency. Further, the buyers of small-sized yachts are more price-conscious. Electric yachts will cut the costs down. Japan has more potentials in product update in the future. The Asian countries, like Taiwan and PRC, and the Middle East countries are emerging markets of yachts. They are the right places for launching new products. For our marketing strategy, new products are used for capturing the new market share and increasing the existing market share.

For yacht marketing activities, the size of exhibitions reveals the tremendous potential in the Asian markets. The yacht exhibition Singapore is the largest one in Asia. Only 11 yachts participated in the yacht exhibition Singapore 2011. Favorably, approximate 100 exhibitors joined the same in 2019, more than 80 yachts participated and attracted over 16,000 people entered into it. The number of yachts participated in this exhibition approximately 8 times increased from the one in 2011. This reflects high growth rate in the Asian yacht markets.

There are different needs from different Asian yacht markets. The high-GDP groups in Hong Kong and PRC become the potential growth markets for yacht industry. However, there is great divergence among the Asian and Western customers regarding the yacht specifications. Asian markets focus on the size instead of the number of functional areas of yachts. It is because they normally cruise with short-distance in day time but not long-distance at night. Therefore, there are a lot of works to be accomplished for developing the markets. Catamarans are popular in the Asian countries because they provide more spacious areas with stable navigation. They are also able to access to the shallow water for more fun.

The features of our electric yachts are:

 Reduces the emission and meets the environmental protection requirement for operation in rivers and lakes
  Reduces operating and maintenance costs
  The use of electric transmission instead of mechanical transmission reduces or even eliminates the need for gearboxes and drive shafts and saves a lot of space.
  Provides for a more flexible engine placement, improved engine room layout, and a convenient installation and maintenance of the engine
  The acoustic decoupling between the engine and the hull reduces noise, weight, and volume
  Offers a wide range of speeds, a more powerful driving force, and an easy handling
  Provides a tidy working area and significantly improved operating comfort

The electric yachts are eco-friendly while cutting the costs down significantly. The noise and vibration level of the electric engine is also improved from the traditional yacht. Electric yachts are well equipped with smart navigation system and high-end automation system BMS (battery management system). The yacht owners will be surrounded by comfort, luxury, and advanced technology.

The research and development team meets the safety requirement of the Association of Classification Society. The IP65 lithium battery module is adopted and made with waterproofing protection. BMS is equipped with insulation detection function while the electricity control system is equipped with water ingress detection, automatic drainage, thermo regulator, and an automatic fire alarm system in order to keep the battery compartment functioning more reliably. The lithium battery module can be easily replaced through the matrix module. Further, if one or more modules malfunction, the entire system will still operate safely. The system embraces redundancy design that makes the protection system fundamentally safe.

At present, the company is going to cooperate with Jimei University to use the intelligent control system exclusively developed by Jimei University. It is expected that the first prototype ship will be built before March 2021.

Our Boat Models

Because the target environment in mainland China is with inland lakes, transporting large ships around would be rather inconvenient. Thus, our focus is not in the development of large ships, but in the development of small ships. This focus will correspond with the markets significant demand for these small ships as well. We plan to install the electric engine in the below models (Exhibit No. 10.3)
 1. 30ft fishing boat with cabin
 2. 30ft fishing boat without cabin
 3. 26ft fishing boat
 4. 22ft fishing boat
 5. 32ft catamaran sailing boat

Further, Khashing Yachts Industry (Guangdong) Limited develop smart driving system of electric yachts. In the future, electric yachts are expected to be equipped with the unmanned driving system. Such alliance will achieve synergy through our strengths for developing the smart yacht markets worldwide.
