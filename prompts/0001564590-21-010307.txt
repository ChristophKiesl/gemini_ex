Item 1. Business
Overview 
 
Tivity Health, Inc. (the “Company”), was founded and incorporated in Delaware in 1981.  Through our four programs, SilverSneakers® senior fitness, Prime® Fitness, WholeHealth LivingTM, and Wisely WellTM, we are focused on becoming the modern destination for healthy living, especially for seniors and older adults. 

We offer SilverSneakers to members of Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, and group retiree plans.  We also offer Prime Fitness, a fitness facility access program, through commercial health plans, employers, and other sponsoring organizations.  Our national network of fitness centers delivers both SilverSneakers and Prime Fitness.  Our fitness networks encompass approximately 16,000 partner locations and nearly 1,000 alternative locations that provide classes outside of traditional fitness centers. We also offer virtual fitness experiences, including live instructor-led classes. Through our WholeHealth Living program, which we sell primarily to health plans, we offer a continuum of services related to complementary, alternative, and physical medicine.  Our WholeHealth Living network includes relationships with approximately 18,000 complementary, alternative, and physical medicine practitioner locations to serve individuals through health plans and employers who seek health services such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, and more.  Finally, through our Wisely Well brand, we offer meals designed to support individuals and caregivers who are seeking meal convenience as well as those recovering after a hospitalization or living with chronic conditions.
 Effective as of December 9, 2020, we completed the sale of Nutrisystem, Inc. (“Nutrisystem”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that included the Nutrisystem® and South Beach Diet® programs, to KNS Acquisition Corp. (“Kainos”) pursuant to terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated October 18, 2020, by and among the Company, Kainos, and Kainos NS Holdings LP.  At the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the “Transactions”), Nutrisystem and its subsidiaries were acquired by, and became wholly owned subsidiaries of, Kainos.  Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Kainos paid to the Company an aggregate purchase price, after giving effect to customary indebtedness and cash adjustments, of approximately $559 million, which amount is subject to a customary working capital adjustment post-Closing.  We used the significant majority of the net proceeds from the divestiture to pay down $519 million of principal on the term loans under our Credit Agreement (as defined below).  Results of operations for Nutrisystem have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, and all related assets and liabilities have been classified as discontinued operations at December 31, 2019.
 The Company is headquartered at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin, Tennessee 37067.
 COVID-19 
 
In January 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declared a national public health emergency due to a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the disease known as “COVID-19.”  In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States and other countries.  Many state and local governments, together with public health officials, have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including ordering closure of certain businesses and imposing stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines for individuals. Such measures have resulted in significantly reduced demand for many businesses that have continued in operation.  
 
By March 31, 2020, substantially all of the fitness centers in our national network were temporarily closed, which had an adverse impact on our results from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2020 because a significant portion of revenues from our SilverSneakers program is based on member visits to a fitness partner location. A substantial number of our fitness partner locations remained closed through April, with some locations

reopening in May and additional locations reopening in June and throughout the third quarter of 2020. Due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases throughout the country, some fitness partner locations were closed again during the fourth quarter of 2020.  For the month of December 2020, approximately 74% of our fitness partner locations reported at least one visit from our SilverSneakers program.  From April through December 2020, the average monthly total participation levels of our SilverSneakers members were significantly below historical levels, and we also experienced a decline in paid subscribers for Prime Fitness, each of which adversely impacted revenues from continuing operations.  We are unable to predict with certainty how many of our fitness partner locations will be subject to any operational restrictions in the future and for what duration, or the level of member participation at our fitness partner locations.  
 
Customer and Partner Contracts
 Except for Prime Fitness, our customer contracts generally have initial terms of approximately three years.  Some contracts allow the customer to terminate early and/or determine on an annual basis to which of their members they will offer our programs.  For Prime Fitness, our contracts with commercial health plans, employers, and other sponsoring organizations generally have initial terms of approximately three years, while individuals who purchase the Prime Fitness program through these organizations may cancel at any time (on a monthly basis) after an initial period of one to three months. Our fitness partner location contracts generally have initial terms ranging from one to three years and auto-renew for successive one-year renewal terms. 
Business Strategy 
 
Our strategy is to become the modern destination for healthy living.  We will expand beyond fitness by establishing an engagement platform that enables personalized member interaction with all of our offerings, and we will partner with other payors and service providers to aggregate services to members under the SilverSneakers umbrella.  The continued development of our suite of digital offerings will enable a more tailored, interactive, and impactful experience across a variety of areas, including fitness, social connection, community involvement, volunteering, and enrichment.  In addition, we plan to accelerate growth in our WholeHealth Living offering through market share expansion and improved technology.  
Segment and Major Customer Information
 
Following the sale of Nutrisystem in December 2020, we have one operating and reportable segment.  
 During 2020, Humana, Inc. (“Humana”), United Healthcare, Inc. (“United Healthcare”), and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”, which relates to our Prime Fitness business) each comprised more than 10%, and together comprised 39%, of our revenues from continuing operations. Our primary contracts with each of Humana, United Healthcare, and BCBSA continue through December 31, 2022.  No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues from continuing operations in 2020.  See Note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report relating to revenues from external customers and customer concentration.
 Competition
 The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and the manner in which services are provided is subject to continual change. Other entities, whose financial and marketing resources may exceed our resources, may choose to initiate or expand programs in competition with our offerings.
 We believe we have certain advantages over our competitors such as:
  
• | the brand recognition of our programs such as SilverSneakers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | our long-term relationships with health plans;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | our proprietary class programming, including our growing digital programming;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the depth and breadth of our fitness center network relationships, which encompass approximately 16,000 partner locations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the trusting connections with our members developed over more than 25 years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with other entities who provide similar services.
 Industry Integration and Consolidation
 Consolidation remains an important factor in all aspects of the healthcare industry.  While we believe the size of our membership base provides us with the economies of scale to compete even in a consolidating market, we cannot assure you that we can effectively compete with companies formed as a result of industry consolidation or that we can retain existing customers if they are acquired by other entities that already have or contract for programs similar to ours or are not interested in our programs.
Governmental Regulation
 Governmental regulation impacts us in a number of ways in addition to those regulatory risks presented under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below.
 Health Reform
 In recent years, Congress and certain state governments have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to result in major changes within the healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), the most prominent of these efforts, changes how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through, among other things, expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to care quality and value.
  The ACA contains provisions that affect our customers, including commercial health plans and Medicare Advantage programs. Since 2010, when the ACA was enacted, the ACA has decreased the number of uninsured individuals, and expanded coverage through the expansion of public programs and private sector health insurance. However, the ACA also may increase costs and/or reduce the revenues of our customers or prospective customers. For example, the ACA prohibits commercial health plans from using gender, health status, family history, or occupation to set premium rates, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions, and bans annual benefit limits. In addition, the ACA established uniform minimum medical loss ratios (“MLRs”) for health plans, requiring a minimum percentage of health coverage premium revenue to be spent on healthcare medical costs and quality improvement expenses. The ACA also reduced premium payments to Medicare Advantage plans such that the managed care per capita payments paid by HHS to Medicare Advantage plans are now, on average, approximately equal to those for traditional Medicare.  There is substantial uncertainty regarding the ongoing effects of the ACA because the Trump administration and Congress have made significant changes to the ACA, its implementation and its interpretation. Final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential benefits mandated by the ACA.  Effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the ACA’s individual mandate. In December 2018, a federal court in Texas ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional as a result of this change and determined that the rest of the ACA was, therefore, invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate, but remanded for further consideration of how this affects the rest of the law. On November 10, 2020, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding this case, and the law remains in place pending the appeals process. It is difficult to predict whether, when or how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of implementation of any alternative provisions, the impact of alternative provisions on providers and other healthcare industry participants, and the ultimate outcome and impact of court challenges. The healthcare industry remains subject to ongoing health reform initiatives. For example, beginning in 2020, the Creating High-quality Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act of 2018 (“Chronic Care Act”) allows Medicare Advantage plans to cover supplemental benefits that are not primarily health-related, but that have the reasonable expectation of improving or maintaining health.  Additionally, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payor proposals (often referred to as "Medicare for All"). Further, the potential impact of the 2020 federal election on health reform efforts is unknown. 
 Other Laws
 While many of the governmental and regulatory requirements affecting healthcare delivery generally do not directly apply to us, our customers must comply with a variety of regulations including those governing Medicare

Advantage plans and their marketing and the licensing and reimbursement requirements of federal, state and local agencies. Certain of our services, including health service utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure by state government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses.
 Federal privacy regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) extensively restrict the use and disclosure of individually-identifiable health information by health plans, most healthcare providers, and certain other entities (collectively, “covered entities”). Federal security regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA require covered entities to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic individually-identifiable health information. Because we handle individually-identifiable health information on behalf of covered entities, we are considered a "business associate" and are required to comply with most aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties for each violation. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 In the event of a data breach involving individually-identifiable health information, we are subject to contractual obligations and state and federal requirements that require us to notify our customers. These requirements may also require us or our customers to notify affected individuals, regulatory agencies, and the media of the data breach. Under HIPAA, non-permitted uses and disclosures of unsecured individually identifiable health information are presumed to be breaches for which notice is required, unless it can be demonstrated that there is a low probability the information has been compromised.
 In addition, there are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing the confidentiality and security of confidential personal information that may apply to us directly or us contractually. These laws vary, are subject to frequent changes and updates in regulations, and could impose additional penalties and other legal liability. For example, the potential effects of the CCPA (as defined under Item 1A “Risk Factors”) are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data use and data breaches. If we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties, money damages, and criminal penalties. 
 Federal law contains various prohibitions related to false statements and false claims, some of which apply to private payors as well as federal programs. Our contracts with Medicare Advantage plans may subject us to a number of obligations, including billing and reimbursement requirements, prohibitions on fraudulent and abusive conduct and related training and screening obligations. Actions may be brought under the federal False Claims Act by the government as well as by private individuals, known as “whistleblowers,” who are permitted to share in any settlement or judgment. Liability under the federal False Claims Act arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal False Claims Act defines the term “knowingly” broadly. There are many other potential bases for liability under the federal False Claims Act, including knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. The submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of certain “fraud and abuse” provisions of the Social Security Act, including the anti-kickback provisions, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the federal False Claims Act. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government, and some courts have taken the position that entities that allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the federal self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the federal False Claims Act.
 From time to time, participants in the healthcare industry, including the Company and our customers, may be subject to actions under the federal False Claims Act or other fraud and abuse laws, including similar state statutes, and it is not possible to predict the impact of such actions. Violations of applicable laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. For example, violations of the federal False Claims Act may result in penalties of three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.

Because of the international operations previously conducted as part of our total population health services (“TPHS”) business that we sold to Sharecare, Inc. in July 2016, we were subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale. The FCPA and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation prior to the sale of our TPHS business could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties.
 Intellectual Property 
 We own numerous trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to our success. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
Human Capital Resources
 
Employee Profile
 
As of February 22, 2021, we had approximately 350 employees, comprised of 35% male and 65% female.  Of our total employees, 54% were based out of our office in Chandler, Arizona, 13% were based out of our office in Franklin, Tennessee, and the remaining 33% were based off-campus within the United States.  We believe we have good relationships with our employees, and we encourage open and candid communication to ensure we maintain positive relationships.
Health and Safety
 
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees.  We have implemented health and safety policies and practices, taking into account CDC guidance and any applicable state or local requirements, to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including adopting flexible work-from-home arrangements, imposing travel restrictions, promoting social distancing, and increasing cleaning protocols at our two office locations.  Since March 2020, we have not required our employees to work in the office; in June 2020, we began allowing employees to work in the office at their election, with increased office sanitation measures and the expectation that employees are adhering to social distancing and mask protocols. 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We embrace diversity and inclusion and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures.  Our CEO has pledged his commitment to the CEO Action for Diversity & InclusionTM, which outlines a specific set of actions the CEO will take to cultivate a trusting environment where all ideas are welcomed, and employees feel comfortable and empowered to have discussions about diversity and inclusion.  To further this effort and in addition to our existing communication vehicles, we have created an internal diversity and inclusion council, launched a diversity-focused listening series, and conducted unconscious bias training sessions with our employees. With the assistance of our diversity and inclusion council, we continue to explore additional diversity and inclusion initiatives.
Employee Engagement
 We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, confidence in Company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and improvements on how we could make our Company an employer of choice. The results are shared with the entire organization and are reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in employee engagement.  We have also established regular communication between the CEO and employees.  Finally, we monitor employee turnover, with a particular emphasis on regretted turnover, and conduct exit interviews with departing employees.
