ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Development of Business
Conagra Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our", or "us"), is one of North America's leading branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the Company combines a rich heritage of making great food with a sharpened focus on innovation. The Company's portfolio is evolving to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its iconic brands such as Marie Callender's®, Reddi-wip®, Hunt's®, Healthy Choice®, Slim Jim®, Orville Redenbacher's®, as well as emerging brands, including Alexia®, Blake's®, and Frontera®, offer choices for every occasion.
We began as a Midwestern flour-milling company and entered other commodity-based businesses throughout our history. We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 1975. Over time, we transformed into the branded, pure-play consumer packaged goods food company we are today. We achieved this through various acquisitions, including consumer food brands such as Banquet®, Chef Boyardee®, Marie Callender’s®, Alexia®, Blake's®, Frontera®, Duke’s®, BIGS®, and divestitures. We have divested our Lamb Weston business, Private Brands business, Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business, JM Swank business, milling business, dehydrated and fresh vegetable operations, and a trading and merchandising business, among others. Growing our food businesses has also been fueled by innovation, organic growth of our brands, and expansion into adjacent categories. We are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth with strong and improving returns on our invested capital.
On November 9, 2016, we completed the spinoff of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. ("Lamb Weston") through a distribution of 100% of our interest in Lamb Weston to holders of outstanding shares of our common stock (the "Spinoff"). The transaction effecting this change was structured as a tax-free spinoff. 
In January 2013, we acquired Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. ("Ralcorp"), a manufacturer of private branded food. Since the acquisition of Ralcorp, we focused on addressing executional shortfalls and customer service issues intended to improve operating performance for our Private Brands business. However, after further review of the Private Brands business, we changed our strategic direction and divested the Private Brands business in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
In fiscal 2017, we completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters to Chicago, Illinois. Our efficiency and effectiveness initiatives continue to be implemented with a high degree of customer focus, food safety and quality, and commitment to our people.
Financial Information about Reporting Segments
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, in anticipation of the Spinoff, we reorganized our reporting segments. We now reflect our results of operations in five reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice, and Commercial. The contributions of each reporting segment to net sales, operating profit, and identifiable assets are set forth in Note 21 "Business Segments and Related Information" to the consolidated financial statements.
Narrative Description of Business
We compete throughout the food industry and focus on adding value for our customers who operate in the retail food and foodservice channels.
Our operations, including our reporting segments, are described below. Our locations, including manufacturing facilities, within each reporting segment, are described in Item 2, Properties.

Reporting Segments
Our reporting segments are as follows:
Grocery & Snacks
The Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf stable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.
Refrigerated & Frozen
The Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.

The segment's primary food items included a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods, which were sold under brands such as Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings®. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold our Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. These businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations.
Unconsolidated Equity Investments
We have three unconsolidated equity investments. Our most significant equity method investment is a milling business (see "Formation of Ardent Mills" below).
Acquisitions
In March 2017, we acquired protein-based snacking businesses Thanasi Foods LLC, maker of Duke’s® meat snacks, and BIGS LLC, maker of BIGS® seeds. These businesses are included in the Grocery & Snacks segment.
In September 2016, we acquired the operating assets of Frontera Foods, Inc. and Red Fork LLC, including the Frontera®, Red Fork®, and Salpica® brands (the "Frontera acquisition"). These businesses make authentic, gourmet Mexican food products and contemporary American cooking sauces. These businesses are reflected principally within the Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within the Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments.
In May 2015, we acquired Blake's All Natural Foods, a family-owned company specializing in frozen meals, including pot pies, casseroles, pasta dishes, and other entrees. This business is included in the Refrigerated & Frozen segment.

On November 9, 2016, we completed the Spinoff of our Lamb Weston business. As of such date, we did not beneficially own any equity interest in Lamb Weston and no longer consolidated Lamb Weston into our financial results. We reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the Lamb Weston business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the period presented prior to the Spinoff.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sales of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business ("Spicetec") and our JM Swank business for combined proceeds of $489.0 million. The results of operations of Spicetec and JM Swank are included in the Commercial segment.
On February 1, 2016, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2015, we completed the disposition of our Private Brands operations to TreeHouse Foods, Inc. ("Treehouse"). The Private Brands assets and liabilities have been reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented prior to the divestiture and the results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Formation of Ardent Mills
On May 29, 2014, the Company, Cargill, Incorporated ("Cargill"), and CHS Inc. ("CHS"), completed the formation of Ardent Mills, which combined the North American flour milling operations and related businesses operated through the ConAgra Mills division of ConAgra Foods and the Horizon Milling joint venture of Cargill and CHS. We reflected the operating results of our legacy milling business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Our equity in the earnings of Ardent Mills is reflected in our continuing operations.
General
The following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments.
Conagra Brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded, private branded, and value-added consumer food, as well as foodservice items and ingredients. We use many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. From time to time, we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives, and the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption.
We experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets. Our food items compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded food, as well as private branded and customized food items. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service, brand recognition, and brand loyalty.
Demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events.
We manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales, and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant.
Our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the United States and most other markets where the related food items are sold. Some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others. We also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
Many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality, sanitation, safety and health matters, and environmental control. We believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects 
3

and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.
Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 24%, 23%, and 20% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
At May 28, 2017, Conagra Brands and its subsidiaries had approximately 12,600 employees, primarily in the United States. Approximately 47% of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements, approximately 6% are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2018. We believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.
Research and Development
We employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition, we conduct research activities related to the development of new products. Research and development expense was $44.6 million, $59.6 million, and $63.1 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
