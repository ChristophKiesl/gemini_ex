Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T cell engagers that harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases. T cell engagers are engineered proteins that direct a patient’s own T cells to kill target cells that express specific proteins, or antigens, carried by the target cells.We are developing a pipeline of novel T cell engagers using our proprietary TriTACs, initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. We have also nominated our first clinical candidate using our proprietary ProTriTAC platform, a prodrug version of our TriTAC platform, designed to expand the target space for T cell engagers and bring the benefits of TriTACs to a broader number of patients. Since commencing operations in 2015, we have created four TriTAC product candidates that are all in clinical development.
 A summary of our four TriTAC product candidates is as follows:
 
 
• | HPN424, currently in the dose-escalation portion of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. Presentation of Phase 1 data and initiation of an expansion cohort is planned for the first half of 2021. Interim data from this expansion cohort is anticipated by the end of 2021.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HPN536, currently in the dose-escalation portion of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for the treatment of ovarian and pancreatic cancers and other mesothelin-, or MSLN-, expressing solid tumors. Initiation of an expansion cohort is anticipated in the second half of 2021, with a presentation of Phase 1 data by year-end 2021.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HPN217, currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial targeting B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, for the treatment of multiple myeloma, as well as entered into a Development and Option Agreement with AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., or AbbVie. Under our agreement with AbbVie, we have already received an upfront payment of $30 million and a development milestone payment of $50 million, as we dosed our first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217 in April 2020. Additionally, we are eligible to receive future payments totaling up to $430 million upon AbbVie’s exercise of an exclusive license option and achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, in addition to receipt of royalties on commercial sales. We are responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217 under our agreement with AbbVie. In January 2021, HPN217 received orphan drug designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma. A presentation of interim data is anticipated in 2021, with initiation of a dose expansion cohort in the second half of 2021. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HPN328, currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, and other DLL3-expressing tumors. Presentation of initial data is planned for the second half of 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A summary of our ProTriTAC product candidate is as follows:
 
 
• | HPN601, currently in preclinical development, is the first drug candidate from the ProTriTAC platform. HPN601 targets the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and is being developed for the treatment of multiple solid tumor indications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our TriTACs are designed to advance the therapeutic potential of T cell engagers, a therapeutic approach with an established and proven mechanism of action. The first bi-specific T cell engager, or BiTE, to be approved by the FDA was Amgen’s Blincyto. Blincyto was approved in 2014 as a monotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Since then, other BiTEs have shown promising therapeutic potential in clinical trials. We developed our proprietary TriTAC platform to incorporate the strengths of BiTEs and improve upon their critical shortcomings, such as a short half-life. We believe our TriTAC platform offers the following features for the discovery and development of novel immunotherapies to treat a wide array of diseases, including cancer: 
  
• | Active at Low Levels of Target Expression. We designed TriTACs to be active at low levels of antigen expression where other treatment modalities lose efficacy. In our preclinical studies, TriTACs did not require high levels of target antigen expression to engage T cells to kill disease cells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MHC Independence. We designed TriTACs to specifically direct T cells to kill target cells independent of major histocompatibility complex, or MHC expression. Tumor cells frequently acquire mutations that change the MHC molecule or reduce the level of MHC expressed on their surfaces, thus making the tumor cells less susceptible to being killed by either endogenous T cells or engineered T cells that require MHC recognition. We believe that because TriTACs do not require a T cell clone with specific T cell receptor or MHC recognition to kill tumor cells, they will be able to generate greater and more durable therapeutic responses than MHC dependent approaches. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Extended Half-Life and Stability. We designed TriTACs to be stable in the bloodstream and to have a long-serum half-life in order to achieve efficacy without requiring the continuous IV administration that is a limiting requirement of other T cell engagers, such as BiTEs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Small Size and Tissue Penetration. TriTACs are small in size, and we believe this is critical for their efficient penetration of, and diffusion within, solid tumors. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modularity. The TriTAC structure is modular and its antigen binding domain can easily be switched out to enable the rapid discovery and development of new TriTAC product candidates across a wide variety of targets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety Design Elements. We designed TriTACs to enable T cell engagement while minimizing off-target toxicity and the potential for CRS, which is a potentially lethal reaction of the body to the hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conventional Manufacturing. TriTACs are “off-the-shelf” therapies, the manufacturing of which is significantly less complex than that of personalized or cell-based therapies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We seek to selectively collaborate with leading biopharmaceutical companies to leverage our technology platforms. For example, in November 2019 we entered into a Development and Option Agreement with AbbVie, pursuant to which we granted to AbbVie an option to license worldwide exclusive rights to HPN217. We will be responsible for developing HPN217 through a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Upon exercise of the option, which AbbVie may exercise following delivery by the Company of a specified data package arising from the Phase 1/2 trial, AbbVie would be responsible for all future clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization activities. The Development and Option Agreement represents a potential transaction value of up to $510 million in upfront, option and milestone payments, of which $80 million has been received to date, plus royalties on potential global commercial sales. 
 In addition, in November 2019, we expanded our existing collaboration with AbbVie by entering into an Amended and Restated Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Restated Collaboration Agreement, which agreement amends and restates the Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement we had entered into with AbbVie in October 2017, or the Original Collaboration Agreement. The expansion of the collaboration grants to AbbVie the right to select two additional targets and an option to select up to four further targets, in addition to the two targets previously selected by AbbVie under the Collaboration Agreement. Consistent with the Collaboration Agreement, we and AbbVie will conduct certain initial research and discovery activities for each designated target, after which AbbVie will be solely responsible for further development and commercialization efforts. We have received a total of $37 million of upfront payments under this collaboration to date. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $2.4 billion in potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments under the Restated Collaboration Agreement, plus royalties on global commercial sales. 
 COVID-19 Impact
 Our assessment to date continues to support that we have not experienced any material delays or significant financial impacts directly related to the pandemic other than some minor disruptions to clinical operations, including patient enrollment in some of our clinical trials. We will continue to monitor the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, assets and operations, including our personnel, programs, expected timelines, expenses, third-party contract manufacturing, contract research organizations and clinical trials.
 While we are currently continuing our clinical trials we have underway in sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, we expect that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our clinical trials, as a result of potential delays or difficulties in enrolling or assessing patients in our clinical trials, clinical site initiation, diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, interruption of key clinical trial activities, among other factors. We could also see an impact on our ability to interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority, personnel resources or otherwise. In addition, in response to the ongoing spread of COVID-19, we have established testing protocols for personnel access to our headquarter offices and laboratory, although substantially all of our employees and contractors that continue to telecommute. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, assets, operations and clinical trials, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time. See “Risk factors—Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus. A COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing in many parts of the world and may result in significant disruptions which could materially affect our operations, including at our headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area and at our clinical trial sites.” for more information regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations. We continue to actively monitor this situation and the possible effects on our business and operations

Our Pipeline 
 We are leveraging our proprietary TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms to discover and develop product candidates to treat cancer and other diseases. The following table summarizes key information about our product candidates to date, all of which were developed using our TriTAC platform. We own the intellectual property rights to both our TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms and the underlying critical components of our product candidates. 
Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to harness innovations in immunotherapy and protein engineering to rapidly advance our novel TriTAC product candidates through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization, with an initial focus on cancer. This strategy encompasses the following key elements: 

• | Advance our TriTAC product candidates directed at clinically validated targets from discovery through clinical development and regulatory approval. We have developed a robust and efficient internal research effort that is focused on advancing a portfolio of therapeutic product candidates from initial discovery through clinical development, and ultimately, to treat patients suffering from cancer. We have discovered and advanced four product candidates to treat solid and hematologic malignancies, two of which are currently in the clinic. We expect to advance our third and fourth programs into the clinic in 2020. These programs are directed against targets that are both clinically validated and which are ideally suited for our TriTAC platform due to limited expression on healthy tissue. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the pipeline of oncology candidates for our TriTAC technology platform and develop other novel platforms. Our current research efforts are focused on evaluating potential new product candidates based on our TriTAC technology. In addition, we are actively exploring new technologies, which may improve the safety of certain therapeutic approaches or expand our ability to address therapeutic targets with increased specificity to diseased tissues. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our novel technology platforms to target a broad range of disease. Our TriTAC and other platforms may have the ability to address disease targets outside of oncology. We intend to evaluate opportunities to expand our research to other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune diseases and anti-infectives either internally or through strategic partnerships. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Selectively collaborate with leading biopharmaceutical companies to leverage our platforms, expand our portfolio, advance our product candidates and maximize their commercial potential. While we intend to retain significant ownership of our current pipeline product candidates, we recognize the benefits of collaborations. We seek collaborations that can: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) | Broaden the reach of our technology platforms to other novel targets in oncology or other areas that are not a focus for our company. For example, we entered into a collaboration with AbbVie in October 2017, which was expanded in November 2019, that widens the utility for our TriTAC platform by developing candidates against novel soluble T cell receptor, or TCR, and antibody targets for the treatment of cancer.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Provide us with strategic access to clinical and commercial capabilities, particularly in geographic areas we are unlikely to pursue on our own. For example, multiple myeloma is an indication with several therapeutic approaches competing both clinically and commercially. AbbVie has an extensive presence in hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, which can benefit us as we develop a clinical plan that best positions HPN217 for commercial success. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Expedite commercial presence and distribution of our products, if approved. Utilizing an existing commercial marketing and distribution organization may be more cost effective in certain indications and geographies we are pursuing, rather than building our own commercial infrastructure. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our TriTAC Platform 
 Our proprietary TriTAC platform offers the potential to develop drugs that could dramatically change the way in which we combat a variety of diseases. It is well accepted that the immune system can be harnessed to eradicate and prevent the proliferation of cancer cells. Recent successes using immunologic approaches have revealed methods of modulating a cancer patient’s immune system to battle the growth and spread of tumors. In most cases, T cells have been central to this approach, and the pathways to unleash the tumor-killing properties of T cells have resulted in multiple recent drug approvals. 
 We believe our TriTACs represent the evolution of a validated cancer-killing modality that engages T cells to kill tumors. The first approved T cell engager, a BiTE developed by Amgen and marketed as Blincyto, was approved in 2014 for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With our TriTAC platform, we set out to design a T cell engager that incorporates the strengths of BiTEs (including small size and activity at low levels of antigen expression) and improves upon their critical shortcomings (including short half-life and limited stability).

We designed our TriTAC product candidates with three primary components: a CD3 binding domain for T cell engagement, a proprietary half-life extension domain and an antigen-bonding domain. TriTACs consist of a single-chain polypeptide designed to bind to a cancer surface antigen, human serum albumin and the CD3 epsilon subunit of the TCR. Tumor-targeting and albumin-binding are achieved by single domain antibodies, or sdAbs, while CD3 is bound by a single-chain variable fragment, or scFv. When TriTACs simultaneously bind cell surface antigens and T cells, they induce the formation of a cytolytic synapse that mimics the natural interaction between TCRs and MHCs. This interaction activates T cells to kill target cells, as demonstrated in the figure below. 


Our TriTAC Product Candidates 
 HPN424: PSMA-targeting TriTAC 
 We are developing our lead TriTAC product candidate, HPN424, for the treatment of prostate cancer. HPN424 targets PSMA, a protein for which expression is largely restricted to both normal and malignant prostate-derived cells. HPN424 provides a differentiated mechanism of action compared to the current standard of care, as this targeted approach is designed to safely engage and direct T cells to kill cancer cells. In April 2019, data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology demonstrated the encouraging clinical responses of Amgen’s BiTE targeting PSMA in mCRPC patients. However, this product candidate, AMG212, requires continuous IV infusion, which could limit its adoption and accessibility. In December 2020, we announced that as of the December 1, 2020 data cutoff date, 69 patients have been dosed across 14 cohorts at fixed doses of 1.3 to 160ng/kg and in step dosing cohorts up to 300ng/kg administered as a weekly intravenous infusion. Enrolled patients had a median of 6 prior systemic therapies, and 76% of patients had prior chemotherapy in the metastatic castration-resistant setting. Ten of 44 patients (23%) with treatment start dates at least 6 months prior remained on study treatment for more than 24 weeks.
 At the highest fixed dose tested to date, 160ng/kg, one patient out of 7 experienced a confirmed partial response with target lesion reduction of 43%. 3 of 7 patients have had serum PSA declines from baseline, one of which was a PSA reduction of 50%.
 HPN424 was generally well tolerated amongst patients and cytokine-related adverse events have been manageable. Reported Grade 3 or higher adverse events have included cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (9%), using CRS grading criteria described by Lee, et al (2014), ALT increase (11%) and AST increase (11%). CRS events and transaminitis have been transient and have not resulted in treatment discontinuation. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been observed and have not limited escalation. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been identified. Presentation of Phase 1 data and initiation of an expansion cohort is planned for the first half of 2021. Interim data from this expansion cohort is anticipated by the end of 2021.

Market Opportunity 
 The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute, or SEER, estimates that there will be over 191,000 new diagnoses and over 33,000 deaths as a result of prostate cancer in the United States in 2020. Prostate cancer is expected to have the third-highest cancer incidence rate in 2020 and is the second leading cause of male cancer death in the United States. 
 While the five-year survival rate of local and regional prostate cancer is nearly 98%, more aggressive forms of the disease, of which approximately 22% are initially diagnosed, have a five-year survival rate of approximately 30%. While these more aggressive forms of prostate cancer can initially be treated, nearly all of these patients experience a recurrence in tumor growth that results in the subsequent development of mCRPC. Nearly all prostate cancer-specific deaths occur after patients develop mCRPC, for which the median overall survival period is only 13 months. Later-generation anti-androgen drugs such as Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga, Pfizer’s/Astellas’ Xtandi, Janssen’s Erleada, and Bayer’s Nubeqa have widely become the standard of care and generated combined global sales of over $6 billion in 2020. While these therapies have addressed a portion of the population, there remains a significant need for treatments that offer a novel mechanism of action with the potential to modify or cure the disease. 
Clinical Development Plan 
 In August 2018, we initiated a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label dose escalation and dose expansion trial of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of HPN424 in mCRPC patients. Eligible patients must have mCRPC, have received at least two prior treatment regiments for mCRPC and have evidence of disease progression on the most recent systemic treatment regimen.  The dose escalation phase is currently using a 3+3 design with dose cohorts that enroll three to six patients per cohort. The trial is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and a recommended Phase 2 dose. Our primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels. Our secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as preliminary potential anti-tumor activity and biomarker data. We continue to enroll patients in the dose-escalation portion of the clinical trial. Presentation of Phase 1 data and initiation of an expansion cohort is planned for the first half of 2021. Interim data from this expansion cohort is anticipated by the end of 2021.  
 Phase 1 Preliminary Results
 In January 2019, we announced preliminary data from seven patients in our ongoing dose escalation study, treated at doses ranging from 1.3 to 24 ng/kg, as of December 31, 2018, which supports the proposed mechanism of action of HPN424. All seven patients were treated previously with a second-generation anti-androgen therapy. From those seven patients, we noted preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis supports weekly dosing, T cell engagement via transient and dose-dependent increases in peripheral cytokines and chemokines and a reduction in circulating tumor cells, or CTC, in several of the evaluable patients. Adverse events were consistent with the expected mechanism of action, with three patients reporting grade 2 rigors or fevers that were manageable. One patient from the fourth cohort experienced what was initially categorized as a grade 3 CRS event (rigors and hypotension), which resolved within eight hours of dosing. This patient was re-administered HPN424 consistent with protocol guidelines. The patient experienced no further reactions.  No dose limiting toxicities had been observed, with four dose levels tested.  In August 2019, we provided an update on our HPN424 trial that focused on our experience in managing cytokine-related events.  Consistent with the TriTAC mechanism of action, we had observed adverse events associated with T cell activation and cytokine induction, which prompted us to explore the use of dexamethasone as a premedication to limit potential adverse events. We had found that the addition of weekly dexamethasone premedication, tapered over several weeks, had successfully limited adverse events. Several patients had completed the scheduled taper and had successfully continued treatment with HPN424 in the absence of dexamethasone. In December 2020, we announced that as of the December 1, 2020 data cutoff date, 69 patients have been dosed across 14 cohorts at fixed doses of 1.3 to 160ng/kg and in step dosing cohorts up to 300ng/kg administered as a weekly intravenous infusion. Enrolled patients had a median of 6 prior systemic therapies, and 76% of patients had prior chemotherapy in the metastatic castration-resistant setting. Ten of 44 patients (23%) with treatment start dates at least 6 months ago remained on study treatment for more than 24 weeks.
 HPN536: MSLN-Targeting TriTAC 
 We are developing HPN536 for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other MSLN-expressing tumors, which include mesothelioma, pancreatic carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, or NSCLC, and triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC, among others. HPN536 targets MSLN, a cell-surface protein whose normal expression is largely restricted to mesothelial cell layers lining certain organs. MSLN is attractive for target-based therapeutics because it is expressed on a wide variety of tumor cells but has limited expression in normal tissue. Early signs of clinical efficacy generated by other treatment modalities have validated MSLN as an attractive tumor target, but therapies with improved efficacy are required to treat MSLN-expressing tumors. In 2018, we completed an IND-enabling, multi-dose GLP toxicology study in animals. HPN536, which has been observed to bind to cynomolgus monkey MSLN with comparable affinities as human MSLN, delivered clear histological evidence of target engagement. In April 2019, we initiated a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, open-label dose escalation and dose expansion trial of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 
 11


HPN536 and are actively recruiting patients with ovarian and pancreatic cancer in the dose-escalation portion of the trial. In December 2020, we provided an update on HPN536. We highlighted that dosing had occurred across 9 fixed-dose cohorts of 6 to 280ng/kg and 1 step dose cohort up to 600ng/kg. Tumor types treated include late-stage ovarian and pancreatic cancers and peritoneal mesothelioma. Enrolled patients had a median of four prior systemic therapies, and 66% of patients had progressive disease as best response to their most recent prior therapy. Pharmacokinetic analysis shows median half-life of more than 70 hours. Among the relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer patients with at least one post-baseline scan, 8 of 12 (67%) patients showed stability of target lesions.
 HPN536 appears to be well tolerated. One CRS grade 3 occurred in the absence of dexamethasone premedication treatment. The CRS resolved, and the patient continued on study with dexamethasone premedication. As of the December 1, 2020 data cutoff date, no DLTs have been observed. Initiation of an expansion cohort is anticipated in the second half of 2021, with a presentation of Phase 1 data by year-end 2021.
 Market Opportunity 
 MSLN-expressing tumors include ovarian cancer, NSCLC, pancreatic carcinoma, mesothelioma and TNBC, among others. While MSLN is found in approximately 30% of all cancers, these specific cancers have particularly high levels of MSLN expression. The following table shows the MSLN expression level of, and the number of patients diagnosed in the United States in 2020 with, each of these cancers: 

Cancer Type | New Patients Diagnosed in the United States | | | MSLN Expression Level (%)
------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+---------+-----+--------------------------
Ovarian Cancer | | 21,750 | | | 60-65 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer | | 194,000 | *** | | 60-65 *
Pancreatic Carcinoma | | 57,600 | | | 80-85 
Mesothelioma | | 3,000 | | | 85-90 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer | | 41,000 | ** | | 34-42 


* | Represents MSLN expression levels across all lung cancer types.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


** | Calculated as 15% of SEER-estimated breast cancer incidence.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------


*** | Calculated as 85% of SEER-estimated lung cancer incidence
----+----------------------------------------------------------

 
Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the United States, and is the deadliest of gynecologic cancers with more than 70% of patients diagnosed with an advanced stage and over 14,000 patients dying from the disease each year. According to SEER, the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer is approximately 49%. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, estimated to comprise 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnoses. The five-year survival rate for NSCLC is about 20%. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancers in the world. In 2016, the seven major markets (the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan) saw 149,780 new cases of pancreatic cancer and in 2020, there were approximately 57,000 new cases in the United States. SEER estimates that fewer than 9% of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive five years. Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer that affects the lining or membrane that covers and protects certain organs in the body. Effective treatment options for patients with mesothelioma are very limited. TNBC is referred to as “triple-negative” because it is ER-, PR- and HER2-, and is unlikely respond to hormonal or HER2-targeted therapies. TNBC accounts for 10-20% of all breast cancers and is more aggressive and likely to recur compared to receptor-positive breast cancers. The five-year survival rate for TNBC is 77% as compared to >90% for other types of breast cancers. 
 Clinical Development Plan 
 In April 2019, we initiated a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, open-label dose escalation and dose expansion trial of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of HPN536 and are actively recruiting patients with ovarian and pancreatic cancer. The study consists of two phases, an initial dose escalation phase with ovarian and pancreatic cancer patients, followed by an expansion phase of up to three additional parallel cohorts of 20 patients each with ovarian, pancreatic and mesothelioma cancer. We are collecting data to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary clinical activity of HPN536. The dose escalation phase is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and a recommended Phase 2 dose. Once a recommended Phase 2 dose is determined, we expect to initiate the dose expansion phase with three parallel 20-patient cohorts, conducted according to a Simon 2-stage design. The cohorts will be indication-specific, and we expect to enroll patients with ovarian cancer, mesothelioma and pancreatic carcinoma. Initiation of an expansion cohort is anticipated by the second half of 2021, with a presentation of Phase 1 data by year end 2021.

HPN217: BCMA-Targeting TriTAC 
 We are developing HPN217 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. HPN217 targets BCMA, a clinically validated target. BCMA is a tumor necrosis factor receptor super family member and is a receptor protein expressed on nearly all multiple myeloma cells. Early data from CAR-T and ADC have clinically validated the target. 
 In December 2020, we announced that relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients have been treated across 6 fixed dose cohorts of 5 to 810µg, reflecting a more than 100-fold increase in dose in 8 months. HPN217 has been well-tolerated, and no DLTs have been observed as of the December 1, 2020 cutoff date. In January 2021, HPN217 received orphan drug designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma. A presentation of interim data is anticipated in 2021, with initiation of a dose expansion cohort in the second half of 2021.
 In November 2019, we entered into an exclusive worldwide Development and Option Agreement with AbbVie for HPN217. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted to AbbVie an option to license worldwide exclusive rights to HPN217. We will be responsible for agreed-upon development activities of HPN217 through an initial Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Upon exercise of the option, AbbVie will be responsible for all future clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization activities. AbbVie may exercise its license option at any time during a period commencing on the effective date of the agreement and expiring after a specified period following delivery by us of a specified data package arising from the first Phase 1/2 trial for the HPN217 products. AbbVie paid an upfront payment of $30 million and a development milestone payment of $50 million triggered upon dosing the first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial within a specified time period, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2020. If AbbVie exercises its option, AbbVie will pay us an option exercise fee of $200 million, and potential future payments of $230 million for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones for HPN217 Products along with high single-digit to very low double-digit royalties on commercial sales.
 Market Opportunity 
 Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer formed by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, crowding out normal plasma cells that play an important role in the immune system. Multiple myeloma is the second most prevalent blood cancer after Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. There are approximately 229,000 people living with myeloma worldwide, with 114,000 new cases diagnosed and 87,000 deaths each year. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 32,000 new cases will be diagnosed and approximately 13,000 deaths are expected to occur from multiple myeloma in the United States in 2020. Despite advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma over the past decade, we believe there remains a significant unmet need as the five-year survival rate is only approximately 50%. 
 
HPN328: DLL3-Targeting TriTAC
 We are developing HPN328 for the treatment of SCLC and other neuroendocrine tumors associated with DLL3 expression. DLL3 is a protein highly expressed in a majority of SCLC tumors and cancer stem cells, but not expressed in normal tissue. This selective expression makes DLL3 an attractive drug target for T cell engagers. In January 2021, we announced that the first patient had been dosed with HPN328 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial as an investigational treatment of SCLC and other tumors associated with DLL3 expression. We continue to enroll patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and plan to present initial data in the second half of 2021.
 Market Opportunity 
 Approximately 30,000 patients are diagnosed with SCLC annually in the United States, representing 10-15% of lung cancer diagnoses. The five-year relative survival rate for patients with Stage I, II, III and IV SCLC is approximately 31%, 19%, 8% and 2%, respectively. T cell targeting checkpoint inhibitors, such as Tecentriq, Imfinzi and Keytruda have been approved for use in SCLC patients, supporting immunotherapy as a new treatment alternative for SCLC. We believe there is still a significant unmet need remains for new therapies for these patients. 
Preclinical Data
 In October 2019, we presented data on HPN328 for the treatment of SCLC at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. HPN328 was well-tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys at 1 and 10 mg/kg and pharmacokinetic data supported the potential for once weekly dosing. When administered to mice bearing human SCLC xenografts and human T cells, HPN328 eradicated the tumors.

Our ProTriTAC Platform
 ProTriTAC—An Expansion of TriTAC’s Capabilities 
 In order to expand the universe of addressable targets and indications, we are actively developing our proprietary ProTriTAC platform. Our ProTriTAC platform applies a prodrug concept to create a therapeutic T cell engager that remains inactive until it reaches the tumor. ProTriTACs therefore have the potential for additional tumor specificity and enhanced safety profiles because they are designed to have limited interaction with their molecular targets in healthy tissue, allowing us to target tumor-associated antigens that may be more broadly expressed. When a ProTriTAC penetrates a tumor, tumor-associated proteases cleave off the blocking domain of the ProTriTAC, thereby enabling the engagement of T cells to subsequently kill tumor cells. This activation process also diminishes the half-life of the resulting T cell engager so active molecules that leave the tumor are rapidly eliminated from circulation without causing off-tissue side effects. 
Our ProTriTAC Product Candidate 
 HPN601 
 HPN601 is currently in preclinical development, and it is the first drug candidate from our ProTriTAC platform. HPN601 targets the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and is being developed for the treatment of multiple solid tumor indications. EpCAM is a tumor antigen that is broadly and uniformly expressed in many solid tumors; however, expression on some normal tissues has hindered its potential as a therapeutic target due to on-target, off-tumor toxicity as observed in clinical studies from past EpCAM targeted T cell engagers. The goal of developing HPN601, a conditionally active T cell engager, is to target all EpCAM-positive metastatic tumors by systemic administration and have an acceptable safety profile. 
Market Opportunity 
 EpCAM is a tumor antigen that is broadly and uniformly expressed in many solid tumors. Thyroid, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate, ovarian, endometrial, pancreatic, gastric, gallbladder, biliary, esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancer all have greater than 70% prevalence for EpCAM expression. These cancers combined represent approximately 345,000 patient deaths in the US each year.
 14


Preclinical Data 
 In November 2020, we presented preclinical data on HPN601 for the treatment of solid tumors at the 35th Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) virtual annual meeting. The oral presentation highlighted the following data: 

• | The successful use of a humanized rodent tumor xenograft model to assess therapeutic index by simultaneously measuring efficacy and toxicity in the same tumor-bearing animal
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A surrogate EpCAM ProTriTAC has a 10x improved therapeutic index compared to its corresponding constitutively active T cell engager control when measuring efficacy and toxicity in the same animal
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved tolerability of HPN601 in non-human primates and more potent anti-tumor activity in a rodent tumor model over the corresponding constitutively active T cell engager control
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potent anti-tumor activity across multiple EpCAM-expressing tumor models, demonstrating the ability of HPN601 to be activated in multiple tumor types
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaboration and License Agreements 
 Development and Option Agreement with AbbVie Biotechnology
 On November 20, 2019, we entered into a Development and Option Agreement with AbbVie in connection with our HPN217 program, which targets B cell maturation antigen, or BCMA. Pursuant to such Agreement, we granted to AbbVie an option to a worldwide, exclusive license under our patents and know-how applicable to the HPN217 program to develop, manufacture and commercialize products arising from the HPN217 program targeting BCMA, or HPN217 Products. Under the Development and Option Agreement, we will file an IND for HPN217 and conduct development activities pursuant to a mutually-agreed development plan, including conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217, in order for AbbVie to determine whether it wishes to exercise its option to take a worldwide, exclusive license to such HPN217 program.
 Under the Development and Option Agreement, AbbVie may exercise its license option at any time during a period commencing on the effective date of the agreement, and expiring after a specified period, following delivery by us of a specified data package arising from the first Phase 1/2 trial for the HPN217 Products. Following AbbVie’s exercise of its option, and except for completion of certain development activities by us under the development plan, AbbVie will be solely responsible, at its cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of HPN217 Products and any other HPN217 Products. AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for one HPN217 product, for at least one indication, for use in each Major Market (as defined in the Development and Option Agreement).
 AbbVie paid an upfront payment of $30 million and a development milestone payment of $50 million in June 2020 as we dosed our first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217 in April 2020. If AbbVie exercises its option, AbbVie will pay us an option exercise fee of $200 million.  Following option exercise, AbbVie will be required to make further payments to us of up to $230 million in the aggregate for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones for HPN217 Products. We will also receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of HPN217 Products at percentages ranging from the high single digits to the very low double digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable under the Development and Option Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the date of first commercial sale of each HPN217 Product, and ending on the later of expiration of all valid claims of specified licensed patents in such country, expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or ten years following first commercial sale of such HPN217 Product in such country. 
 The Development and Option Agreement will terminate upon the date of the expiration of all AbbVie’s royalty payment obligations in all countries, or upon expiration of the license option period and the failure of AbbVie to exercise its license option. The Development and Option Agreement may be terminated by either party immediately for the insolvency of the other party or on 90 days’ written notice for an uncured material breach of the Development and Option Agreement by the other party. AbbVie may also terminate the Development and Option Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis for any reason on 90 days’ written notice to us.
 Amended and Restated Discovery Collaboration Agreement with AbbVie Biotechnology
 On November 20, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Restated Collaboration Agreement, with AbbVie, which agreement amends and restates the Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement entered into between us and AbbVie, dated October 10, 2017 and amended April 3, 2019, or the Original Collaboration Agreement.  Pursuant to the Original Collaboration Agreement, we granted to AbbVie worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products that incorporate our proprietary TriTAC technology together with soluble TCRs provided by AbbVie that bind to targets accepted by the parties. Under the terms of the Original Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie had the right to designate up 
 15


to two targets for development of TriTAC constructs, which it selected in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, the worldwide, exclusive license granted to AbbVie under the Original Collaboration Agreement to develop and commercialize products that incorporate our proprietary Tri-specific T-cell Activating Construct, or TriTAC, platform technology together with soluble T cell receptors, or TCRs, provided by AbbVie has been expanded to cover products that incorporate antibodies provided by AbbVie or by us. The expansion of the collaboration also allows AbbVie to designate up to six additional targets, selected during a specified period following the effective date, to be the subject of activities under the collaboration. During a period of up to four years following the date of AbbVie’s designation of each target for the products, and confirmation of target availability, we and AbbVie will conduct certain research and discovery activities under a mutually agreed discovery and research plan in connection with the creation and evaluation of constructs comprising our proprietary TriTAC technology, in conjunction with the soluble TCR or antibody sequences directed at the agreed upon targets of interest. We may not, including through any third party, develop or commercialize any competing product that binds to any of the included targets. As was the case under the Original Collaboration Agreement, following the discovery phase, AbbVie will be solely responsible, at its cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the products that arise from the activities under the discovery plan. AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one such product directed to each target for which the discovery activities were completed in each Major Market (as defined in the Restated Collaboration Agreement).
 In addition to the upfront payment of $17 million already paid under the Original Collaboration Agreement, under the Restated Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $20 million for AbbVie’s right to select two additional targets and an option to select up to four further targets. AbbVie will be required to make payments to us, upon target selection, of $10 million for each target, up to four further targets selected by AbbVie. For each of the up to eight targets selected, we will receive up to $300 million in the aggregate for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones for licensed products indicated for human therapeutic or prophylactic use, totaling up to $2.4 billion in the aggregate, if such licensed products are successfully progressed against all-included targets and indications. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of licensed products at percentages in the mid-single digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable under the Restated Collaboration Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the date of first commercial sale of each product, and ending on the later of expiration of all valid claims of specified licensed patents in such country, expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country or ten years following first commercial sale of such product in such country.  If licensed products are developed and commercialized for diagnostic or veterinary use, or certain screening or monitoring uses, the parties have agreed to negotiate an appropriate reduction in the economic terms applicable to such non-therapeutic and prophylactic applications.
 The Restated Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the date of the expiration of all AbbVie’s royalty payment obligations in all countries.  The Restated Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party immediately for the insolvency of the other party or on 90 days’ written notice for an uncured material breach of such agreement by the other party.  AbbVie may also terminate the Restated Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a target-by-target or country-by-country basis for any reason on 30 days’ written notice to the Company. In addition, AbbVie may terminate the Restated Collaboration Agreement immediately in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis if AbbVie considers in good faith that there has been a failure of the discovery or development efforts with respect to such target, or that further development or commercialization of products directed to such target is not advisable as a result of a serious safety issue.
 License Agreement with Werewolf Therapeutics, Inc.
 In March 2018, we entered into an assignment and license agreement, or the Werewolf Agreement, with Werewolf Therapeutics, Inc., or Werewolf, a portfolio company of MPM Capital, Inc., a holder of more than 5% of our capital stock. Dr. Luke Evnin, a member of our Board until June 2020, is also the Chairman of the board of directors of Werewolf. Under the Werewolf Agreement, we assigned certain patents that relate to certain inducible polypeptides (and binding moiety for conditional activation of certain polypeptides) to Werewolf and granted to Werewolf a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicenseable license under certain other patents owned by us and relating to certain proteins, to make, use and commercialize products that are covered by such patents in the field of molecules comprising a certain polypeptide. Werewolf assigned certain patents to us relating to adoptive cell therapies and binding moieties for conditional activation of immunoglobulin and non-immunoglobulin molecules. Under the Werewolf Agreement, Werewolf paid us an upfront fee of $0.5 million. If Werewolf commercializes products covered by the licensed patents, then beginning on the first sale of such products, Werewolf will be obligated to pay to us a royalty on net sales of such products by Werewolf, its affiliates and licensees at a percentage in the low single digits, subject to an obligation to make a minimum annual royalty payment at an amount in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
 16


In December 2019, we and Werewolf amended the Werewolf Agreement by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Assignment and License Agreement, or the Amended Werewolf Agreement, to include the grant to Werewolf of an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain patents owned by us and relating to certain proteins, to make, use, and commercialize products that are covered by such patents in the field of molecules comprising a certain protein.  This license provides Werewolf with certain rights to enforce and defend these licensed patents. If Werewolf commercializes products covered by these licensed patents, then beginning on the first sale of such products, Werewolf will be obligated to pay to us a royalty on net sales of such products by Werewolf, its affiliates and licensees at a percentage in the low single digits, and this royalty cannot be added to any other royalty owed to us under the Amended Werewolf Agreement.  In addition, each party granted to the other a non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual license under certain other patents relating to a certain binding domain of a certain protein, to make, use, and commercialize products that are covered by such patents in a field defined by a certain type of molecule for each party. The Amended Werewolf Agreement also includes a mutual release of claims regarding certain patent prosecution matters.
 Royalties on net sales will be recognized when the underlying sales occur. No royalty revenue was recognized under the Werewolf Agreement as of December 31, 2020.
 Asset Transfer Agreement with Maverick Therapeutics, Inc. 
 In December 2016, we entered into an asset transfer agreement, or the Asset Transfer Agreement, with Maverick Therapeutics, Inc., or Maverick. Under the Asset Transfer Agreement, we transferred one provisional patent application (and any subsequently filed patent applications that claim priority to the provisional patent application) and certain know-how to Maverick solely for use in connection with a specific type of conditionally active T cell engagers having an activation mechanism that we believe is not used by the T cell engagers that are incorporated in the products that we are developing (such permitted use by Maverick, the Maverick Field), and Maverick assumed liabilities from us relating to this transferred intellectual property and other transferred assets. Maverick granted back to us a royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicenseable license under this transferred intellectual property for use in all fields outside of the Maverick Field, which include all fields in which we are developing products. We further granted Maverick royalty-free, exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to certain other patents that we own, in all cases solely for use in the Maverick Field. In consideration for our transfer and license of such intellectual property, Maverick issued a promissory note to us in the amount of $6.8 million, which we collected in full in January 2017, and all of its outstanding capital stock, which we then spun-off to our stockholders (such distribution, the “Distribution”). The Asset Transfer Agreement includes a covenant not to compete, which provides that we will not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize products in the Maverick Field until December 2020. The Asset Transfer Agreement is not terminable and all rights transferred or licensed by a party to the other party under the Asset Transfer Agreement are irrevocable. 
 We are involved in significant litigation with Maverick regarding a dispute relating to our ProTriTAC program that arose under the Asset Transfer Agreement. For more information, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
 Agreements with AGC Biologics, Inc. 
 In October 2015, we entered into the AGC License Agreement with AGC, pursuant to which AGC granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under its proprietary Chinese hamster EF-1 protein expression technology, or the CHEF1 Technology, which is used in connection with the manufacturing process for HPN424, HPN536 and our other current preclinical product candidates, or collectively, the Products, for use in connection with our development of the Products, including our clinical trials. Subsequently, in July 2016, we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement with AGC, or the Manufacturing Agreement, under which AGC conducts cGMP manufacturing of the Products utilizing the CHEF1 Technology. Under the terms of the AGC License Agreement, we have an option, exercisable for each Product, to be granted a non-exclusive license to use the CHEF1 Technology in connection with the commercialization of such Product for human therapeutics or diagnostics. If we exercise such option during a specified period, we will make a one-time upfront payment in the mid tens of thousands of dollars to AGC (solely in connection with the first Product) for such commercial license for the first Product, or if we exercise such commercial option after the expiration of such period, our commercial license will be subject to the payment of a higher option exercise fee. 
 We retain the right, at any time, to manufacture the Products using the CHEF1 Technology ourselves, or through an affiliate or third-party manufacturer for development purposes, and subject to exercising our commercial option, for commercialization purposes. 
 17


Under the terms of our agreements with AGC, so long as AGC is the exclusive manufacturer of our Products, we will not owe AGC any milestone or royalty payments to AGC under the AGC License Agreement for the use of the CHEF1 Technology. However, if AGC is no longer our exclusive manufacturer for the Products, and we still use the CHEF1 Technology, we will owe AGC specified development and regulatory milestones of up to $350,000 per Product, and a royalty on net sales of Products of less than 1%, payable for the longer of ten years from first commercial sale of such Product, or the expiration of the patent rights in the CHEF1 Technology covering such Product in the relevant country, subject to a reduction in the event of no patent coverage. If we are not using AGC as our exclusive manufacturer of a given Product, such that we owe a royalty to AGC, we have an option, exercisable at any time prior to the end of the first royalty period in which a royalty is due for such Product, to buy out our royalty obligations in lieu of an ongoing royalty payment, by making a one-time payment to AGC in a dollar amount in the mid-single digit millions. 
 The Manufacturing Agreement can be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, or in the event of insolvency. We have the right to terminate the Manufacturing Agreement or any portion of the services at any time on 60 business days’ notice, and AGC has the right to terminate the agreement on 60 business days’ notice if it reasonably concludes that the services are not scientifically or technically feasible despite its commercially reasonable efforts and after we and AGC attempt to resolve the scientific or technical problem in good faith. The AGC License Agreement expires on the later of the expiration of all licensed patents or our use of trade secrets relating to the CHEF1 Technology or manufacture of Products. The AGC License Agreement terminates immediately in the event of either party’s insolvency, and AGC may terminate the AGC License Agreement for our material breach on 30 days’ notice to us. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any GMP manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, our commercial products. We believe this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of new product candidates. 
 To date, we have obtained bulk drug substance, or BDS, for HPN424, HPN536 and HPN217 from a single-source third-party contract manufacturer, AGC. While any reduction or halt in supply of BDS from this contract manufacturer could limit our ability to develop our product candidates until a replacement contract manufacturer is found and qualified, we believe that we have sufficient BDS to support our current clinical trial programs. We have obtained final drug product for these product candidates from one of two engaged third-party contract manufacturers. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates and intend to put in place agreements under which our third-party contract manufacturers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of BDS and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development and commercial supply needs. 
 All of our TriTACs and ProTriTACs are or will be manufactured from a vial of a master cell bank of that product’s production cell line. We have or intend to have one master cell bank for each TriTAC and ProTriTAC that was or will be produced and tested in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, and applicable regulations. Each master cell bank is or will be stored in two independent locations, and we intend to produce working cell banks for each product candidate later in product development. It is possible that we could lose multiple cell banks from multiple locations and have our manufacturing severely impacted by the need to replace the cell banks. However, we believe we have adequate backup should any particular cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new immunotherapies that may become available in the future. 
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immuno-oncology treatments. There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech. 
 18


We face significant competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that target specific tumor-associated antigens using immune cells or other cytotoxic modalities. These generally include immune cell redirecting therapeutics (e.g., T cell engagers), adoptive cellular therapies (e.g., CAR-Ts), antibody drug conjugates, targeted radiopharmaceuticals, targeted immunotoxin and targeted cancer vaccines. 
 With respect to HPN424, we are aware of other competing PSMA-targeting clinical stage therapeutics, which include, but are not limited to: T cell engagers from Amgen Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; CAR-Ts from Poseida Therapeutics, Inc., Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. and Tmunity Therapeutics, Inc.; and radiopharmaceuticals from Endocyte Inc./Novartis AG and Bayer. 
 With respect to HPN536, we are aware of other competing MSLN-targeting clinical stage therapeutics, which include, but are not limited to: CAR-T from UPenn/Novartis AG, Atara Inc. and TCR2; antibody drug conjugates from Bayer AG and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; and other modalities from AbbVie Inc., Bayer AG and Selecta Biosciences Inc. 
 With respect to HPN217, we are aware of other competing BCMA-targeting clinical stage therapeutics, which include, but are not limited to: T cell engagers from Amgen Inc., Pfizer Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, TeneoBio, Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; CAR-Ts from Autolus Therapeutics PLC, bluebird bio, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Legend Biotech/Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Novartis AG, and Allogene Therapeutics; antibody drug conjugates from GlaxoSmithKline PLC and AstraZeneca/MedImmune LLC; and other modalities from Affimed N.V. and Unum Therapeutics Inc./Seattle Genetics Inc. 
 With respect to our earlier stage pipeline DLL3-targeting TriTAC product candidate, HPN328 we are aware of other competing DLL3-targeting clinical stage therapeutics. These include, but are not limited to: T cell engagers from Amgen Inc. and Boehringer Ingelheim; and CAR-T from Amgen Inc. and Boehringer Ingelheim; and Allogene Therapeutics.
 We are also currently developing a pipeline of ProTriTACs and other protease-activated therapeutics that face increasing competition from other biologic prodrug developers, which include, but are not limited to, Akrevia Therapeutics Inc., Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer AG, BioAtla, LLC, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., CytomX Therapeutics, Inc., Genentech, Inc., Nektar Therapeutics, Pandion Therapeutics, Inc., Revitope Oncology, Inc., Roche Holding AG and Seattle Genetics Inc. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The proprietary nature and protection of our platforms, product candidates and discovery programs, as well as our processes and know-how, are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for our TriTAC platform, binding domains and related TriTAC product candidates, as well as the proprietary technology in our ProTriTAC platform and any other inventions to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. For our product candidates, we generally pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of use and manufacture. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights in strategic areas, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We may also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. 
 19


To date, we have spent considerable effort securing intellectual property rights, including rights related to our TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms, binding domains and specific targets pertaining to our product candidates. Below is a summary of how we view our protections and ongoing prosecution efforts.  
 TriTAC Platform 
 For our TriTAC platform, as of December 31, 2020 we own one patent family directed to composition-of-matter coverage and method of use of our core TriTAC platform technology. This family includes one issued U.S. patent, one U.S. non-provisional patent application and over ten foreign application counterparts. The issued patent in this family is projected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection on our core TriTAC platform technology, as of December 31, 2020, we owned two patent families that relate to the CD3 and albumin binding domains of the TriTAC platform. Specifically, these two families are directed to composition-of-matter, method of use and sequence coverage to our anti-CD3 single-variable fragment, scFv, and anti-albumin single domain antibody, sdAb, binding domains. These patent families include four issued U.S. patents, two U.S. non-provisional patent applications and over twenty foreign application counterparts. The issued patents in these two patent families are projected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. 
 HPN424 
 For our lead TriTAC product candidate, HPN424, as of December 31, 2020, we owned [two] patent families directed to composition-of-matter coverage of HPN424, its PSMA binding domain and related molecules, as well as methods of use for prostate cancer. These patent families include two issued U.S. patents, two U.S. non-provisional patent applications and over twenty foreign application counterparts. The issued patents in these two patent families are projected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. In addition to these two patent families, our patents on our core TriTAC platform technology and our anti-CD3 and albumin binding domains, provide additional patent coverage on HPN424. 
 HPN536 
 For our second TriTAC product candidate, HPN536, as of December 31, 2020, we owned [two] patent families directed to composition-of-matter coverage of HPN536, its MSLN-binding domain and related molecules, as well as methods of use for cancers. These patent families include two issued U.S. patents, two U.S. non-provisional patent applications and over twenty foreign application counterparts. The issued patents in these two patent families are projected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. In addition to these two patent families, our patents on our core TriTAC platform technology and our anti-CD3 and albumin binding domains provide additional patent coverage on HPN536. 
 HPN217 
 For our pipeline BCMA-Targeting TriTAC product candidate HPN217, as of December 31, 2020, we owned [two] patent families directed to composition-of-matter coverage of HPN217, its BCMA binding domain and related molecules, as well as methods of use for cancers. These patent families include three U.S. non-provisional patent applications over fifty foreign application counterparts . Any patents issuing from these two patent families are projected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. In addition to these two patent families, our patents on our anti-CD3 and albumin binding domains provide additional patent coverage on HPN217. 
 HPN328 
 For our pipeline DLL3-targeting TriTAC, HPN328, as of December 31, 2020, we owned one patent family directed to composition-of-matter coverage of this TriTAC, its DLL3 binding domain and related molecules, as well as methods of use for cancers. These patent families include one issued U.S. patent, one U.S. non-provisional patent application and one PCT international application. The issued patent from this family is projected to expire in 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. In addition to these two patent families, our patents on our anti-CD3 and albumin binding domains provide additional patent coverage on this TriTAC. 
 ProTriTAC Platform 
 Our patent portfolio for our ProTriTAC platform is at an early stage, with no issued patents as of December 31, 2020, and includes ten patent families directed to composition-of-matter coverage of the ProTriTAC binding moieties, applications in various protein and cellular therapy formats and methods of use thereof. These patent families include three U.S. non-provisional patent applications, four PCT international applications, three non-expired U.S. provisional patent applications and over ten foreign application counterparts. Any patents issuing from these ten patent families are projected to expire in 2039 or 2040, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. 
 20


We are involved in a significant litigation with Maverick Therapeutics, Inc. regarding an intellectual property-based dispute relating to our ProTriTAC program. For more information, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against any third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. While we plan to seek patent term extensions on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted and, if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. We may therefore not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. 
 The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development, commercial strategies, drugs or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

Government Regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as equivalent regulatory authorities in countries outside the U.S., extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. Moreover, compliance with government regulations governing personal information and information security requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biologics Regulation 
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug or biologic product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries. 
 22


For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 BLA Submission and Review 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 23


If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 A regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation is intended to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedited review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (i) the drug qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through: the submission of clinical evidence, preclinical studies, clinical trials, patient registries or other sources of real world evidence such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval. 
 24


Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25


 
• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Regulation of Companion Diagnostic Tests 
 We expect that our product candidates may require use of a diagnostic to identify appropriate patient population. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for use with our product candidates will utilize the PMA pathway. 
 PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and therapeutic are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. 
 26


Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
 The ACA includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products.
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.  
 Other Healthcare, Data Privacy and Security Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare and data privacy as well as information security regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, HIPAA and similar foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency, privacy and information security laws. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. 
 Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. 
 27


HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearing houses and health plans, and individuals and entities that provide services on their behalf that involves individually identifiable health information, known as business associates and their subcontractors that use, disclose, access or otherwise process individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.
 We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, including those governing the privacy and security of personal information (including key-coded data and health information), which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements will comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. European data protection laws, such as the GDPR, also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Further, the GDPR authorizes the imposition of penalties (such as restrictions or prohibitions on personal data processing) and large fines for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process or control compared to prior EU law, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR and similar data protection laws, which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business. Likewise, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which has been characterized as the first “GDPR-like” privacy statute to be enacted in the United States. Although the CCPA exempts certain data processed in the context of clinical trials, the CCPA, to the extent applicable to our business and operations, may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to the personal information we maintain about California residents. In any event, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable information security or privacy laws in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal, state and foreign enforcement bodies have increased their scrutiny of biotechnology companies, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions, fines, penalties and settlements in the industry.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.

For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. 
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. No regulatory authority has granted approval for a personalized cancer immunotherapy based on a vaccine approach, and there is no model for reimbursement of this type of product. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
 The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. For example, the Tax Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with ACA’s requirement to carry health insurance, known as the “individual mandate”, effective January 1, 2019. Since the enactment of the Tax Act, there have been additional amendments to certain provisions of the ACA. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unknown when a decision will be made. Further, although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 2021 unless additional action is taken by Congress. 
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.  At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price

reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the U.S. District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) and the COVID-19 pandemic.
