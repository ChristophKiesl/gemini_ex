ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction
 
Roth CH Acquisition II Co. (the “Company”) is a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 13, 2019. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to herein as our “initial business combination.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular geographic region or industry, although we intend to focus on the business services, consumer, healthcare, technology, wellness or sustainability sectors.
 
On December 15, 2020, the Company consummated the IPO of 11,500,000 units (the “Units”), including 1,500,000 issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters in the IPO of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”), and one-half of one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling the holder of each whole Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000.
 
On December 15, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with initial stockholders of the Company of 275,000 units (the “Private Units”), at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,750,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold as part of the public units in the IPO except that the warrants underlying the Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units.
 
As of December 15, 2020, a total of $115,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than to pay our income or other tax obligations until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the Company’s failure to consummate a business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, and (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the ability of holders of the Company’s public shares to seek redemption in connection with the Company’s initial business combination or the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity.
 
Prospective Initial Business Combination
 
On February 15, 2021, the Company entered into a mutually exclusive non-binding letter of intent (the “Letter of Intent”) with a target company (“Target Company”) for a potential business combination which would qualify as our initial business combination.
 
Under the terms of the Letter of Intent, the Company and Target Company intend to enter into a definitive agreement pursuant to which the Company and Target Company would combine, with the former equity holders of both entities (following the completion of the business combination) holding equity in the combined publicly listed company. The completion of the business combination is subject to the completion of due diligence to the Company’s satisfaction, the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation and satisfaction of the conditions contained therein, including (i) completion of any required stock exchange and regulatory review and (ii) approval of the transaction by the Company’s stockholders and the Target Company’s stockholders. Accordingly, no assurances can be made by the Company or Target Company that the parties will successfully negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement, or that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeframe currently contemplated, or at all.

If a definitive agreement is entered into in connection with the proposed business combination, the Company will prepare a proxy statement/prospectus (the “Company proxy statement/prospectus”) to be filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and mailed to its stockholders. The Company urges its investors and other interested persons to read, when available, the Company proxy statement/prospectus, as well as other documents filed with the SEC, because these documents will contain important information about the proposed business combination.
 
The Company and its directors, executive officers and other members of management and employees, under SEC rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of the Company stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination. Investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names, affiliations and interests of the Company’s directors and officers. Information regarding the persons who may, under SEC rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies to the Company’s stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination will be set forth in the Company proxy statement/prospectus for the proposed business combination when available. Information concerning the interests of the Company’s participants in the solicitation, which may, in some cases, be different than those of the Company’s equity holders generally, will be set forth in the Company proxy statement/prospectus relating to the proposed business combination when it becomes available.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have five executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
