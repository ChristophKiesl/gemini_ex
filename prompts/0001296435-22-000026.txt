Item 1.    Business
Overview
Neenah is a specialty materials company organized into two primary businesses: a performance-based technical products business and a premium fine paper and packaging business.
Our technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation, water and other filter media and durable, saturated, and coated substrates for a variety of end markets. We focus on categories where we believe we are, or can be, a market leader. These categories include filtration media for transportation, water and other end use applications, backings for specialty tapes and abrasives, release liners, digital transfer papers, performance labels and other custom engineered materials. Our products are typically used in high performance applications where our customers require specific standards and qualifications. Our dedicated technical products manufacturing facilities are located in Weidach and Bruckmühl, Germany, Eerbeek, Netherlands, Andoain, Spain, Bolton, England, Queretaro, Mexico, Munising, Michigan, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
Our fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing, packaging, and other high-end specialty papers predominantly in North America. Our products include some of the most recognized and preferred brands in North America, where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories. Often these papers are characterized by distinctive finishing, colors, textures and coating. We sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors, as well as through converters, major national retailers and specialty businesses. Our dedicated fine paper and packaging manufacturing facilities are located in Whiting and Neenah, Wisconsin, and Great Barrington, Massachusetts.
In addition, certain products of both businesses are manufactured in shared facilities located in Brownville and Lowville, New York, and Quakertown, Pennsylvania. For a description of our facilities, see Item 2, "Properties."
History of the Businesses
Neenah was incorporated in April 2004 in contemplation of the spin-off by Kimberly-Clark Corporation ("Kimberly-Clark") of its technical products and fine paper businesses in the United States and its Canadian pulp business (collectively, the "Pulp and Paper Business"). We had no material assets or activities until Kimberly-Clark's transfer to us of the Pulp and Paper business on November 30, 2004. On that date, Kimberly-Clark completed the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock to the stockholders of Kimberly-Clark.
Former Pulp Operations.  Our former pulp operations consisted of mills located in Terrace Bay, Ontario and Pictou, Nova Scotia and approximately 975,000 acres of related woodlands. We disposed of these mills and woodlands in a series of transactions from 2006 through 2010. 
Technical Products.  The Munising, Michigan mill was purchased by Kimberly-Clark in 1952. Subsequent to the purchase, the mill was converted to produce durable, saturated and coated papers for sale and use in a variety of industrial applications for our technical products business. 
In October 2006, we purchased the outstanding interests of FiberMark Services GmbH & Co. KG and the outstanding interests of FiberMark Beteiligungs GmbH (collectively "Neenah Germany"). At acquisition, the Neenah Germany assets consisted of three mills located in Weidach, Bruckmühl and Lahnstein, Germany. In October 2015, we sold the Lahnstein mill to the Kajo Neukirchen Group. The remaining mills produce a wide range of products, including transportation filter media, masking and other tapes, abrasive backings, and specialized printing and coating substrates.
In July 2014, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of Crane Technical Materials, Inc. from Crane & Co., Inc. The acquired business provides performance-oriented wet laid nonwoven media for water filtration end markets as well as environmental, energy and industrial uses. The business has two manufacturing facilities in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
In November 2017, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of Neenah Coldenhove B.V. ("Neenah Coldenhove"). The acquired business is a specialty materials manufacturer with a leading position in digital transfer media and other technical products. The business has one manufacturing facility in Eerbeek, Netherlands.
In April 2021, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of Global Release Liners, S.L. (“Itasa”). Itasa, through its subsidiaries, is a leading global coater and converter of release liners used in hygiene, tapes, industrial, labels, composites, and various other end markets. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Business Acquisition."
In June 2021, our Board of Directors approved the permanent closure of the manufacturing facility in Appleton, Wisconsin. As of September 30, 2021, the closure of the facility was substantially complete, and we initiated a process to market it for sale. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Assets Held For Sale and Impairment and Asset Restructuring Costs."
Fine Paper and Packaging.  The fine paper and packaging business was incorporated in 1885 as Neenah Paper Company, which initially operated a single paper mill in Neenah, Wisconsin. Kimberly-Clark acquired the mill in 1956. In 1981, Kimberly-Clark purchased an additional mill located in Whiting, Wisconsin and thereafter the capacity of the fine paper and packaging business has expanded by installing two paper machines at the Whiting mill and completing a major expansion of the Neenah facility with the installation of a paper machine, and constructing a finishing center, customer service center and an expanded distribution center. 
In the first of the series of consolidating acquisitions, in March 2007, we acquired the assets and brands of Neenah Paper FR, LLC ("Fox River"). In January 2012, we purchased certain premium fine paper brands and other assets from Wausau Paper Mills, LLC, a subsidiary of Wausau Paper Corp. ("Wausau") and in January 2013, we purchased certain premium business paper brands from the Southworth Company ("Southworth"). 
In August 2017, we purchased a laminating asset in Great Barrington, Massachusetts to support continued growth in our premium packaging business.
Shared Facilities.  In August 2015, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of ASP FiberMark, LLC ("FiberMark"). We added specialty coating and finishing capabilities with this acquisition, particularly in luxury packaging and technical products. The results of operations and assets related to FiberMark are reflected in each of our business segments. These mills are located in Brownville and Lowville, New York, Quakertown, Pennsylvania and Bolton, England.

Other. The fine paper and packaging business also produces and sells other specialty papers such as translucent papers, art papers, papers for optical scanning, and other specialized applications.
There were no significant government contracts to disclose in either segment.
Markets and Customers
Technical Products.  The technical products business sells its products globally to other manufacturers who convert our product for sale into product categories generally used as base materials in the following applications: filtration, component backing materials for manufactured products such as tape and abrasives, and other specialized product uses such as graphics and identification. Customers typically convert and transform base papers and film into finished rolls and sheets by adding adhesives, coatings, and finishes. These transformed products are then sold to end-users.
Our products are generally used in markets that are directly affected by economic business cycles. Certain market segments such as digital transfer papers used in small/home office and consumer applications are relatively stable. Most products are performance-based and require extended qualification by customers; however, certain categories may also be subject to price competition and the substitution of lower cost substrates for some less demanding applications.
The technical products business relies on a team of direct sales representatives and customer service representatives to market and sell a large majority of its sales volume directly to customers and converters.
The technical products business has more than 1,000 customers worldwide. The distribution of sales in 2021 was 45 percent in Europe, 38 percent in North America, and 17 percent in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  We believe our fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing, packaging, and other high-end specialty papers predominantly in North America. These products are used in high-end commercial printing services, corporate identity packages, and advertising collateral. Our premium packaging business includes products such as food and beverage labels and high-end packaging materials such as folding cartons and box wrap used for luxury retail goods. In addition, we produce wide format applications used for display graphics and indoor/outdoor signage. Bright papers are generally used by consumers for flyers, direct mail and packaging.
The fine paper and packaging business has over 550 customers worldwide. The fine paper and packaging business sells its products in a variety of channels including authorized paper distributors, converters, major national retailers, specialty business converters, and direct to end-users. Sales to distributors account for approximately 40 percent of net sales in the fine paper and packaging business. During 2021, approximately 10 percent of the net sales of our fine paper and packaging business were exported to markets outside North America.
Concentration.  For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, sales to the technical products business' largest customer represented approximately 9 percent, 9 percent, and 8 percent of consolidated net sales, respectively, and approximately 14 percent,16 percent, and 15    percent of net sales for the technical products segment, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 sales to the largest customer of fine paper and packaging business represented approximately 6 percent, 6 percent, and 8 percent of consolidated net sales, respectively, and approximately 17 percent for the year ended December 31, 2021 and approximately 18 percent of net sales of the fine paper and packaging business for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We practice limited sales distribution to improve our ability to control the marketing of our products. Although a complete loss of these customers would cause a temporary decline in the respective business' sales volume, we believe the decline could be partially offset by expanding sales to existing customers, and further offset over a several month period with the addition of new customers.
Competition
Technical Products.  Our technical products business competes in global markets with a number of large multinational competitors, including Ahlstrom-Munksjö, Hollingsworth & Vose Company, Mondi plc, and Loparex LLC. It also competes in some, but not all, of these segments with smaller regional manufacturers, such as Monadnock Paper Mills, Inc. and Potsdam Specialty Paper, Inc. We believe the bases of competition in most of these categories are the ability to design and develop customized product features to meet customer performance specifications while maintaining quality, customer service, and a competitive price. We believe our research and development program gives us an advantage in customizing base papers and developing advanced filter media to meet customer needs.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  Our fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing and other 
high-end specialty papers in North America. Our fine paper and packaging business also competes in the premium segment 
of the uncoated free sheet market. The fine paper and packaging business competes primarily in North America with Mohawk and Monadnock Paper Mills. We believe the primary bases of competition for premium fine papers are product quality, customer service, product availability, promotional support, color and texture variety, and brand recognition. Price also can be a factor particularly for lower quality printing applications for which our papers may compete with opaque and offset papers. We have and will continue to invest in advertising and other programs aimed at graphic designers, printers and corporate end-users in order to maintain a high level of brand awareness and to communicate the advantages of using our products
Our premium packaging business is focused on high-end packaging needs in end market verticals like beauty products, spirits and retail. Like our premium fine paper business, the primary bases of competition are similarly product quality, customer service, product availability, color and texture variety, and brand recognition. Premium packaging is primarily a North American business, but we also sell to customers in Asia and other markets outside the U.S. We believe the premium packaging market to be highly fragmented, with multiple competitors, many of which produce premium packaging products as a small subset of larger packaging operations.

See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Business Segment and Geographic Information," for information with respect to net sales, operating income and long-lived assets by business segment and location.
Neenah Operating System
The Neenah Operating System (NOS) is an enterprise-wide framework of standardized principles, practices and tools that we introduced in 2020 with a goal to harmonize the way we work, with employee safety always preeminent, to drive increased customer value, continuous improvement and efficiency. The NOS is based on A3 Thinking and the "Plan, Do, Check, Act" (PDCA) process and focuses on using collaborative team effort to improve performance by systematically removing waste and reducing variation. Our NOS philosophy focuses on aligning our internal processes to enhance customer value while also driving continuous improvement, efficiency, growth and respect for our people, our clients and our communities. NOS provides a framework to facilitate enterprise-wide cultural change by helping to foster a more unified mindset where all are consistently empowered to problem-solve and make the changes needed to help support and accelerate our growth strategy. We began implementation in October 2020 at our Whiting, Wisconsin and Weidach, Germany facilities. In August 2021, we began replicating the process across all our mills. It is a multi-year program, with full implementation by 2025, with a goal to make continuous improvements daily, including initiatives to create a ZERO safety incident culture and drive business value through relentless cost optimization and customer service.
Seasonality
Technical Products.  In general, sales and operating income for the technical products business historically have been relatively stronger in the first half of the year with reductions in the third quarter due to reduced customer converting schedules and in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in year-end inventory levels by our customers. The order flow for the technical products business is subject to seasonal peaks for several of its products, such as the larger volume grades of specialty tape, abrasives, premask, and label stock used primarily in the downstream finished goods manufacturing process. To assure timely shipments during these seasonal peaks, the technical products business provides certain customers with finished goods inventory on consignment. The technical products business periodically experiences periods where order entry levels surge, and order backlogs can increase substantially. Raw materials are purchased and manufacturing schedules are planned based on customer forecasts, current market conditions and individual orders for custom products. 
Fine Paper and Packaging.  The fine paper and packaging business has historically not experienced seasonality. Orders for stock products are typically shipped within two days, while custom orders are shipped within two to three weeks of receipt. Raw material purchases and manufacturing schedules are planned based on a combination of historical trends, customer forecasts and current market conditions. 
The operating results for both of our businesses are influenced by the timing of our annual maintenance downs, which are generally scheduled in the third quarter.
Resources
Raw Materials
Technical Products.  Softwood pulp, specialty pulps and fibers, and latex are the primary raw materials consumed by our technical products business that are purchased from various external suppliers. We believe that all of the raw materials for our technical products operations, except for certain specialty latex grades and specialty pulps, are readily available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not cause a shutdown of our manufacturing operations.
Our technical products business acquires all of its specialized pulp requirements from two global suppliers and certain critical specialty latex grades from four suppliers. In general, these supply arrangements are covered by formal contracts, and represent multi-year business relationships that have historically been sufficient to meet our needs. We expect these relationships to continue to operate in a satisfactory manner in the future. In the event of an interruption of production at any one supplier, we believe that each of these suppliers individually would be able to satisfy our short-term requirements for specialized pulp or specialty latex. During 2021, we experienced some short-term disruptions in the global supply chain. In the event of a long-term disruption in our supply of specialized pulp or specialty latex, we believe we would be able to substitute other pulp grades or other latex grades that would allow us to meet required product performance characteristics and incur a limited disruption in our production. As a result, we do not believe that the substitution of such alternative pulp or latex grades would have a material effect on our operations.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  Hardwood pulp is the primary raw material used to produce products of the fine paper and packaging business. Other significant raw material inputs in the production of fine paper and packaging products include 
softwood pulp, recycled fiber, cotton fiber, dyes and fillers. The fine paper and packaging business purchases all of its raw materials externally. We believe that all of the raw materials for our fine paper and packaging operations are readily available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not cause a shutdown of our manufacturing operations.
Working Capital
Technical Products.  The technical products business maintains approximately 25 to 30 days of raw materials and supplies inventories to support its manufacturing operations and approximately 25 to 30 days of finished goods inventory to support customer orders for its products. Sales terms in the technical products business vary depending on the type of product sold and customer category. In general, sales are collected in approximately 50 to 60 days, with extended credit terms for certain international customers. Supplier invoices are paid within 30 to 40 days.
Fine Paper and Packaging.  The fine paper and packaging business maintains approximately 15 to 20 days of raw material inventories to support its paper making operations and historically has maintained about 35 to 60 days of finished goods inventory to fill customer orders. Finished good inventory dropped to 35 from 45 days during the second half of 2021 as a result of challenges from the on-going supply chain shortages. Fine paper and packaging sales terms range between 20 and 30 days with discounts of up to 2 percent for customer payments, with discounts of 1 percent and 20-day terms used most often. Extended credit terms are offered to customers consistent with certain local markets. Supplier invoices are typically paid within 50 days.
Energy and Water
The equipment used to manufacture the products of our technical products and fine paper and packaging businesses uses significant amounts of energy, primarily electricity, natural gas, oil and (to a limited extent) coal. We have the ability to generate substantially all of our electrical energy at the Munising mill and approximately 30 percent of the electrical energy at our mill in Bruckmühl, Germany. We also purchase electrical energy from external sources, including electricity generated from renewable sources.
Availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future, but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on changes in demand and other factors.
An adequate supply of water is needed to manufacture our products. We believe that there is an adequate supply of water for this purpose at each of our manufacturing locations.
Research and Development
Our technical products business maintains research and development laboratories in Feldkirchen-Westerham, Germany, Eerbeek, Netherlands, Munising, Michigan, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Andoain, Spain and Queretaro, Mexico to support its strategy of developing new products and technologies, and to support growth in its existing product lines and other strategically important markets. We have continually invested in product research and development with spending of $8.3 million in 2021, $7.6 million in 2020, and $8.7 million in 2019.
Intellectual Property
We own more than 100 granted patents and have multiple pending patent applications in the United States, Canada, Europe and certain other countries covering digital transfer paper, abrasives, filtration and medical packaging, and other paper application and media processing. We also own more than 150 trademarks with registrations in approximately 80 countries. Our digital transfer patents have contributed to establishing the technical products business as a leading global supplier of digital transfer papers through our highly recognized JET-PRO®, JET-OPAQUE®, TECHNI-PRINT®, LASER-1-OPAQUE® and IMAGE CLIP® brands. We add even more depth and strength to our technical products portfolio with the well-recognized dye-sublimation JETCOL®, JET-X® and XTREME® brands, as well as our TEXCOL™ brand, which enables industrial transfer on natural substrates, supported by a pending patent. The KIMDURA® and MUNISING LP® trademarks have also made a significant contribution to the marketing of synthetic film and clean room papers for our 
technical products business. In the Abrasives category, the DURAFLAT® trademark has helped Neenah expand its presence into more durable, heavier weight backers.
For more than 100 years, Neenah’s fine paper and packaging business has built its market leading reputation on creating and manufacturing trademarked brands for premium writing, text, cover, digital, packaging, and specialty needs. The Neenah signature portfolio includes innovative, market leading brands such as CLASSIC® (including CLASSIC CREST®, CLASSIC® Linen, CLASSIC® Laid, CLASSIC COLUMNS®, CLASSIC® Stipple, CLASSIC® Techweave and CLASSIC® Cotton), ASTROBRIGHTS®, ENVIRONMENT®, ROYAL SUNDANCE®, UV/ULTRA®II, TOUCHE®, NEENAH® Cotton, SOUTHWORTH® and many more. Our fine paper and packaging business provides unique and sustainable packaging papers, as well as custom solutions for premium packaging needs. With brands that stand for quality and consistency, such as NEENAH® Folding Board, NEENAH® Box Wrap, ESTATE LABEL®, BELLA® Label and NEENAH IMAGEMAX® Paper Card, our fine paper and packaging business enables leading brands to deliver on their promise. The business accordingly maintains a well-rounded and respected portfolio of brands that position Neenah as an industry leader, setting standards for quality, consistency, and dependability.
Neenah also has significant trademarks recognized in both the publishing and packaging markets, including SKIVERTEX®, PELLAQ®, CORVON®, SENZO® and KIVAR®. 
The GESSNER® trademark similarly plays an important role in the marketing of Neenah’s filtration product lines for transportation filtration. To broaden our filtration footprint, we have added the NEENAHPURE® and NEENAHGUARD® product lines for HVAC/Air Purification and Face Mask media. The NEENAHSILENCE® trademark represents our well-established products for the acoustic market.

rights. See also “Human Capital” and “Environmental, Health and Safety Matters” below.
Additional information regarding our ESG programs and initiatives is available in the Sustainability section of our website
at www.neenah.com/sustainability. Information on our website, including our Corporate Sustainability Report or sections
thereof, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
Human Capital
Our vision is to be a company known for manufacturing growth, for our customers, end-users, shareholders, and employees. Our talent strategy focuses on accelerating growth for our global employees by fostering a culture of possibility and cultivating the right people in the right roles with the right skills at the right time. We're doing this by continually evolving how we attract, engage, grow and reward our people.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,493 regular full-time employees, of whom 952 hourly and 523 salaried employees were located in North America, 648 hourly and 370 salaried employees were located in Europe. 
All of the Company's U.S. hourly union employees (690 at December 31, 2021) are represented by the United Steelworkers Union (the "USW"). Certain employees of Neenah Germany are eligible to be represented by the Mining, Chemicals and Energy Trade Union, Industriegewerkschaft Bergbau, Chemie and Energie (the "IG BCE"). The IG BCE and a national trade association representing all employers in the industry signed a collective bargaining agreement covering union employees of Neenah Germany that expires in September 2022. Under German law union membership is voluntary and does not need to be disclosed to the Company. As a result, the number of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement cannot be determined. In Spain and Mexico, most of our employees are eligible to be represented by the local workers' unions: Confederacion Sindical de Comisiones Obreras ("CCOO") and Langile Abertzaalen Batzordeak ("LAB") in Spain; and Federacion de Trabajadores del Estado de Queretaro ("CTM") in Mexico. Under local laws, union membership is voluntary and does not need to be disclosed to the Company. In Netherlands, most of our employees are eligible to be represented by the Christelijke Nationale Vakbond ("CNV") and the Federatie Nederlandse Vakvereniging ("FNV"). Under Netherlands law, union membership is voluntary and does not need to be disclosed to the Company.
As of December 31, 2021, 873 employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire in the next twelve months, not including the employees covered by the collective bargaining arrangements with the CNV and FNV. 
We believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and do not expect the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements to have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments, Contingencies, and Legal Matters — Employees and Labor Relations."
Safety
First among our Core Values is “Safety Above All: We place the health and well-being of each other above everything else.” We strive to reflect this Core Value and integrate it in everything we do and have launched our NOS to help us deliver meaningful value, and most importantly, robust safety systems for our employees. All facilities have safety management systems to continuously review and improve employee safety and regulatory compliance. This includes routine workplace safety audits, employee participation in safety meetings and training, and active safety committees. Additionally, employees are encouraged to identify and report workplace conditions that could lead to an injury.
COVID-19
Our commitment to safety remained evident throughout 2021, as we further developed our protocols and action plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19” or the "pandemic") to help support our employees around the globe. Some of the key actions taken included the following:
•Providing all hourly employees with additional paid sick days until the vaccine was made available;
•Encouraging and providing employees with the flexibility to work from home;
•Adjusting attendance and sick leave policies to encourage those who are symptomatic, sick or who have been exposed to others with COVID-19 or COVID-19 symptoms to stay home;
•Conducting regular meetings to review the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including ongoing updates to our health and safety protocols and procedures to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposures;
•Establishing social distancing procedures for employees who need to be onsite;
•Providing additional cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment;
•Requiring employees to wear masks in all locations deemed necessary in accordance with local laws; and
•Limiting all non-essential travel for all employees.
All of our facilities manufacture products deemed essential to the critical infrastructure. As a result, in 2021 all of our production sites continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to building and developing a diverse workforce and are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We encourage applications from veterans, minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. We take pride in our policies that provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified applicants, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, protected veteran or disabled status, or genetic information.
Neenah has also established Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") that connect employees through shared identity or affinity. These groups are designed to provide networking opportunities for employees and create direct lines of communication between ERGs and leadership to address concerns, mitigate risks, and solve problems.
Training and Development
We recently launched a refreshed, consistent and simplified platform for talent management called grow@Neenah that helps us set objectives, create a culture of ongoing feedback, differentiate and reward individual performance, and create global learning and development opportunities. 
We also believe in recognizing our progress and celebrating success throughout our journey. We look for opportunities to identify our company values in action, reinforcing the behaviors we want people to display. We are also migrating to an incentive model that allows for more meaningful reward opportunities based on individual contributions and company performance.
Employee Benefits and Well-Being Programs
We offer comprehensive benefits and well-being programs that support our employees' physical, financial, and emotional health and wellness. Our tools and resources include preventative services, fitness activities, counseling and educational resources, financial support as well as comprehensive medical, dental and vision coverage. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. We believe our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to ensure compliance with, these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. Except for certain orders issued by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies with which we believe we are in compliance and which we believe are immaterial to our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, we are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health and safety matters.
Greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions have increasingly become the subject of political and regulatory focus. Concern over potential climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. In addition to certain federal proposals in the United States to regulate GHG emissions, Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and all the states in which we operate are currently considering GHG legislation or regulations, either individually and/or as part of regional initiatives. While not all such proposals will become law, it is likely that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices, requiring operational or equipment modifications to reduce emissions and creating costs to comply with regulations or to mitigate the financial consequences of such compliance.
As a company, we work to minimize the amount of fresh water we use at our manufacturing facilities and to recycle water within a facility as much as practically possible, all while maintaining stringent quality requirements. Due to the high quality achieved through efficient water treatment systems, our mills have the unique opportunity of being able to recycle and reuse fully-treated effluent back into our process to minimize fresh water draws. Furthermore, our processes are designed to return the water used in manufacturing at a quality level that does not negatively impact the receiving environment.
While we have incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, we believe that our future cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, and our exposure to liability for environmental, health and safety claims will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, new legislation to limit GHG emissions or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us (including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Our anticipated capital expenditures for environmental projects are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
