Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 We are a global company that delivers innovative, advanced high-performance networking technologies and Internet connected products to consumers, businesses, and service providers. We operate and report in two segments: Connected Home, and Small and Medium Business (“SMB”). The Connected Home segment is focused on consumers and consists of high-performance, dependable and easy-to-use WiFi internet networking solutions such as WiFi mesh systems, routers, 4G/5G mobile products, smart devices and value added services, offering consumers cyber security, parental controls, extended warranty and support for their home networks and products. The SMB segment is focused on home based, small and medium-sized businesses consisting of business networking, wireless LAN, storage, security solutions and valued added services, such as remote Cloud management and support bringing enterprise-class functionality to small and medium-sized businesses at an affordable price. We conduct business across three geographic territories: Americas; Europe, Middle-East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).
 On February 6, 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors had unanimously approved the pursuit of a separation of our smart camera business, Arlo, from NETGEAR (the “Separation”) to be effected by way of an initial public offering ("IPO") and spin-off ("the Spin-Off"). On December 31, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of Arlo Technologies, Inc. (“Arlo”), a majority owned subsidiary and reporting segment of NETGEAR at the time. Arlo’s historical financial results for periods prior to the Spin-Off are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for the periods presented. For further details, refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our website address is www.netgear.com.
 In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we generated net revenue of $1.26 billion, $998.8 million, and $1.06 billion, respectively.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and work force participation and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic initially impacted our supply chain partners, lowering finished good receipts by approximately 30% compared to planned receipts in the first quarter of 2020. At the same time, we saw a significant increase in airfreight rates to transport supply as a result of reduced capacity by carriers. Starting in March 2020, the spread of the pandemic to the U.S. and mainland Europe resulted in a surge in demand for Connected Home products as consumers responded to work from home and shelter-in-place measures. This surge in demand continued throughout 2020 and contributed to Connected Home net revenue growth of 41.6%, compared to the prior year. By contrast, demand for SMB products began to weaken as businesses faced closures and reacted to the uncertainty caused by 
 3


the pandemic. Demand for SMB products continued to remain challenged until the third fiscal quarter of 2020, resulting in an overall decrease of 13.8% in SMB net revenue, compared to the prior year.

        Commencing early in the first quarter of 2020, we enabled our crisis management team and put in place travel restrictions initially to/from Mainland China and Hong Kong, and subsequently restricted all international travel, while limiting domestic travel to essential travel in order to protect the health and well-being of our workforce and prevent the spread of the virus. In the middle of March 2020, the majority of our offices worldwide had enacted shelter-in-place measures, with employees being mandated to work from home. In addition, as part of our community outreach efforts, we donated a significant number of mobile hotspots to school districts in the U.S. for student use. The majority of our customers have continued to operate throughout the pandemic, adapting their operating models to the changing conditions with significant disruptions heretofore limited to the value-added resellers ("VARs") channel, through which we fulfill a significant portion of SMB demand.
 Markets
 Our mission is to be the innovative leader in connecting the world to the internet. Our goal includes being the provider of industry-leading networking and smart connected products for consumers, businesses, and service providers. There are a number of factors that are driving today's demand for products within these markets. The ever-growing number of internet connected devices, such as smart phones, Smart TV’s laptops, tablets and the advent of Smart Home and Internet-of-Things devices has increased the need for more robust networking solutions.  Application use cases relying on internet connectivity that demand high performance, dependable and secure WiFi continue to increase driven by shifts in consumer behavior and technological advancements, including the shift to content and video streaming, online gaming, work from home, fitness from home and schooling from home. Increasing incidences of cyber security threats and attacks continue to increase the need for devices connected to the network to be free from vulnerability, leading to an increase in the demand for our cyber security services. The internet has enabled information and resource sharing via both local area networks, and more broadly via the internet. To take advantage of complex applications, advanced communication capabilities and rich multimedia content, internet connections are being upgraded by deploying high-speed broadband access technologies. As a result, the need and desire for more convenience, speed, coverage range, security and reliability of an in-home Wi-Fi network as well as mobile cellular networks has become a greater priority among households as well as businesses.
 Consumers, small businesses and service providers demand a complete set of wired and wireless networking as well as broadband products that are tailored to their specific needs and budgets, while incorporating the latest networking technologies. Although end users desire the continual introduction of new advanced technologies, they often lack technical knowledge and resources. Therefore, 'plug-and-play', easy-to-install and seamless App experience is the expected norm. We have also observed that this audience prefers the convenience of obtaining a networking solution from a single company and we have seen that they tend to be loyal purchasers of a brand with which they have had a good experience. Purchasing decisions in these markets are driven by the affordability and reliability of the products and services. To provide reliable, easy-to-use products and services at an attractive price, we believe a successful supplier must have a company-wide focus on the unique requirements of these markets, operational discipline and a cost-efficient infrastructure with processes that allow for efficient product development, manufacturing and distribution.
 Sales Channels
 We sell our products through multiple sales channels worldwide, including wholesale distributors, traditional and online retailers, direct market resellers ("DMRs"), VARs, broadband service providers and online at www.netgear.com.
 Wholesale Distribution. Our distribution channel supplies our products to retailers, e-commerce resellers, DMRs, VARs and broadband service providers. We sell directly to our distributors, the largest of which are Ingram Micro, Inc., D&H Distributing Company and Tech Data Corporation.
 Retailers. Our retail channel primarily supplies products that are sold into the consumer market. However, increasingly we are seeing products designed for small and medium-sized businesses move through these channels. We sell directly to, or enter into consignment arrangements with, a number of our traditional retailers, increasingly leveraging their online presence in addition to their in-store space, and online retailers. The remaining traditional 
 4


retailers, as well as our online retailers, are fulfilled through wholesale distributors. We work directly with our retail channels on market development activities, such as co-advertising, on-line promotions and video demonstrations, instant rebate programs, event sponsorship and sales associate training. Our largest retailers include Best Buy Co., Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Costco Wholesale, and their affiliates.
 DMRs and VARs. We sell into the business marketplace through an extensive network of DMRs and VARs. Our DMRs include companies such as CDW and Insight. VARs include our network of registered NETGEAR Solution Partners. DMRs and VARs may receive sales incentives, marketing support and other program benefits from us. Our DMRs and VARs generally purchase our products through our wholesale distributors.
 Broadband Service Providers. We also supply directly to broadband service providers in the United States and internationally providing cable, DSL and 4G/5G mobile broadband products. Service providers supply our products to their business and home subscribers. Our largest broadband service providers include AT&T and Telstra.
 The largest portion of our net revenues was derived in the Americas in the year ended December 31, 2020. Americas sales as a percentage of net revenue was 71.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020, up from 65.4% in the year ended December 31, 2019. We have continuously committed resources to our international operations and sales channels. Accordingly, we are subject to a number of risks related to international operations such as macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions, geopolitical instability, preference for locally branded products, exchange rate fluctuations, increased difficulty in managing inventory, challenges of staffing and managing foreign operations, the effect of international sales on our tax structure, and changes in local tax laws. For further information regarding these risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 For information regarding our significant customers, refer to Note 13, Segment Information, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We design our products and services to meet the specific needs of the consumer, business and service provider markets, tailoring various elements of the software interface, the product design, including component specification, physical characteristics such as casing, design and coloration, and specific user interface features to meet the needs of these markets. We also leverage many of our technological developments, high volume manufacturing, technical support and engineering infrastructure across our markets to maximize business efficiencies.
 Our products that target the business market are generally designed with an industrial appearance, including metal cases and, for some product categories, the ability to mount the product within standard data networking racks as well as unique mounting solutions for other uses. These products typically include higher port counts, higher data transfer rates and other performance characteristics designed to meet the needs of a business user. For example, we offer data transfer rates up to ten gigabits per second for our business products to meet the higher capacity requirements of business users. Our newest business Power over Ethernet (“PoE”)++ switches, including cloud managed and unmanaged PoE switches, provide elevated power budgets and uninterrupted PoE++ power for businesses of all sizes to address the growing need for deployment of multiple PoE devices with more power, due to the widespread adoption of IP communication, security cameras, WiFi access points, proximity sensors, and various other new applications. Some of these products are also designed to support transmission modes such as fiber optic cabling, which is common in more sophisticated business environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a shift in the demand and use cases for SMB products as more small businesses are now running out of homes. Products like our Orbi Pro with VLAN management, and our access points coupled with plug and play PoE VLAN switches are simple and cost effective solutions that enable network segregation in homes between business and personal use. This shift has contributed to growing the market for lower port count switches and our SMB wireless offerings. In addition, we continue to see a shift from traditional AV applications utilizing HDMI technology to ethernet switching driven by a transition from the 1080p to 4K to 8K video, and broadcast moving towards multicast streaming. We continue to develop and pursue avenues like health, personal fitness and sports industries for deployment of our next generation AV systems that transport audio and video signals over Ethernet.

Security requirements within our products for business broadband access include firewall and VPN capabilities that allow for secure interactions between remote offices and business headquarter locations over the internet. Our connectivity product offerings for the business market include enhanced security and remote configurability often required in a business setting.
 Our vision for the home network is about intelligently controlling and monitoring all devices connected to the home network at all times, thus creating a Smart Environment. Our focus is to continue to introduce new products and services into growth areas that form the basis of Smart Homes, such as: the fastest WiFi standards with broadest coverage via latest technology (802.11ax) WiFi routers and home WiFi systems; high speed DOCSIS 3.1, xDSL and fiber gateways with more integrated functions; 5G mobile gateways and mobile hotspots; Digital Canvasses; and other automation devices. We continue to announce and introduce new products in these key markets.
 Our vision for the business network is to increase the effectiveness, efficiency and supportability of the hybrid cloud access network. We believe small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to move into cloud-based applications, such as: Salesforce.com, Ring Central, Zoom video conferencing, SAP SuccessFactors, Workday, and others. In addition, we believe these enterprises will move into utility-like on demand computing power supplied by third-party data centers. Also, increasingly more enterprises are enabling the BYOD (bring your own device) environment allowing smart phones, tablets, and netbooks to be the business computing devices of choice. We believe that the need for cost efficient and easy-to-use video surveillance by small businesses and corporate offices will continue to grow and fuel the growth of our PoE(+) market, with its ability to power 4K cameras. These trends will place a greater demand on business networks. To meet this demand we are introducing next generation technology, such as: PoE switches, Multi-gigabit Ethernet switches, Wi-Fi mesh systems, high capacity local and remote unified storage, small to medium capacity campus wireless LAN, and security appliances. In addition, our Insight line of cloud-connected networking devices can be managed remotely and securely via mobile Apps or Browser interfaces, providing continuous monitoring and instantaneous fault notification.
 Competition
 The consumer, business and service provider markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Our principal competitors include:

• | within the consumer markets, companies such as ARRIS, ASUS, AVM, Devolo, D-Link, Eero (owned by Amazon), Linksys (owned by Foxconn), Nest (owned by Google), Samsung, Synology, and TP Link;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | within the business markets, companies such as Allied Telesys, Barracuda, Cisco Systems, Dell, D-Link, Fortinet, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, QNAP Systems, SonicWall, Synology, TP Link, Ubiquiti, and WatchGuard; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | within the service provider markets, companies such as Actiontec, Airties, Arcadyan, ARRIS, ASUS, AVM, Compal Broadband, D-Link, Eero (owned by Amazon), Franklin, Google, Hitron, Huawei, Inseego, Plume, Sagem, Sercomm, SMC Networks, TechniColor, TP-Link, Ubee, ZTE and ZyXEL.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our potential competitors include other consumer electronics vendors, including Apple, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba and Vizio, who could integrate networking and streaming capabilities into their line of products, such as televisions, set top boxes, voice assistants and gaming consoles, and our channel customers who may decide to offer self-branded networking products. We also face competition from service providers who may bundle a free networking device with their broadband service offering, which would reduce our sales if we were not the supplier of choice to those service providers. In the service provider space, we also face significant and increased competition from original design manufacturers ("ODMs") and contract manufacturers ("CMs") who are selling and attempting to sell their products directly to service providers around the world.
 Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. As a result, they may have more advanced technology, larger distribution channels, stronger brand names, better customer service and access to more customers than we do. For example, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise has significant brand name recognition and has an advertising presence substantially greater than ours. Similarly, Cisco Systems is well recognized as a leader in providing networking products to businesses, while Google and Amazon compete in the consumer Wi-Fi product market, and both have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Several of our competitors, such as TP-Link, offer a range of products that directly compete with most of our product offerings. Several of our other 
 7


competitors compete in a more limited manner. For example, Dell sells networking products primarily targeted at larger businesses or enterprises while Google and Amazon primarily only sell WiFi mesh systems. The competitive environment in which we operate changes rapidly due to technological reasons and other factors outside of our control, such as new entrants to the market and the ability of market participants to adapt to changing environments, such as impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Other companies with significant resources could also become direct competitors, either through acquiring a competitor or through internal efforts.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in the consumer, business and service provider markets for networking products include product breadth, size and scope of the sales channel, brand name, timeliness of new product introductions, product availability, performance, features, functionality and reliability, price, ease-of-installation, maintenance and use, and customer service and support. We believe our products are competitive in these markets based on these factors.
 To remain competitive, we must invest significant resources in developing new products and service offerings, and enhancing usability of our current products, while continuing to expand our sales channels and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide.
 Research and Development
 Our success depends on our ability to develop products that meet changing user needs and to anticipate and proactively respond to evolving technology in a timely and cost-effective manner. Accordingly, we have made investments in our research and development department in order to effectively evaluate existing and new third-party technologies, develop existing and new in-house technologies, and develop and test new products and services. Our research and development employees work closely with our technology and manufacturing partners to bring high quality new products and services to market in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
 We identify, qualify or self-develop new technologies to develop products using one or both of the methodologies described below.
 ODM. Under the ODM methodology, we define the product concept and specifications and recommend the technology selection. We then coordinate with our technology suppliers as they develop the product, meeting our specifications, while our internal software engineering team typically works with our service partners to develop the software services that run on these devices. On certain new products, one or more subsystems of the design can be done in-house and then integrated with the remaining design pieces from the ODM. Once prototypes are completed, we work with our partners to complete the debugging and systems integration and testing. After completion of the final tests, agency approvals and product documentation, the product is released for production.
 In-House Development. Under the in-house development model, one or more subsystems of the product are designed and developed utilizing the NETGEAR engineering team. Under this model, some of the primary technology is developed in-house. We then work closely with either an ODM or a Joint Development Manufacturer ("JDM") to complete the development of the entire design, perform the necessary testing, and obtain regulatory approvals before the product is released for production.
 Manufacturing
 Our primary manufacturers are Cloud Network Technology (more commonly known as Hon Hai Precision or Foxconn Corporation), Delta Electronics Incorporated, Wistron NeWeb Corporation, and Pegatron Corporation, all of which are headquartered in Taiwan. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we commenced manufacturing in Haiphong, Vietnam at a new facility owned by Shenzhen Gongjin Electronics Co., Ltd. (more commonly known as T&W), which is headquartered in China. Beginning in September 2018 and upon the introduction of Section 301 tariffs by the US government on a significant number of US bound products manufactured in China, we migrated manufacturing locations away from mainland China with manufacturing relating to US bound products now occurring in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan. We distribute our manufacturing among a limited number of key suppliers and seek to avoid excessive concentration with any one single supplier. Currently, however, we have a concentration among two of our major suppliers in South East Asia that we expect will continue through fiscal 2021. Any disruptions from natural disasters, health epidemics and political, social and economic instability would affect the ability of our manufacturers to manufacture our products. If our manufacturing or warehousing facilities are 
 8


disrupted or destroyed, we would not have readily available alternatives for manufacturing our products and our business would be significantly impacted. In addition to their responsibility for the manufacturing of our products, our manufacturers typically purchase all necessary parts and materials to produce finished goods. To maintain quality standards for our suppliers, we have established our own product quality organization, based in Singapore and mainland China. The organization is responsible for auditing and inspecting process and product quality on the premises of our ODMs. 
 We obtain several key components from limited or sole sources. These include many of the semiconductors used in our products, which are designed specifically for the products and obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis like switching fabric semiconductors used in our Ethernet switches and internet gateway products; wireless local area network chipsets used in our wireless products and mobile network chipsets which are used in our wireless gateways and hotspots. We also have limited sources for components including connector jacks, plastic casings and physical layer transceivers. Our third-party manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf on a purchase order basis. If these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements or component lead times deviate from expectations, our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries would be harmed and we may lose sales and experience increased costs to procure supply. For instance, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced supply shortages for semiconductor components, particularly WiFi 6 chipsets due to high demand, resulting in elongated manufacturing timelines.
 We currently outsource warehousing and distribution logistics to four main third-party providers who are responsible for warehousing, distribution logistics and order fulfillment. In addition, these parties are also responsible for some configuration and re-packaging of our products including bundling components to form kits, inserting appropriate documentation, disk drive configuration, and adding power adapters. APL Logistics Americas, Ltd. in City of Industry, California serves the Americas region, Kerry Logistics Ltd. in Singapore, serves the Asia Pacific region, DSV Solutions B.V. Netherlands serves the EMEA region, and Brightstar Logistics Pty Ltd. in Melbourne, VIC, Australia serves Australia and New Zealand.
 Sales and Marketing
 We work directly with our customers on market development activities, such as co-advertising, online promotions and video demonstrations, live and virtual event sponsorships and sales associate training. We also participate in major industry trade shows and marketing events. Our marketing department is comprised of our channel marketing, product marketing and corporate marketing groups.
 Our channel marketing team focuses on working with the sales teams to maximize our participation in channel partner marketing activities and merchandise our products both online and in store.
 Our product marketing group focuses on product and service strategy, product and service development roadmaps, the new product introduction process, product lifecycle management, demand assessment and competitive analysis. The group works closely with our sales and research and development groups to align our product development roadmap to meet customer technology demands from a strategic perspective. The group also ensures that product development activities, product launches, and ongoing demand and supply planning occur in a well-managed, timely basis in coordination with our development, manufacturing, and sales groups, as well as our ODM and sales channel partners.
 Our corporate marketing group is responsible for defining and building our corporate brand, supporting the business units with creative marketing strategies and driving traffic to our online and in-app platforms. The group focuses on defining our brand promise and marketing messages on a worldwide basis. This group is also responsible for driving awareness and demand for NETGEAR products through paid, earned and owned channels to reach and acquire new customers. Marketing tactics include driving the social media and online marketing strategy, public relations, install base marketing programs, community engagement programs, sponsorships and events, and corporate websites worldwide, as well as creative production for all product categories.
 We conduct most of our international sales and marketing operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, which operate via sales and marketing subsidiaries and branch offices worldwide.

Customer Support
 We design our products with ease-of-use top of mind. We respond globally to customer inquiries through a variety of channels including phone, chat, community, social media, and email. Customers can also get self-help service through the comprehensive knowledgebase and the user forums on our website. Customer support is provided through a combination of a limited number of permanent employees and use of subcontracted, out-sourced resources. Our permanent employees design our technical support model and process and are responsible for training and managing our outsourced sub-contractors. They also handle escalations from the outsourced resources. We utilize the information gained from customers by our customer support organization to enhance our product offerings, including further simplifying the installation process.
Intellectual Property
 We believe that our continued success will depend primarily on the technical expertise, speed of technology implementation, creative skills and management abilities of our officers and key employees, plus ownership of a limited but important set of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents. We primarily rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and patent laws, nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants and suppliers and other contractual provisions to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. We hold approximately 253 issued United States patents that expire between years 2021 and 2037 and 39 foreign patents that expire between 2021 and 2035. In addition, we currently have approximately 38 pending United States and foreign patent applications related to technology and products offered by us. We also rely on third-party licensors for patented hardware and software license rights in technology that are incorporated into and are necessary for the operation and functionality of our products. Our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to these technologies.
 We have trade secret rights for our products, consisting mainly of product design, technical product documentation and software. We also own, or have applied for registration of trademarks, in connection with our products in the United States and internationally, including NETGEAR, NETGEAR Armor, NETGEAR Insight, NPG, NPG logo, Everybody’s Connecting, AirCard, AirCard Enabled, Around Town, Orbi, Genie, Genie+, the Genie logo, ReadyShare, ProSafe, ReadyNAS, ReadyData, ReadyCloud, ReadyStore, Centria, Nighthawk, Nighthawk x6, Zing Mobile Hotspot, Ufast, NETGEAR Insight, NETGEAR UP, FASTLANE3, Meural, Trueart, Digital Canvas, Watcher, and X-RAID.
 We have registered a number of internet domain names that we use for electronic interaction with our customers including dissemination of product information, marketing programs, product registration, sales activities, and other commercial uses.
 Seasonal Business
 We have historically experienced increased net sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the first and second quarters in our fiscal year due to seasonal demand from consumer markets primarily relating to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. This pronounced seasonality has been previously offset by irregular and significant purchases from customers in other markets, such as the service provider market. As the proportion of our revenue derived from consumer focused products grows relative to our overall business, the impact of the seasonally high third and fourth fiscal quarters shall become more pronounced than experienced in prior years. However, we anticipate the impact of seasonality in 2021 to be less pronounced as we strive to secure additional inventory in the first half of 2021 to meet demand while rebuilding our channel partners’ inventory levels, such levels having been depleted since onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Governmental Regulations 
          Environmental Laws
 Our products and manufacturing process are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which cover both the use of various materials as well as environmental concerns. Environmental issues such as pollution and climate change have had significant legislative and regulatory effects on a global basis, and there are expected to be additional changes to the regulations in these areas. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy, which 
 10


may have an impact on the way we manufacture products or utilize energy to produce our products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials we use in our products and the cost of compliance. Other regulations in the environmental area may require us to continue to monitor and ensure proper disposal or recycling of our products. To the best of our knowledge, we maintain compliance with all current government regulations concerning our production processes for all locations in which we operate. Since we operate on a global basis, this is a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and compliance effort to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with all existing regulations.
 Other Regulations
 As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and environmental regulations, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future. For further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business, see the related discussion in “Risk Factors – Financial, Legal, Regulatory and Tax Compliance Risks”.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 818 full-time employees, with 261 in sales, marketing and technical support, 311 in research and development, 104 in operations, and 142 in finance, information systems and administration. We also utilize a number of temporary staff to supplement our workforce. We have never had a work stoppage among our employees, no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Culture
 
        Our mission to connect the world using innovative networking products cannot be achieved without employing imaginative, talented and committed individuals from around the world. We strive to foster a diverse and inclusive environment that both attracts and retains team members who align with our core values of:

• | Achievement
--+------------


• | Simplicity
--+-----------


• | People
--+-------


• | Innovation
--+-----------


• | Results
--+--------


• | Ethics
--+-------

 
        We strive to create a respectful work environment characterized by mutual trust and the absence of intimidation, oppression, discrimination and exploitation, and we believe that nurturing this type of environment allows for the opportunity to turn creative ideas into innovative products.
 
Recruitment and Retention
 
We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. By improving employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our customers and protect the long-term interests of our stakeholders and stockholders. We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives, and offer competitive compensation packages, ensuring fairness in internal compensation practices. We conduct employee engagement surveys every two years and on an ad hoc basis in order to assess ways in which we can improve employee satisfaction, and then incorporate feedback from these surveys into our culture and operations.

To further engage and incentivize our workforce, we offer a wide range of programs and avenues for support, motivation, and professional recognition. We utilize both instructor-led training and online learning to provide training courses to ensure the professional development of our employees. 
 
We are committed to providing comprehensive benefits options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of our wide ranging benefits offered are: Health insurance (Medical, dental insurance and vision), life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, identity theft insurance and pet insurance, employer match of employee 401(k) contributions, stock awards and an employee stock purchase plan.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
        We believe that our employee population should be reflective of the communities where we live and serve, and we are committed to promoting and cultivating an inclusive and diverse culture that welcomes and celebrates everyone without bias. A diverse environment representing a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures and where everyone feels like they belong fosters innovative ideas and best-in-class products. We are executing on a number of employment-related strategies, including recruitment, onboarding, compensation, training, performance management and professional development, that foster inclusion and equity.
 
 We demonstrate diversity, equity, and inclusion at the highest levels of our company. Fifty percent of our independent directors are female, and fifty-five percent of our executive management team self-identify as diverse, in terms of race, ethnicity or gender.
 
Business ethics
 
We are dedicated to imbuing our employees with the highest commitment to integrity and business ethics possible. Ethics are deeply embedded in our values and business processes. We regularly convey our commitment to ethics and integrity in employee communications, in our everyday actions and in processes and controls. We conduct presentations on our commitment to integrity and business ethics at all new hire training sessions and at each quarterly all hands meeting. We also maintain an ethics-related hotline, through which individuals can anonymously raise concerns they have about business behavior they do not feel comfortable discussing personally with managers or human resources personnel. 
 
Community Involvement
 
         We believe in giving back to communities where we live and work. We encourage our employees to participate in community service activities and provide time off for them to do so. In addition, we donate both time and resources to non-profit organizations around the world.
