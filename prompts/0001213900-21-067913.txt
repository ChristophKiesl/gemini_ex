ITEM 1. BUSINESS



In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Gesher I Acquisition Corp.



We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands on February 23, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we intend to focus our search for target businesses in the cannabis industry.



In February 2021, we issued an aggregate of 2,875,000 ordinary shares (“founders’ shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share, to Gesher I Sponsor LLC (“Sponsor”).



In February 2021, we also issued to designees of EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters in our initial public offering (“IPO”), an aggregate of 200,000 ordinary shares (“representative shares”) at a price of $0.0001 per share.



On October 14, 2021, we consummated the IPO of 10,000,000 units. Each unit (“Unit”) consists of one ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000.



Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 4,550,000 warrants (“Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $4,550,000. The Private Warrants were sold to the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital and its designees. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units sold in the IPO.



On October 21, 2021, we consummated the sale of an additional 1,500,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $15,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional Units, we consummated the sale of an additional 450,000 Private Warrants at $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $450,000. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Warrants, an aggregate amount of $116,150,000 has been placed in the trust account established in connection with the IPO.



On November 9, 2021, the ordinary shares and Warrants included in the Units began separate trading.
