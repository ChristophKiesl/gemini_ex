ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Historically, we have been primarily focused on the research and development of nervous system therapies based on our proprietary human neural stem cells and our small molecule compounds with the ultimate goal of gaining approval from the “FDA”, and its international counterparts, to market and commercialize such therapies. In early 2019, we commenced a strategic assessment of our clinical programs to determinate how to maximize shareholder value. As a result, Seneca subsequently initiated an:

· | in-licensing and acquisition strategy in which it is evaluating novel therapeutics that could benefit from our development experience with the goal of developing such technologies for commercialization; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | out-licensing strategy to find partners to acquire or license NSI-566 and NSI-189.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In-licensing and Acquisition Strategy
 
In early 2019, we engaged Hibiscus Bioventures (“Hibiscus”) and initiated an in-licensing and/or acquisition strategy to expand our product pipeline. Our in-licensing strategy consists of evaluating novel therapeutics that could be synergistic to us with the goal of developing such candidates for commercialization. We believe that this element of our corporate strategy could provide new opportunities for product development and diversify risks inherent in focusing on a limited product portfolio and therapeutic areas, thus potentially increasing its probability of commercial success. In December 2019, we further expanded this initiative and engaged Solebury Capital LLC (“Solebury”) to help explore available strategic alternatives, including possible mergers and business combinations, a sale of part or all of our assets, and collaboration and licensing arrangements.

Out-Licensing and Sales Strategy
 
Based on our review of existing clinical programs, including required capital and time to market, we have initiated an out-licensing and sales strategy to find partners or interested parties to acquire or license NSI-566 (neural stem cell) and NSI-189 (small molecule) and their respective clinical and pre-clinical programs and development. As part of this strategy, we begun winding down our ongoing development efforts, pre-clinical and clinical stage studies.
 
In December of 2020, we licensed certain patents and technologies, including a sublicense, related to the NSI- 189 small molecule program for $100,000 up front for a three (3) year period, plus, upon the occurrence of certain events, the licensee has the right to purchase the NSI-189 small molecule program for $5,000,000 at any time before the three (3) year period expires.
 
Our Present Focus
 
After conducting a strategic alternatives evaluation, with a goal of maximizing stockholder value, we substantially reduced our workforce and have wound down and suspended our research and development activities. We continue to: (a) provide support for patients who remain in clinical trials, (b) conduct our day-to-day business operations including the limited remaining activities required to wrap up our trial (c) support our intellectual property portfolio with a goal of maximizing stockholder value and (d) undertake our out-licensing and in-licensing acquisition initiatives.
 
Following our assessment, we commenced a process of evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value with the assistance of Hibiscus and Solebury. After conducting a diligent and extensive process of evaluating strategic alternatives and identifying and reviewing potential candidates for a strategic acquisition or other transaction, which included the receipt of 15 non-binding indications of interest from interested parties and careful evaluation and consideration of those proposals, and following extensive negotiation with a number of possible candidates, on December 17, 2020, Seneca and Leading BioSciences, Inc. (“LBS”) announced the signing of a merger agreement (“Merger Agreement”). Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the Merger Agreement, including approval of the transaction by our stockholders, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seneca will be merged with and into LBS, with LBS being the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seneca (“Merger”).
 
Although we have entered into the Merger Agreement and intend to consummate the transaction, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate the proposed merger on a timely basis, or at all. If, for any reason, the merger is not completed, we will reconsider our strategic alternatives and could pursue one or more of the following courses of action:
 

· | Dissolve and liquidate our assets. If, for any reason, the merger is not consummated and we are unable to identify and complete an alternative strategic transaction like a merger or potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for our assets, or continue to operate our business due to the inability to raise additional funding, we may be required to dissolve and liquidate our assets. In such case, there can be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to our stockholders, if any, after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursue potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for our assets, including a sale or other divestiture.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to operate our business. Although presently not anticipated, we could elect to continue to operate our business and pursue licensing or partnering transactions or utilize our intellectual property and research and discovery platform. Based on our prior assessment, this would require a significant amount of time, financial resources, human capital and Seneca would be subject to all the risk and uncertainties involved in the development of product candidates. In such instance, there is no assurance that we could raise sufficient capital to support these efforts, that our development efforts would be successful or that we could successfully obtain the regulatory approvals required to market any product candidate we pursued.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursue another strategic transaction like the proposed merger.

Seneca’s Proprietary Technology Platform
 
Our patented technology platform has three core components:
 
1.       Over 300 lines of human, regionally specific neural stem cells, some of which have the potential to be used to treat serious or life-threatening diseases through direct transplantation into the central nervous system;
 
2.       Proprietary screening capability – Seneca’s ability to generate human neural stem cell lines provides a platform for chemical screening and discovery of novel compounds against nervous system disorders; and

-

 
3.       Small molecules that resulted from Seneca’s neurogenesis screening platform that may have the potential to treat a wide variety of nervous system conditions.
 
To date, our technology platform has produced two lead assets: our NSI-566 stem cell therapy program and our NSI-189 small molecule program. A component of our strategy is seeking an asset sale, out-license, or global development partnerships to further development of NSI-566 and NSI-189. We have recently initiated a formal initiative aimed at securing partners to advance the clinical development of these two programs.
 
We believe our technology, in partnership with an established biopharmaceutical company with the appropriate development expertise and financial resources, could facilitate the development and commercialization of products for use in the treatment of a wide array of nervous system disorders including neurodegenerative conditions and regenerative repair of acute and chronic disease.
 
Clinical Programs
 
Historically, we have devoted our efforts and financial resources primarily to the pre-clinical and clinical development of our small molecule compounds and our stem cell therapeutics.
 
Based on our cash position, we have refocused our efforts primarily on maintaining the cell lines, patents, clinical material and data, and relevant licenses associated with these clinical programs as we seek partners for further development.
 
Below is a description of our clinical programs, their intended indication and current stage of development:
 

NSI - 566 (Stem Cells)
 
The human central nervous system (CNS) has limited capacity for regeneration following injury or the onset of disease. Traditional therapies have mainly focused on minimizing the progression or symptoms of CNS disease or injury but have not been effective at repairing the underlying cause of such disease. The goal of our cell therapy initiatives has been the regeneration of neural function which has been lost to disease or injury. We believe that neuroprotection, neuroregeneration, and/or bridging of damaged neural circuitry may be accomplished by implantation of NSI-566 at the injury site.
Clinical Experience with NSI-566
 
Chronic Spinal Cord Injury
 
In 2013, we received authorization from the FDA to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial to treat chronic spinal cord injury. The trial, which took place at The University of California, San Diego or UCSD, commenced in 2014 and the first subject was treated in October 2014. The study enrolled four AIS A classification thoracic spinal cord injury subjects (motor and sensory complete), one to two years’ post-injury at the time of stem cell treatment. In January of 2016 we reported six-month follow-up data on all four subjects. The stem cell treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated by the subjects enrolled and there were no serious adverse events. In April of 2018 we enrolled the first subject in the second cohort of the trial, which included patients with AIS-A complete, quadriplegic, cervical injuries involving C5-C7 of their spinal cord. The final patient of this cohort was enrolled in March 2019.
 
In June 2018, the study investigators published the results of the first cohort in the journal Cell Stem Cell. The results support the potential of transplanted NSI-566 to benefit patients with cSCI. At 18 months to 27 months after surgery, the analysis of motor and sensory function and electrophysiology showed changes in three of the four patients after NSI-566 transplantation. There was no evidence of serious adverse events, suggesting the procedure is well-tolerated.

In January 2021, we announced preliminary, top-line results of the Company's placebo controlled Phase 2 stroke study (non-GCP) that was conducted in Beijing, China. The trial was designed to evaluate the relative safety of our human neural stem cell therapy, NSI-566, in patients with stable deficits in motor function resulting from ischemic stroke. Patients were eligible for the trial if they had documented history of ischemic stroke at least four months, but no more than 24 months, before surgery.
 
The study enrolled 23 patients who were randomly assigned to treatment or placebo arms. Patients in the treatment arm received intracerebral injection of 72 million stem cells, whereas those in the placebo group underwent a sham surgery procedure. Secondary objectives to evaluate efficacy were performed by qualified assessors who were blinded to treatment assignment, and included the Fugl-Meyer Motor Score (FMMS), an assessment of upper and lower motor function that comprises a 100-point scale and is widely used following stroke.
 
Patients enrolled in the treatment and placebo arms had similar baseline FMMS scores before surgery (mean ± SD: 36.80 ± 8.59 and 35.80 ± 4.66, respectively). While most participants showed some improvement in FMMS from pre-surgery scores, the mean improvement after one year was greater in those participants receiving NSI-566 (n=10, mean ± SD: 12.20 ± 14.15) compared to placebo (n=10, 6.30 ± 5.14), though the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance using the approximate Student's t-test (MMRM) (p=0.231). Two participants in the treatment arm showed clinically important improvements of 32 and 44 points on the FMMS following treatment with NSI-566, whereas the largest improvement observed in the placebo group was 17 points. Participants in the treatment arm experienced a total of three serious adverse events (SAE) that were considered by the investigator to be probably or possibly related to treatment, whereas no patients in the placebo arm experienced SAEs. Treatment-related SAEs were resolved with standard medical care and were limited to impaired healing at the incision site and wound dehiscence in one patient, and impaired hepatic function in another.
 
NSI-189 (Small Molecule Pharmaceutical Compound)
 
NSI-189 represents a new chemical entity that works through what appears to be a novel mechanism of action to stimulate neurogenesis of stem cells in the hippocampus, as well as generation of new synapses. Because impaired hippocampal neurogenesis has been linked with depression, we conducted clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NSI-189 in patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder or MDD.
 
Out-license of NSI-189
 
In December 2020, we licensed certain patents and technologies, including a sublicense, related to the NSI- 189 small molecule program for $100,000 up front for a three (3) year period, plus, upon the occurrence of certain events, the licensee has the right to purchase the NSI-189 small molecule program for $5,000,000 at any time before the three (3) year period expires.
 
Seneca’s Technologies
 
Stem Cells
 
From a therapeutic perspective, our stem cell-based technology enables the isolation and large-scale expansion of regionally specific, human neural stem cells from all areas of the developing human brain and spinal cord thus enabling the generation of physiologically relevant human neurons of different types. We believe that our stem cell technology will enable the replacement or supplementation of malfunctioning or dead cells thereby creating a neurotrophic environment that offers protection to neural tissue as a way to treat disease and injury. Many significant and currently untreatable human diseases arise from the loss or malfunction of specific cell types in the body. Our focus is the development of effective methods to generate replacement cells from neural stem cells. We believe that creating a neurotrophic environment by replacing damaged, malfunctioning or dead neural cells with fully functional ones may be a useful therapeutic strategy in treating many diseases and conditions of the central nervous system.
Intellectual Property
 
We have developed and maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications that form the proprietary base for our research and development efforts. We own or exclusively license 17 United States issued and pending patents and over 77 foreign issued and pending patents in the field of regenerative medicine, related to our stem cell technologies as well as our small molecule compounds. Our issued patents have expiration dates ranging from 2023 through 2038.
 
When appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe will provide us with a competitive advantage. We accomplish this by filing patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, although not always, we file patent applications both in the United States and in select international markets. In addition, we plan to obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interests.

-

 
In addition to patenting our technologies, we also rely on confidential and proprietary information and take active measures to control access to that information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors.
 
Our policy is to require our employees, consultants and significant scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers to execute confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual’s or entity’s relationship with us, is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual or entity in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies and chemical and medical products companies. Many of these companies are well-established and possess greater resources for technical, research, development, financial, sales and marketing initiatives than we do. Other, less well-established companies have formed or may form strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that may provide research and development and commercialization advantages to these competitors. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those we are developing. Moreover, many of these competitors may be able obtain patent protection, or FDA and other regulatory approvals that may impede on our freedom to develop and commercialize our proposed products.
 
The diseases and medical conditions we are targeting have a demographic in which there are large numbers of patients who do not respond to current therapies or have limited therapies available. Nevertheless, we expect that our technologies and product candidates, if or when approved, will compete with a variety of therapeutic products and procedures offered by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are investigating new drugs and therapeutic approaches for the same or similar indications. These companies’ efforts may achieve new efficacy profiles, extend the therapeutic window for such products, alter the prognosis of these diseases, or prevent their onset. We believe that our products, if or when approved, will attempt to compete with these products principally on the basis of improved and extended efficacy and safety and their overall economic benefit to the health care system. Competition to our products may be in the form of existing and new drugs, other forms of cell transplantation, surgical procedures, gene therapy or other proprietary technology and expertise. We expect that all of these products will compete with our product candidates, if or when approved, based on efficacy, safety, cost and intellectual property positions. We cannot be certain that other entities have not filed patents that block our freedom to commercialize our programs and we may be required to seek licenses from these entities in order to commercialize certain of our proposed products, and such licenses may not be granted or be extremely expensive to obtain.
 
Government Regulation
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in our research and development and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of our proposed products. The nature and extent to which such regulation applies to our products will vary depending on the nature of any products we may develop. Governmental authorities, including the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, regulate the design, development, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion and marketing of pharmaceutical products, including drugs and biologics, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and, for biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other judicially imposed sanctions, including product seizures, import restrictions, injunctive actions and criminal prosecutions of both companies and individuals. In addition, administrative remedies can involve requests to recall violative products; the refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts; or the refusal to approve pending product approval applications until manufacturing or other alleged deficiencies are brought into compliance. The FDA also has the authority to cause the withdrawal of approval of a marketed product or to impose labeling restrictions. The process of obtaining approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated similar trials. Similarly, an institutional review board, or IRB, can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Human cell-based therapies in the field of regenerative medicine are relatively novel. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of such products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 
United States Review and Approval Process
 
After the completion of clinical trials of a product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA or NDA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA or NDA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information as well as a significant user fee. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA or NDA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA or NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, and in each case, whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP or GTP, if applicable. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA or NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA or NDA without a REMS, if required.
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval via a letter detailing such deficiencies. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the FDA denies an application, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified by the FDA, or withdraw the application.
 
United States Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
 
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of some, or all, clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP and GTP regulations, as applicable. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, GTP and other laws.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 
European, China and Other Regulatory Review and Approval
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe, China and other countries will be necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union, China and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for biological and pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval.

Other Health Care Laws
 
In the event any of our proposed products are ever approved for marketing, we may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician sunshine and privacy and security laws and regulations.
Other Regulations
 
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our business. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had seven (7) full-time employees. We anticipate that upon the consummation of the merger with Leading BioSciences, Inc., we will terminate our current employees and consultants. We also use the services of several outside consultants in business and scientific matters. Historically, we have not implemented measures or objectives to address the development, attraction and retention of personnel and have instead hired employees and utilized the services of outside consultants as needed to run our operations.
Facilities
 
We currently operate one facility located in the United States and one facility located in China. Our corporate offices and primary research facilities are located in Germantown, Maryland, where we lease approximately 1,500 square feet. This lease provides for monthly payments of approximately $5,600 per month and expires on December 31, 2021. 
 
We also lease approximately 11,300 square feet of research facility in the People’s Republic of China. This lease commenced in September 2019, provides for minimum lease payments of approximately $4,400 per month, expires in September 2024 and provides us with a future first right of refusal for extending the lease beyond its expiration.
