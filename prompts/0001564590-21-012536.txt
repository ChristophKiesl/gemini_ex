Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing potential first-in-class restorative therapeutics that ignite the body’s natural process to repair and maintain healthy biological function.
 Our technology is based on the discovery that growing fibroblast cells under simulated embryonic conditions induces them to become multipotent with stem cell like properties. The environment created by our proprietary process mimics the conditions within the womb — very low oxygen and suspension. When cultured under these conditions, the fibroblast cells generate biological materials, growth factors and proteins, that have the potential to stimulate a person’s own stem cells to activate and replace/regenerate damaged cells and tissue. Our proprietary, reproducible manufacturing process provides targeted solutions that harness the body’s inherent regenerative power across a broad range of therapeutic indications including hair growth, joint cartilage regeneration, spinal disc repair and dermal rejuvenation.
 Our reproducible manufacturing process yields multiple biologic products from a single bioreactor, including cell conditioned medium (CCM), human extracellular matrix (hECM) and hair stimulating complex (HSC), creating a spectrum of products for a variety of markets from one core technology. 
  
• | Human Multipotent Cell Conditioned Media, or CCM: A soluble multipotent CCM that is the starting material for products for skin care and other applications. The liquid complex produced through Histogen’s manufacturing process contains soluble biologicals with a diverse range of embryonic-like proteins. Because the cells produce and secrete these factors while developing the extracellular matrix, or ECM, these proteins are naturally infused into the liquid media in a stabilized form. The CCM contains a diverse mixture of cell-signaling materials, including human growth factors such as Keratinocyte Growth Factor, soluble human ECM proteins such as collagen, and vital proteins which support the epidermal stem cells that renew skin throughout life.

• | Human Extracellular Matrix, or hECM: An insoluble hECM for applications such as orthopedics and soft tissue augmentation, which can be fabricated into a variety of structural or functional forms for tissue engineering and clinical applications. The hECM produced through our proprietary process is a novel, all-human, naturally secreted material. It is most similar to early embryonic structural tissue which provides the framework and signals necessary for cell in-growth and tissue development. By producing similar ECM materials to those that aided in the original formation of these tissues in the embryo, regenerative cells are supported in vitro and have shown potential as therapeutics in vivo.

• | Hair Stimulating Complex, or HSC: A soluble biologic comprised of growth factors involved in the signaling of cells in the body, particularly those factors known to be important in hair formation and the stimulation of resting hair follicles.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the hECM and HSC core technology platforms, we have three product candidates in development intended to address what we believe to be underserved, multibillion-dollar global markets, HST-001, a treatment for hair loss, HST-003, a treatment for joint cartilage repair and an asset previously developed by Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Conatus”) that we retained development and commercialization rights to, emricasan, which is being jointly developed with our collaboration partner, Amerimmune, for the potential treatment of COVID-19: 
  
• | HST-001 is a hair stimulating complex, or HSC, intended to be a physician-administered therapeutic for androgenic alopecia (hair loss). HST-001 treatment is minimally-invasive and has been shown in early studies to stimulate resting hair follicles to produce new cosmetically-relevant hair. In May of 2020, we initiated its Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of HST-001, designed to assess the safety, tolerability and indicators of efficacy for HST-001 in the treatment of androgenic alopecia in men. In December of 2020, we announced preliminary week 18 results for the primary efficacy endpoint which, while not statistically significant, supported that patients treated with HST-001 demonstrated separation from placebo patients for absolute change from baseline in total hairs (terminal and vellus) within the target area (TAHC) of the vertex as measured by Canfield’s Hairmetrix macrophotography system. HST-001 was also shown to be safe and well tolerated at week 18 as compared to placebo with no reports of serious adverse events. In February of 2021, we announced the final results from the week 26 assessments. The final results continued to support that HST-001 was shown to be safe and well tolerated as compared to placebo with

no reports of serious adverse events and did not achieve statistical significance at week 26 as compared to placebo. Additional observations at week 26 included that patients treated with HST-001 as compared to baseline, demonstrated a statistically significant change in total hairs (terminal and vellus) within the target area (TAHC) of the vertex as measured by Canfield’s Hairmetrix macrophotography system. We are currently preparing for the next HST-001 clinical trial in men with androgenic alopecia based on the results of the previous Phase 1b/2a clinical trial. We anticipate the trial will commence in the second half of 2021, subject to review and approval by the FDA.

• | HST-003 is a human extracellular matrix, or hECM, intended for regenerating hyaline cartilage for the treatment of articular cartilage defects in the knee, with a novel, malleable scaffold that stimulates the body’s own stem cells. In September 2020, we were awarded a $2.0 million grant by the Peer Reviewed Orthopedic Research Program (PRORP) of the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) to partially fund a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HST-003 for regeneration of cartilage in the knee. The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick MD 21702, is the awarding and administering acquisition office. The views expressed in this filing are ours and may not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Army, Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government. In December of 2020, we filed an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of for HST-003, implanted within microfracture interstices and the cartilage defect in the knee to regenerate hyaline cartilage in combination with a microfracture procedure. In January of 2021, we announced that the FDA had notified the company that the IND for planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HST-003 was placed on clinical hold. The hold is due to additional CMC information required for the FDA to complete their review. Following the receipt of the written clinical hold letter on February 3, 2021, Histogen submitted a complete response letter to the FDA on February 19, 2021 and will continue to work with the FDA to release the clinical hold. We anticipate initiating the HST-003 trial in the second quarter of 2021, pending FDA release of the clinical hold.

• | Emricasan is an orally active pan-caspase inhibitor being jointly developed with our partner Amerimmune for the potential treatment of COVID-19. On October 26, 2020, we entered into a Collaborative Development and Commercialization Agreement with Amerimmune, pursuant to which Amerimmune, at its expense and in collaboration with us, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to lead the development activities for emricasan. We filed and received permission from the FDA for an IND to initiate a Phase 1 study of emricasan in mild COVID-19 patients to assess safety and tolerability and anticipate initiating the trial in the first quarter of 2021.

 Additionally, Histogen has two pre-clinical programs, HST-004 and HST-002:
  
• | HST-004 is a CCM solution intended to be administered through an interdiscal injection for spinal disc repair. Initial preclinical research has shown that the growth- and repair-factor enriched HST-004 stimulates stem cells from spinal disc to proliferate and secrete aggrecan and collagen II, regenerate normal matrix and cell tissue structure, and restore disc height. HST-004 was shown to both reduce inflammation and protease activity and upregulate aggrecan production in an ex vivo spinal disc model. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HST-002 is a human-derived collagen and extracellular matrix dermal filler intended to be injected into the dermis for the treatment of facial folds and wrinkles. HST-002 provides the natural proteins found in young, healthy skin all-human and naturally produced collagen with dermal matrix proteins.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have also developed a non-prescription topical skin care ingredient utilizing CCM that we believe harnesses the power of growth factors and other cell signaling molecules to support our epidermal stem cells, which renew skin throughout life. The CCM ingredient for skin care currently generates product revenue from Allergan Sales LLC (“Allergan”), who formulates the ingredient into their skin care product lines in spas and professional offices.
 
Merger 
 On January 28, 2020, the Company, then operating as Conatus, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”), with privately-held Histogen Inc. (“Private Histogen”) and Chinook Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Conatus (“Merger Sub”). Under the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Private Histogen, with Private Histogen surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
 3


the Company (the “Merger”). On May 26, 2020, the Merger was completed. Conatus changed its name to Histogen Inc., and Private Histogen, which remains as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, changed its name to Histogen Therapeutics Inc. On May 27, 2020, the combined Company’s common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “HSTO”. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Private Histogen common stock immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into approximately 0.14342 shares of Company common stock (the “Exchange Ratio”), after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, as defined below. Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, all shares of Private Histogen preferred stock then outstanding were exchanged into shares of common stock of Private Histogen. In addition, all outstanding options exercisable for common stock of Private Histogen and warrants exercisable for common stock of Private Histogen became options and warrants exercisable for the same number of shares of common stock of the Company multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. Immediately following the Merger, stockholders of Private Histogen owned approximately 71.3% of the outstanding common stock for the combined company. 
 On May 26, 2020, in connection with, and prior to the completion of the Merger, the Company effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of its then outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The par value and the authorized shares of the common stock were not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. All of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. All issued and outstanding Private Histogen common stock, convertible preferred stock, options and warrants prior to the effective date of the Merger have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio for all periods presented. 
 Market and Commercial Opportunity 
 Our proprietary, reproducible manufacturing process provides targeted solutions that harness the body’s inherent regenerative power across a broad range of therapeutic indications including hair growth, joint cartilage regeneration, spinal disc repair and dermal rejuvenation. 
 We currently have three product candidates in development intended to address what we believe to be underserved, multibillion-dollar global markets, HST-001, a treatment for hair loss, HST-003, a treatment for joint cartilage repair and the emricasan asset, which we are jointly developing with our partner, Amerimmune, for the potential treatment for COVID-19:
  
• | HST-001 is an HSC intended to be a physician-administered therapeutic for androgenic alopecia (hair loss). The hair loss market is both large and underserved. We believe this is largely due to the ineffectiveness of currently available options, and the hesitation of many affected to seek invasive surgical treatments. Patients seek a safe, minimally-invasive treatment to achieve cosmetically relevant new hair growth. The development of HST-001 has the potential to expand the hair restoration market by offering an option to those that currently have none, and a potentially more effective option to anyone presently using or considering Rogaine or Propecia.

• | HST-003 is hECM intended for regenerating hyaline cartilage for the treatment of articular cartilage defects in the knee, with a novel, malleable scaffold that stimulates the body’s own stem cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 According to our market research, 0.2 million people in the United States receive joint cartilage repair annually and 17.5 million are considering joint cartilage repair. Physicians, and their patients, are seeking treatments that reverse cartilage degeneration and we believe that the market is growing and share can be obtained with our product. 
  
• | Emricasan is an orally active, pan-caspase inhibitor being jointly developed with Histogen’s partner Amerimmune for the potential treatment of COVID-19. We believe that by reducing the activity of these enzymes, caspase inhibitors have the potential to interrupt a variety of diseases and their progression. To date, emricasan has been studied in over 950 patients in 19 completed clinical trials across a broad range of different indications, such as liver disease, where it is generally found to be safe and well-tolerated. In NASH cirrhosis patients in multiple clinical Phase II trials conducted by Conatus, emricasan demonstrated rapid and sustained reductions in elevated levels of key biomarkers of inflammation and cell death. Similarly, elevated biomarkers are also believed to play a role in the severity and progression of COVID-19 disease and sequela.

Strategic Agreements 
 Amerimmune Collaborative Development and Commercialization Agreement 
 We retained rights to emricasan, an orally active pan-caspase inhibitor, which was an asset previously developed by Conatus. We have been evaluating several alternatives to create opportunities for increasing shareholder value from this asset. On October 26, 2020, we entered into a Collaborative Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Amerimmune pursuant to which we agreed to jointly develop emricasan for the potential treatment of COVID-19. We filed and received approval for an IND from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to initiate a Phase 1 study of emricasan in mild Covid-19 patients to assess safety and tolerability. Until such time as a strategic partner assumes responsibility, we, in collaboration with Amerimmune, shall be responsible for and shall control all regulatory interactions relating to emricasan. Under the Collaboration Agreement, Amerimmune, at its expense and in collaboration with us, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to lead the development activities for emricasan. Amerimmune shall be responsible for conducting clinical trials and Histogen shall provide reasonable quantities of emricasan for such purpose. We believe our current supply of emricasan is sufficient to support clinical trials through Phase 2. The parties have established a joint development committee to oversee the development of emricasan and a joint partnering committee to oversee commercialization activities for emricasan. Each party shall retain ownership of their legacy intellectual property and responsibility for ongoing patent application prosecution and maintenance costs. In addition, we granted Amerimmune an option, subject to certain terms and conditions related to partnering emricasan, to an exclusive license to develop and commercialize emricasan throughout the world during the term. After exercise of the option, Amerimmune, alone or in conjunction with one or more strategic partners, will use its commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize emricasan and we will equally share the profits with Amerimmune. 
Allergan License and Supply Agreements 
 In July 2017, we entered into a letter agreement to transfer Suneva Medical, Inc.’s Amended and Restated License and Supply Agreements (collectively the “Allergan Agreements”) to Allergan, which grants an exclusive license, including the right to sublicense to third parties, to use and commercialize our CCM skin care ingredient in the medical aesthetics market on a worldwide basis, excluding South Korea, China and India, in exchange for royalty payments to us based on Allergan’s sales of product including the licensed ingredient. Through December 31, 2020, we entered into several amendments to the Allergan Agreements to, among other things, expand Allergan’s license rights to certain sales channels where it’s products containing the CCM ingredient can be sold, identify exclusive and non-exclusive fields of use and clarify responsibilities with response to regulatory filings. For these amendments to the License Agreements, we have received cash payments of $19.5 million through December 31, 2020. The Allergan Agreements also include a potential future milestone payment of $5.5 million if Allergan’s net sales of products containing our CCM skin care ingredient exceeds $60 million in any calendar year through December 31, 2027. From time to time, we may improve our CCM skin care ingredient, and to the extent that these are within the field of use in the Allergan Agreements, we will provide the improvements to Allergan. The remaining performance obligations related to the Allergan Agreements from 2017 were our obligations to supply CCM and provide potential future improvements to Allergan, for which our obligation to supply CCM was satisfied during the fourth quarter of 2019. On January 17, 2020, we amended the Allergan Agreements, further clarifying the fields of use, the product definition and rights to certain improvements, as well as us agreeing to supply additional CCM and provide further technical assistance to Allergan (the cost of which shall be reimbursed to us), for a one-time payment of $1.0 million to us. Allergan may terminate the agreement for convenience upon one business days’ notice to us. Under the Amended and Restated License Agreement, as amended, Allergan will indemnify us for third party claims arising from Allergan’s breach of the agreement, negligence or willful misconduct, or the exploitation of products by Allergan or its sublicensees. We will indemnify Allergan for third party claims arising from its breach of the agreement, negligence or willful misconduct, or the exploitation of products by us prior to the effective date.Huapont License and Supply Agreement 
 On September 30, 2016, concurrent with the purchase of 4,000,000 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock and 190,377 shares of common stock by Pineworld Capital Limited (or “Huapont”) on August 10, 2016, Private Histogen and Huapont entered into an Exclusive License and Supply Agreement (“LSA”) that had been negotiated simultaneously with and in anticipation of the closing for the Huapont investment transaction. The LSA, among other provisions, grants limited exclusive license and sublicense rights to Huapont for the commercialization and sale of 
 5


HST-001 in the People’s Republic of China (the “territory”); and a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable right to our Trademarks in the territory. The agreement contains provisions for us to supply HST-001 to Huapont upon request for use in clinical trials and following regulatory approval in the defined territory, for which Huapont will reimburse us up to $150,000 in manufacturing costs. To date, no development activities have occurred and no supply of HST-001 has been requested by Huapont pursuant to the LSA. 
 We have a right to terminate the LSA upon failure by Huapont to achieve certain diligence or sales milestones or its abandonment of commercialization of the product, certain changes of control of Huapont, Huapont’s material breach of the LSA, Huapont’s failure to purchase certain volumes of product under the LSA, or Huapont’s sale of the product outside the territory or sale of a competing product, subject to certain cure rights. Huapont may terminate the agreement if further commercialization of the product is not commercially feasible, upon our material breach of the LSA or if we sell a competing product in the territory. Huapont will indemnify us for third-party claims arising from Huapont’s distribution, marketing and promotion of products in or for the territory, Huapont’s breach of the agreement or Huapont’s intentional acts or omissions or negligence. We will indemnify Huapont for the development, manufacture or supply of product by or under the control of us, our breach of our obligations or warranties, intellectual property infringement in connection with the using, importing or selling of products by Huapont, infringement of trademark rights in connection with the use of our trademarks, or our intentional acts or omissions or negligence. 
 Upon the adoption of ASC 606, we determined that as no up-front consideration was attributable to the LSA, there was no impact to the historical accounting for the arrangement, and therefore, no transition adjustment was required. The LSA includes development milestone payments of up to $5.0 million in aggregate; $0.8 million upon the approval of the IND by the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”); $1.8 million upon the completion of all clinical trials required for a New Drug Filing (“NDA”) with the CFDA; $1.2 million upon NDA filing with the CFDA; and $1.2 million upon NDA approval by the CFDA. In accordance with ASC 606, we excluded the development milestones from the transaction price as it considered such payments to be fully constrained under ASC 606 due to the inherent uncertainty in the achievement of such milestone payments, which are highly susceptible to factors outside of our control. We will recognize revenue for development milestone as it becomes probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur using the most likely method. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have not recognized any milestone revenue under the LSA. The arrangement also includes tiered royalty payments based on net sales of HST-001, consisting of 4% up to the first $50 million of net sales, 5.5% for net sales above $50.0 million and up to and inclusive of $125.0 million, 6.5% for net sales above $125.0 million and up to and inclusive of $200 million, and 7.5% above $200.0 million. Sales-based royalties promised in exchange for the license will be recognized as revenue in the period when subsequent sales occur. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not recognize any royalty revenue under the LSA. 
 PUR 
 PUR was formed to develop and market applications and products in the surgical/orthopedic and device markets. On April 5, 2019, Private Histogen entered into a Settlement, Release and Termination Agreement with PUR and its members (“PUR Settlement”), which terminated the License, Supply and Operating Agreements between Histogen and PUR, eliminated Private Histogen’s membership interest in PUR and returned all in-process research and development assets to Private Histogen (the “Development Assets”). The agreement also provided indemnification and complete release by all parties. As consideration for the reacquisition of the Development Assets, Private Histogen compensated PUR with both equity and cash components, including 1,166,667 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock with a fair value of $1.75 million and a potential cash payout of up to $6.25 million (the “Cap Amount”). Private Histogen paid PUR $0.5 million in upfront cash, forgave approximately $22 thousand of accounts receivable owed by PUR to Histogen, and settled an outstanding payable by PUR of approximately $23,000 owed to a third-party. We are also obligated to make milestone and royalty payments, including (a) $0.4 million upon the unconditional acceptance and approval of a New Drug Application or Pre-Market Approval Application by the US FDA related to the Development Assets, (b) $0.4 million commercialization milestone upon reaching gross sales (by Histogen or licensee) of the $0.5 million of products incorporating the Development Assets, and (c) a five percent (5%) royalty on net revenues collected by us from commercial sales (by us or licensee) of products incorporating the Development Assets. The aforementioned cash payments, along with any future milestone and royalty payments, are all applied against the Cap Amount.

Governmental Regulation
 FDA Regulation and Marketing Approval
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products, biological products, and medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, and other federal regulations. These FDA-regulated products are also subject to state and local statutes and regulations, as well as applicable laws or regulations in foreign countries. The FDA, and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries, impose substantial requirements on the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record-keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, marketing, sampling and import and export of FDA-regulated products. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions or non-approval of product candidates. These sanctions could include a clinical hold on clinical trials, FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large number of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 IND and Clinical Trials of Drug and Biological Products
 Prior to commencing a human clinical trial of a drug or biological product, an IND application, which contains the results of preclinical studies along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during drug development.
 An independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the investigational plan for the trial before it commences at that site. Informed written consent must be obtained from each trial subject.
 Human clinical trials for drug and biological products typically are conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:
  
• | Phase I—the investigational drug/biologic is given initially to healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition in order to determine metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, side effects and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug/biologic’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II—clinical trials are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug/biologic for a particular indication or in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug/biologic for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III—when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug/biologic appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase III clinical trials, Phase III clinical trials in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical sites may begin. They are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug/biologic and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, including good clinical practice (GCP) requirements, which are intended to protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants, define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors and ensure clinical trial data integrity. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.
 During the development of a new drug or biologic, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II clinical trials, and before an NDA/BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end-of-Phase II clinical trials meetings to discuss their Phase II clinical trials results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III registration trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug/biologic.
 An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in the same dosage form must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product. This typically requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, biologics, and devices, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial, is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors also are obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the clinical trial results can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
The New Drug Application (NDA) Approval Process
 Our drug products must be approved by the FDA through the NDA approval process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practice or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND application;
--+----------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and audit of clinical trial sites; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of an NDA.
--+------------------------

 In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment (exceeding $2.5 million in fiscal year 2019) unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical studies, or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other information. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.

Companies also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for the NDA sponsor’s manufacturing the product in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate, and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the finished drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
 The results of drug development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing.
 If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs within 12 months from submission of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA, it will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or effectiveness to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, BLA or PMA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. We currently have manufacturing facilities at our corporate headquarters, but we intend to facilitate a technology transfer of such functions and obligations to third party contract research organizations, for its clinical materials, and certain of its commercial partners for their commercial supply. Until such time as we no longer manufacture any clinical or commercial supply of product, we must ensure that our facilities satisfy FDA manufacturing requirements. Additionally, before approving an NDA, BLA or PMA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites for compliance with GCP regulations.
 If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP regulations, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

As a condition of approval, the FDA may require, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials may be a condition for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase IV clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA now has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.
 The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”), which is the most restrictive REMS. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases the approval date may be delayed. Once implemented, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products in development. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide a process for listing patents pertaining to approved products in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) and for a competitor seeking approval of an application that references a product with listed patents to make certifications pertaining to such patents. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Patent Term Restoration
 Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during drug development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed by the NDA holder in the drug’s application or otherwise are published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA permits marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s) in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under and ANDA are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.
 Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (ii) such patent has expired; (iii) the date on which such patent expires; or (iv) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant also may elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
 Market Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain drug applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification.
 The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, were conducted or sponsored by the applicant deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active ingredient. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA is required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 11


The Biologics License Application (BLA) Approval Process
 Our biological products must be approved by the FDA through the BLA approval process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process is similar to the NDA process and generally involves the completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, submission of an IDA application, performance of human clinical trials in accordance with GCP to establish and safety and efficacy of the biological product, submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials, FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and audit of clinical trial sites; and FDA approval of a BLA.
 The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Each BLA submission requires a user fee payment (exceeding $2.5 million in fiscal year 2019), unless a waiver or exemption applies. The manufacturer or sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual establishment fees.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most applications for standard review biologics products are reviewed within twelve months of submission, and most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within eight months of submission. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologics products or biologics products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory, and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe and effective for the indication studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA’s general rules on biological products.
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, including additional large-scale clinical testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product’s potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems or safety issues are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, device components or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
 12


Biosimilar Exclusivity
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar products. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from an existing FDA-licensed reference product. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior licensed product if it is biosimilar and meets additional requirements under the BPCIA, including that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. An interchangeable product may be substituted for the reference product without the involvement of the prescriber.
 A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar may be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product may obtain exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar; (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge; (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant; or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 FDA Regulation of Medical Devices
 Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States, and laws and regulations of foreign authorities in other countries. FDA requirements specific to medical devices are wide ranging and govern, among other things:
  
• | design, development and manufacturing;
--+---------------------------------------


• | testing, labeling and storage;
--+-------------------------------


• | clinical trials in humans;
--+---------------------------


• | product safety;
--+----------------


• | marketing, sales and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------


• | premarket clearance or approval;
--+---------------------------------


• | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to serious injury or death; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product export.
--+----------------

 Unless an exemption applies, medical devices distributed in the United States must receive either premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or premarket approval of a premarket application (PMA). Medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree or risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Medical devices deemed to pose relatively low risk are placed in either Class I or II, which generally requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission for commercial distribution. Some low risk devices are exempted from this premarket requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device, or to a “preamendment device”—i.e., a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications—are placed in Class III requiring PMA approval.
 13


Clinical Studies of Medical Devices under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA. All clinical investigations of investigational devices must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators.
 If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health (as defined in the regulations), the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. Both significant risk and nonsignificant risk investigational devices require approval from institutional review boards (IRBs) at the study centers where the device will be used. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials.
 An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
 During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements. The sponsor, the FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of the product.
 The Premarket Application (PMA) Approval Pathway
 A product not eligible for 510(k) clearance must follow the PMA approval pathway, which requires evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. FDA aims to review PMAs within 12 months, but approval in practice could take much longer.
 A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. As part of the PMA review, the FDA typically will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation (QSR) requirements, which impose requirements for design and development, manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, distribution, and documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
 Upon submission, the FDA determines if the PMA application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and, if so, the application is accepted for filing. The FDA then commences an in-depth review of the PMA application, which typically takes one to three years, but may last longer. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA is typically convened to review and evaluate the PMA applications and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approval of the device. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process.
 Post-Marketing Requirements for FDA Regulated Products
 Following approval of a new product, the company and the approved products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting adverse experiences to the applicable regulatory authorities, providing regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, manufacturing products in accordance with cGMP requirements, product 
 14


sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising and restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not consistent with the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet, including social media. Although physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval, or may include in a lengthy review process.
 The FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities, which may include the following:
  
• | untitled letters or warning letters;
--+-------------------------------------


• | fines, disgorgement, restitution or civil penalties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions (e.g., total or partial suspension of production) or consent decrees;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product recalls, administrative detention, or seizure;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delays in or refusal to grant requests for future product approvals or foreign regulatory approvals of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawals or suspensions of FDA product marketing approvals or foreign regulatory approvals, resulting in prohibitions on product sales;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical holds on clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------


• | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 In the U.S., after a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in registered facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We expect to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct deviations from cGMP. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs, biologics and medical devices are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 NDA/BLA/PMA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms and, in certain circumstances, suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that can interrupt the operation of any such firm or result in restrictions on product supply, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 15


Newly-discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 Reimbursement, Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
 In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the privacy regulations promulgated under HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-government payors.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a clinical trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health 
 16


insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be priced significantly lower than in the U.S.
 As noted above, in the U.S., we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, or other good or service for which payment in whole or in part may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices or our future relationships with medical professionals might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a federal False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a federal False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
 There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.
 The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (1) changes to our manufacturing facility; (2) additions or modifications to product labeling; 
 17


(3) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (4) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

• | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of the AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The CMS have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the U.S. as well. In addition, the PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.

• | In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. The PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly-eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The PPACA imposes a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The PPACA imposes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The PPACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to track this information and were required to make their first reports in March 2014. The information reported is publicly available on a searchable website.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18


 
• | The PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and, at this time, the full effect of the PPACA on our business remains unclear. Further, there have been recent public announcements by members of the federal government regarding their plans to repeal and replace the PPACA. For example, on December 22, 2017, former President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which, among other things, eliminated the individual mandate requiring most Americans (other than those who qualify for a hardship exemption) to carry a minimum level of health coverage, effective January 1, 2019. We cannot predict the ultimate form or timing of any repeal or replacement of the PPACA or the effect such a repeal or replacement would have on our business.
 Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls
 We have successfully developed production processes that are scalable and economically viable. All of the derivatives of the manufacturing process can be used, creating a spectrum of products for a variety of markets from one core technology.
 We have established in-house research, development and manufacturing capabilities in our corporate headquarters; however, we do not intend to continue manufacturing commercial or clinical material in-house moving forward. We intend to secure manufacturing agreements with a contract manufacturing organization for our own clinical and commercial supply. Currently, we are not a party to any manufacturing agreements.
 We currently manufacture commercial quantities of our CCM skin care ingredient for Allergan, who formulates the ingredient into their skin care product lines. However, we are in the process of conducting a technology transfer to Allergan, which will enable our commercial partner to utilize their own or third-party facilities. As of January 2021, we successfully completed the technology transfer to Allergan and our obligations to manufacture commercial quantities of CCM under the 2017 License and Supply Agreements.
 Intellectual Property
 As of February 1, 2021, we hold or control 11 issued U.S. patents, six pending U.S. patent applications, and 40 patents in various jurisdictions outside the United States related to our product candidates and core technology. Additionally, we are pursuing 24 corresponding patent applications that are pending in various foreign jurisdictions, including two applications that are pending in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”). Further advancement of our intellectual property portfolio will require the filing of patent applications related to our proprietary manufacturing process and product candidates. We have patents extending into the late 2020s, and 2030 as well as trade secrets protecting our intellectual property. Our patent prosecution strategy includes exploration of opportunities to expand our patent life in order to broaden our existing patent portfolio.
 Below is a further description of certain of our key issued patents, including the method of protection, expiration date, number of related patents issued in foreign jurisdictions and the product candidates to which each patent relates. We currently hold or control:
  
• | three patents issued in the United States (U.S. Patent Nos. 10,538,736, 8,257,947 and 8,524,494) and thirty-one patents issued in foreign jurisdictions directed to the production and use of extracellular matrix compositions and more specifically to proteins obtained by culturing cells under hypoxic conditions on a microcarrier beads or a three-dimensional surface in a suitable growth medium. The culturing method

produces both soluble and non-soluble fractions, which may be used separately or in combination to obtain physiologically acceptable compositions useful in a variety of medical and therapeutic applications. These U.S. patents relate to HST-001, HST-002, HST-003, HST-004 and HST-005 and are expected to expire between January 2029 and 2030, while patents issued in foreign jurisdictions are expected to expire in July 2030;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one patent issued in the United States (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,535,913), which is also directed to the production and use of extracellular matrix compositions and more specifically to proteins obtained by culturing cells under hypoxic conditions on a surface in a suitable growth medium useful for promoting hair growth. This U.S. patent relates to HST-001 and it is expected to expire in January 30, 2029;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two patents issued in the United States (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,530,415 and 9,512,403), which are also directed to the production of a tissue patch for the repair and regeneration of cells and methods of use using of extracellular matrix compositions and more specifically to proteins obtained by culturing cells under hypoxic conditions on microcarrier beads or a three-dimensional a surface in a suitable growth medium. These U.S. patents relate to HST-003, HST-004 and HST-005 and are expected to expire January to March 2029; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | four patents issued in the United States (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,852,637, 9,034,312, 9,506,038, 10,143,708) and fourteen patents issued in foreign jurisdictions related to extracellular matrix compositions for the treatment of cancer, which are scheduled to expire between January 2029 and November 2030, while patents issued in foreign jurisdictions are expected to expire in January 2029; and one pending U.S. application related to skin care.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, as of February 1, 2021, we hold or control one United States patent and corresponding foreign patents directed to crystalline forms of emricasan. Foreign patents have been granted in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Taiwan. We expect that the crystalline forms and methods of use patent, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, will expire in 2028 (United States) and 2027 (international). It is possible that the term of a crystalline forms patent in the United States could be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Patent term extension may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval. This patent portfolio also includes patent applications directed to composition of matter and methods of use for its internally developed caspase inhibitors, including CTS-2090.
 Wherever possible, we seek to protect our inventions by filing U.S. patents as well as foreign counterpart applications in select other countries. Because patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for at least eighteen months after the applications are filed, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of inventions set forth in such patent applications. Our planned or potential products may be covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, in which case continued development and marketing of its products would require a license. Required licenses may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain these licenses, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design around the patents, or we could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses are not possible.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on know-how, trade secrets and the careful monitoring of proprietary information, all of which can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect some of our proprietary technology and processes by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. These agreements may be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees or our consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Competition
 Both the biopharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and experience in research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing products.
 While we believe our proprietary manufacturing process, focus on addressing underserved, multibillion-dollar global markets, in-house research and development, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources offer competitive advantages, we face competition in the biopharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries. The key competitive factors affecting the success of HST-001, HST-003 and the emricasan asset are successful completion of clinical trials and timely regulatory approval in markets worldwide.
 HST-001
 Competition in the pharmaceutical market for the treatment of alopecia (hair loss), specifically androgenic alopecia, consists of the following:
  
• | Although hair restoration treatments range in effectiveness and invasiveness, one thing all of the currently available treatments share is that they target the existing hair and hair follicles, and work to save them.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hair regrowth with topical options, such as Rogaine and Propecia, is minimal, and is lost upon discontinued use of the selected product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hair loss products currently on the market or in active clinical development include: Allergan’s setipriprant, RepliCel’s RCH-01, Kerastem’s Style, Samumed’s SM-04554, Cassiopea’s Breezula, Johnson & Johnson’s Rogaine, Merck’s Propecia, PhotoMedex’s Tricomin and often as a last resort, a surgical hair transplant.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) is an experimental therapy in which a patient’s blood is drawn, processed and then injected into the scalp.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The development of HST-001 has the potential to expand the hair restoration market by offering a successful option to those that currently have none, and a potentially more effective option to anyone presently using or considering current treatment options, such as Rogaine or Propecia.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Certain treatment options may be limited in their effectiveness and only reduce hair loss, as opposed to growing new hair.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 HST-003
 Competition in the pharmaceutical market for regenerating hyaline cartilage for the treatment of articular cartilage defects, consists of the following:
  
• | Physicians, and their patients, are seeking treatments that reverse cartilage degeneration.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Less invasive procedures are preferred to preserve patient function and reduce surgical complications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients seek treatment options with shorter recovery periods and lasting treatment mechanisms that can promote more durable articular cartilage healing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current treatment options fall into four key therapeutics categories, opioid, analgesic, cell/stem cell or disease modifying.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cartilage repair products currently on the market or in active clinical development include: Collegium’s COL 003, Adhera’s IT-102, Cytori’s adipose derived stem cells, Stempeucetics’ Stempeucel, Samumed’s SM-04690 and Medivir AB’s MIV-711.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


Emricasan
 Currently there is no competition in the pharmaceutical market for the treatment of COVID-19 using a pan-caspase inhibitor:
  
• | COVID-19 is a multiple system disease that affects the lungs, circulatory system, the brain, kidney and other organs. Patients show a widespread of severity, some which remain asymptomatic, and others that progress all the way to rapid health deterioration, including death due to organ failure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients that show greater morbidity and mortality are typically characterized by lymphopenia, a rapid decline in white blood cells. Preliminary studies indicate that lymphopenia is associated with more severe disease and outcomes. Emricasan targets Caspase-1 which is believes to be a key enzyme that when activated leads to lymphopenia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Physicians, and their patients, are seeking treatment options that will shorten recovery periods and prevent progression of the disease and its severity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current non-vaccine treatment options fall into several therapeutic categories geared toward interfering with different aspects of the disease, including RNA polymerase to prevent replication of the virus, general anti-inflammatory drugs, and monoclonal antibodies to interfere with cellular receptors to prevent uptake of the virus.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Currently, there are no caspase inhibitors that are targeting the same mechanism of action, such as prevention of lymphopenia.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other treatments which aim to interfere with different aspects of the disease that are currently on the market as FDA approved drugs, under a FDA EUA or in active clinical development include: Remdesivir/Veklury (approved RNApol inhibitor), Dexamethasone (corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory), Bamlanivimab (Lilly, anti-COVID mAbs), and Casirivmab/Imdevimab (Regeneron, anti-COVID mAbs), Bamlaniviman/etesevimab combination (Lilly, anti-COVID mAbs combination), baricitinib/remdesivir combination (Lilly; combination treatment of remdesivir with a janus kinase inhibitor).
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 19 full-time employees and 15 of our employees are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
