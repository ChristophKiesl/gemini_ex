Company History

Ethema Health Corporation (formerly known as Greenestone Healthcare Corporation) (the “Company” or “Ethema” or “GreeneStone”), a Colorado corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on April 1, 1993 (“Greenestone” or the “Company”), and is the surviving company of a merger, effective February 1, 1995, between the Company and Nova Natural Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Nova Delaware”). The merger was effectuated solely for the purpose of changing the Company’s domicile from Delaware to Colorado. At all times prior to 2001, the Company was engaged in the oil and gas exploration business. Nova Delaware was the successor entity to Nova Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Power Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which merged in 1986 (“the 1986 Merger”). Prior to the 1986 Merger, Nova Petroleum Corporation and Power Resources Corporation had operated since 1979 and 1972, respectively. In 2001, the Company entered into the electronics business and this business was active in 2001 and 2002, as part of the Torita Group. After 2002, the Company continued with various stages of development in this business until 2010.


On April 1, 2010, the Company changed its principal operations from development stage electronics to healthcare services. On March 29, 2010, the Company entered into a one year consulting agreement with Greenestone Clinic Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Greenestone Clinic”), whereby Greenestone Clinic provided consulting services for the Company’s development and operation of medical clinics in the province of Ontario, Canada. Specifically, Greenestone Clinic provided medical and business expertise in the initial startup of private clinics and technical assistance to ensure that the clinics were in compliance with governmental policy and procedure requirements as well as any operational requirements. At the time of entering into this consulting agreement, Greenestone Clinic operated a clinic at the Muskoka property housing its addiction treatment clinic and provided endoscopy services. The Company started offering medical services in June 2010, offering various medical services, including endoscopy, cardiology and executive medicals, which services were subsequently sold.
 
On May 15, 2010, the Company secured a sublease of space (which was previously the Rothbart Pain Clinic) of approximately 8,000 sq. ft. to be used as the Company’s executive offices and to run an endoscopy clinic. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary GreeneStone Clinic Muskoka Inc. (“GreeneStone Muskoka”), also entered into a lease with the owner of the Muskoka premises on April 1, 2011 and provided mental health and addiction treatment services and operated an in- patient addiction treatment center at this location.
 
Recent Developments
 
On February 14, 2017, GreeneStone completed a series of transactions (referred to collectively as the “Restructuring Transactions”), including a share purchase agreement (the “SPA”) whereby GreeneStone acquired the stock of the company holding the Muskoka Healthcare Clinic real estate, an asset purchase agreement (the “APA”) and lease (the “Lease”) whereby the Company sold all of the Muskoka clinic business assets and leased the clinic building to the buyer, and a real estate purchase agreement and asset purchase agreement whereby GreeneStone purchased the real estate and business assets of Seastone Delray (the “Florida Purchase”).
The Stock Purchase Agreement
 
Under the SPA, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Cranberry Cove Holdings Ltd. (“CCH”) from Leon Developments Ltd. (“Leon Developments”), a company wholly owned by Shawn E. Leon, who is the President, CEO, and CFO of GreeneStone (“Mr. Leon”). CCH owns the real estate on which the Company’s rehabilitation clinic (“the Canadian Rehab Clinic”) in Muskoka, Ontario is located. The total consideration paid by GreeneStone was CDN$3,300,000 (an appraised value of CDN$10,000,000 less the outstanding mortgage loan), which was funded by the assignment to Leon Developments of certain indebtedness owing to GreeneStone in the amount of CDN$659,918, and the issuance of 60,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to Leon Developments, valued at approximately US$0.033 per share (the “Shares”).

The Asset Purchase Agreement and Lease
 
Under the APA, the assets of the Canadian Rehab Clinic were sold by GreeneStone, through its subsidiary, GreeneStone Clinic Muskoka Inc. (the “Rehab Clinic Subsidiary”), to Canadian Addiction Residential Treatment LP (the “Purchaser”), for a total consideration of CDN$10,000,000, plus an additional performance payment of up to CDN$3,000,000 performance payment to be received in 2019 if certain clinic performance metrics are met. The Purchaser completed the sale with cash proceeds to the Company of CDN$10,000,000, of which CDN$1,500,000 will remain in escrow for up to two years to cover indemnities given by the Company. Aside from using the proceeds of the Muskoka clinic asset sale to pay down significant tax debts and operational costs of the Company, the Company also used the proceeds to fund the Florida Purchase.


Through the APA, substantially all of the assets of the Rehab Clinic Subsidiary were sold, leaving GreeneStone with only the underlying clinic real estate, which GreeneStone through its newly acquired subsidiary CCH concurrently leased to the Purchaser. The Lease is a triple net lease and provides for a five (5) year primary term with three (3) five year renewal options, annual base rent for the first year at CDN$420,000 with annual increases, an option to tenant to purchase the leased premises and certain first refusal rights.

Immediately after closing on the sale of its Muskoka clinic business, On February 14, 2017, GreeneStone closed on the acquisition of the Seastone Business and real estate assets. The purchase price for the Florida transaction was $6,150,000, which is being funded by a purchase money first mortgage in the amount of $3,000,000 at 5% per annum payable at $15,000 per month for three years; and $3,150,000 in cash. The Seastone Business is now the primary business of GreeneStone and it is being operated through its wholly owned subsidiary Seastone Delray Healthcare, LLC.

Marketing
 
The addiction treatment business operates as a private pay service. The customers get no government subsidy to attend our treatment facility. The decision to attend the treatment center is made by each individual, making it important to market our services to the individual. There are a large number of mental health professionals that refer to the treatment center and we ensure that we maintain contact with and market to these professionals. Our marketing efforts are long term processes of establishing relationships with relevant professionals and our treatment staff. We use industry specific conferences and functions to network with these professionals.
 
Approximately 70% of our clients are sourced via the Internet. This is the single biggest focus for our marketing team, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is very important and the Company aggressively seeks the maximum cost/benefit relationships with specialist firms in this field. We believe our marketing efforts are successful and effective.
 
Competition
 
There are hundreds of private paid facilities in the United States and they collectively, represent a major competitor for those with the ability to pay for addiction services. Addiction service facilities in the United States that offer the same level of treatment offered by our Company are generally 50% to 100% more expensive than we are.
Environmental Regulations
 
The Company is not currently subject to any pending administrative or judicial enforcement proceedings arising under environmental laws or regulations. Environmental laws and regulations may be adopted in the future which may have an impact upon the Company’s operations.
