Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are an artificial intelligence driven platform and course designer that rapidly provides customized, high performance and scalable online products for schools and businesses. We use machine learning to provide a novel, mass customized experience to learners. Our customers are businesses, universities and colleges and K-12 schools. We are passionate about improving the learner experience and learner outcomes in online learning products, and improving our customers’ ability to create and deliver both. We are focused on creating the best possible technology solutions and have been awarded an innovation award for our product. We are committed to our team, and have twice been recognized with workplace excellence awards.
Our Strategy
 
We work closely with our customers to deliver online learning products. Our business model offers flexibility for our customers, either in sharing revenue or in licensing our platform and paying fees to us to create, launch and maintain learning products. We have entered into master service agreements with our customers, including, but not limited to, universities and The Henry Ford, as well as statements of work detailing the services to be rendered and programs or products to be delivered on the platform. We convert customer content onto our proprietary platform, or generate content for our customers, and use the proprietary data we collect on learner behavior and responses with their consent, to deliver to learners engaging, effective college courses. We aim to reduce the cost of delivering outstanding online learning products, and improve learner experience and performance.
 
We adapt to market needs for learning by adapting our platform’s back-end software (“codestack”) to deliver products our customers need. Educational institutions (EIs) and businesses have many needs for online tools and products that involve learning, beyond traditional courses, modules or programs. Our codestack offers the ability to curate information in real time for our customers and our business model enables us to generate content rapidly. Thus, we consider it a core part of our business to be continually seeking opportunities to adapt our platform into new areas.
 
Our Proprietary Technology
 
We believe that online learning products are essential for accessibility, engagement and scalability for educational institutions and businesses alike. We utilize artificial intelligence to achieve improved engagement, and continuous integration of current, qualified information into our learning products.
 
Our technology utilizes a flexible and scalable full stack solution, with robust tools powering front-end technology. Our code architecture offers outstanding accessibility and agility for engineers, using best-in-class languages for both client and server-side functions. We also use tools employed by many high-end platforms, including Netflix and PayPal. Our architecture enables us to achieve full integration of best-in-class third party tools, and custom-built features, delivering on-demand and as-needed, such as leading calendar platform integrations, and high quality, encrypted video calling.
 
Our architecture enables us to utilize artificial intelligence algorithms to ultimately improve learning outcomes. Much as artificial intelligence algorithms presently recognize, and respond to natural language on commercial platforms, predict behaviors and deliver suggestions, our algorithms have been developed to assist learners in accessing, utilizing and remaining engaged with platform content, their instructors and their peers.

We generate content for our customers using the highest standards in academia and business, and our business model enables us to deliver content for our customers efficiently and rapidly. Rapidly evolving technology has driven the need to continuously upskill students and workforces, and we use the highest possible standards to deliver this content according to customer needs. This substantially reduces the time it takes for traditional program creation by EIs or businesses.
 
We market to our customers, and enable them to offer and monetize learning products, or to deliver learning products to their own employees efficiently and cost effectively. Our customers want the capability of delivery to their own customers, and are best able to market to them. We deliver the content and technology to enable this.
 
We protect and utilize learner data solely to improve learning outcomes. Learner data is collected with learner permission, and information about learner behavior, study preferences and preference for types of material delivered as part of learning products, will be used to improve learning outcomes and learner experiences. We will validate algorithms using both offline and online testing. By correlating learner behaviors with specific outcomes as identified by qualified instructors, we will train our algorithms specifically for important learning outcomes, enabling it to be a useful tool for instructors. We believe that the combinations of information that will be collected through our educational products, and outcomes measured using our online learning products will be unique, and constantly improved. We will never sell or distribute our learner data to third parties without the explicit permission of learners. We will not deliver unwanted content or advertising to learners or to customer personnel. Our proprietary technology is developed solely for purposes of improving learner experiences and outcomes, and improving the ability of our customers to deliver outstanding educational products.
 
Our Research and Development Programs
 
We use advanced technologies to create effective and accessible learning environments. We seek to improve learning at many levels, including K-12, college and professional. Our research and development programs will expand continuously based on learner preferences, outcomes and the desires of our customers. Some of these will include:

● | Improvements in learner engagement with cloud-based platforms. We will continuously gather data on how learners engage with us and other online platforms, and conduct research and development to create and incorporate useful tools for learning on our platform.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improvements in instructor experience using our platform. We will continuously develop tools designed to improve the ability of our customers to deliver timely and relevant content, deliver assessments which are fair, correctly represent educational objectives and give repeatable outcomes when employed on our platform.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integration of new technology in the delivery of learning products. We will continuously develop improvements to our technology stack, inventing and integrating best-in-class online engagement features. These will range from invention of novel user experience features, to integration of capabilities offered by other vendors and developers. A “technology stack” is a combination of software products and programming languages used to create our platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Qualification of information for use by learners in all sectors. We plan to provide both our customers and our learners with the constantly improving ability to find and integrate qualified information into products on our platform, and maximize learner ability to utilize qualified information, designed to offer learners the most carefully curated, most relevant, timely and engaging materials in every discipline in which we offer products.

We have protected our source codes, methodologies, algorithms, and techniques directed to other aspects of our artificial intelligence learning platform using our trade secret rights. We have filed intent-to-use trademarks for AMESITETM and KEEP LEARNINGTM with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also secured domain names, including amesite.com, amesite.co, amesite.net, and others.
 
We ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party that creates intellectual property for us or that assign any intellectual property rights to us. Portions of our platform may rely upon third-party licensed intellectual property.
 
We have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and entities with which we conduct business.
 
Competition
 
The on-line and software industries for higher education are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition, government regulation, and strong defense of intellectual property. The overall market for technology solutions that enable providers to deliver education online is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting needs of learners and educators and frequent introductions of new methods of delivering education online. While we believe that our platform, programs, technology, knowledge, experience, and resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major on-line companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions, among others.
 
Any learning product that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current learning products. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other course offerings include efficiency, security and convenience, and availability. Our competitors fall primarily into the following groups:
 

● | Online Program Management (OPM) firms, who create and launch educational products for EIs and businesses, using either their own or others’ Learning Management Systems (LMSs).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Learning Management System (LMS) technology firms, who offer technology platforms suitable for offering online educational or training products
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Learning product aggregators, who offer multiple institutions’ or businesses’ learning products on online platforms for direct purchase by learners, or through licenses by institutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of the companies, colleges, or universities against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in education, software design and development, and have already obtained approvals and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified engineers, scientists, and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
We expect that the competitive landscape will continue to expand as the market for online programs at nonprofit institutions matures. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 

● | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


● | ability of online programs to deliver desired learner outcomes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | robustness and evolution of technology offering; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | breadth and depth of service offering.
--+---------------------------------------

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
The education industry is heavily regulated. Institutions of higher education that award degrees and certificates to signify the successful completion of an academic program are subject to regulation from three primary entities, namely, the U.S. Department of Education, or DOE, accrediting agencies, and state licensing authorities. Each of these entities promulgates and enforces its own laws, regulations and standards, which we refer to collectively as education laws.
 
We contract with higher education institutions that are subject to education laws. In addition, we are required to comply with certain education laws as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions of higher education, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with customers. Our failure, or that of our customers, to comply with education laws could adversely impact our operations. As a result, we work closely with our customers to maintain compliance with education laws.

We will abide, as required, by the education laws, including incentive compensation rule, misrepresentation rule, accreditation rules and standards, among all state and federal regulations. We also closely monitor state law developments and we will work closely with our customers to assist them with obtaining any required approvals.
 
Our activities on behalf of our customers are also subject to other federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, consumer marketing and unfair trade practices laws and regulations, including those promulgated and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as federal and state data protection and privacy requirements.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We plan to grow our sales and marketing program as we build our customer base, advancing from our small, direct sales force to a distribution network that has existing relationships with K-12 schools, colleges, universities and businesses.
 
We also intend to develop a branding strategy to introduce and support our platform. The strategy may include our presence at K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions on a national, state, and regional basis to engage and educate users of our products, as well as engaging in a variety of other direct marketing methods to educational institutions and businesses.
