ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Intelligent Systems Corporation, a Georgia corporation, and its predecessor companies have operated since 1973 and its securities have been publicly traded since 1981. In this report, sometimes we use the terms “company”, “us”, “ours”, “we”, “Registrant” and similar words to refer to Intelligent Systems Corporation and subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 4355 Shackleford Road, Norcross, Georgia 30093 and our telephone number is (770) 381-2900. Our Internet address is www.intelsys.com. We publish our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with or furnish them to the SEC, and shareholders may access and download these reports free of charge. 
 
On March 31, 2015, we sold our largest operating subsidiary, ChemFree Corporation to CRC Industries, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (“CRC”). ChemFree manufactures and markets a line of parts washers under the SmartWasher® trademark. Accordingly, we have classified the ChemFree operations as discontinued operations in all periods presented. 
 
Following the sale of ChemFree, we are primarily engaged in the business of providing technology solutions and processing services to the financial technology and services market, commonly referred to as the FinTech industry. Our FinTech operations are conducted through our CoreCard Software, Inc. (“CoreCard”) subsidiary and its affiliate companies in Romania and India, as well as the corporate office which provides significant administrative, human resources and executive management support to CoreCard. Effective January 1, 2017, we increased our ownership in CoreCard from approximately 96 percent to 100 percent. We also have two other wholly owned subsidiaries, CoreCard SRL in Romania and ISC Software in India, that perform software development and testing as well as processing operations support for CoreCard.
 
For further information about trends and risks likely to impact our business, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 
CoreCard Software, Inc. – We conduct our business primarily through CoreCard. Our wholly owned subsidiaries, CoreCard SRL and ISC Software in Romania and India, respectively, perform software development and testing for CoreCard but do not sell products or services to third parties. Accordingly, this discussion describes the CoreCard business involving the three entities as a single business unit. CoreCard designs, develops, and markets a comprehensive suite of software solutions to accounts receivable businesses, financial institutions, retailers and processors to manage their credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, private label cards, fleet cards, loyalty programs, and accounts receivable and small loan transactions. CoreCard also uses the same software solutions in its processing operations for companies that prefer to outsource this function to CoreCard rather than license the software for in-house operations.
 
The CoreCard® software solutions allow companies to offer various types of debit and credit cards as well as revolving loans, to set up and maintain account data, to record advances and payments, to assess fees, interest and other charges, to resolve disputes and chargebacks, to manage collections of accounts receivable, to generate reports and to settle transactions with financial institutions and network associations.

The CoreCard® proprietary software applications are based on CoreCard’s core financial transaction processing platform (CoreENGINE™) and address the unique requirements of customers and program managers that issue or process:
 

● | Credit/Debit Cards/Loans – revolving or non-revolving credit issued to consumer or business accounts (with or without a physical card) that typically involve interest, fees, settlement, collections, etc. Within this market, CoreCard offers software specifically tailored to handle private label cards, network branded (i.e. MasterCard or VISA) bank cards, fleet cards, short-term consumer loans and revolving accounts receivable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prepaid Cards – pre-loaded funds drawn down for purchase or cash withdrawal typically involving a variety of fees but no interest. Numerous examples exist including gift cards, loyalty/reward cards, health benefit cards, payroll and benefits disbursement, student aid disbursement, government assistance payments, corporate expense cards, and transit cards.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The CoreCard® software solutions allow financial institutions and commercial customers to optimize their card account management systems, improve customer retention, lower operating costs and create greater market differentiation. For example, the CoreCard® solutions are feature-rich, browser-based financial transaction processing solutions that allow customers to automate, streamline and optimize business processes associated with the set-up, administration, management and settlement of credit, prepaid and loan accounts, to process transactions, and to generate reports and statements for these accounts. In addition, because the CoreCard products are designed to run on lower cost, scalable PC-based servers, rather than expensive legacy mainframe computers, customers may benefit from a lower overall cost-of-ownership and scalability by adding additional servers as their card volume grows. The CoreCard product functionality includes embedded multi-lingual, multi-currency support, web-based interface, real-time processing, complex rules-based authorizations, account hierarchies, and robust fee libraries. These features support customer-defined pricing and payment terms and allow CoreCard’s customers to create new and innovative card programs to differentiate themselves in the marketplace and improve customer retention. 
 
We believe CoreCard is unique among software companies because it offers a full array of card and account management software solutions, available either for in-house license or outsourced processing by CoreCard’s processing business (“Processing Services”) at the customer’s option. CoreCard also provides customers with a unique option to license the same CoreCard software that is used in the CoreCard processing environment and transfer it in-house for customer controlled processing at a later date. 
 

● | License - Typically CoreCard sells a software license to a customer who then runs the CoreCard software system, configured for the customer’s unique requirements, at a customer controlled location.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Processing Services - CoreCard has expanded the ways customers can access or deploy its software by offering processing services that allow customers to outsource their card processing requirements to CoreCard. CoreCard manages all aspects of the processing functions using its proprietary software configured for each processing customer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue to add resources to expand upon our infrastructure investment to support CoreCard’s Processing Services line of business. CoreCard processes both prepaid cards and credit financing for a number of customers and anticipates steadily growing this business further in 2017 as it adds new processing customers. CoreCard has a data processing center and disaster recovery site at secure third party locations, is certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards and has an SSAE-16 SOC 1 independent audit report that can be relied on by its prepaid and credit processing customers. It has obtained certification from the Discover, MasterCard, Star and Pulse networks and expects to complete direct connections and certification by other major network associations in 2017. 
 
CoreCard has relationships with several financial institutions that are important for network certification, referrals for processing or program managers, and sponsoring prospective card programs. 
 
In 2015, CoreCard added Program Manager capabilities in addition to processing services, which will allow us to gain experience and increase revenue potential, although we do not expect any significant revenue impact near term. 
 
CoreCard’s principal target markets include accounts receivable businesses, prepaid card issuers, retail and private-label issuers, small third-party processors, and small and mid-size financial institutions in the United States. It is adding customers in international markets as well. CoreCard competes with third-party card processors that allow customers to outsource their account transaction processing rather than acquire software to manage their transactions in-house. CoreCard also competes to some extent with larger and more established software suppliers, and a number of software solution providers that offer more limited functional modules. Some of CoreCard’s competitors, especially certain processors, have significantly more financial, marketing and development resources than does CoreCard and have large, established customer bases often tied to long-term contracts. CoreCard believes it can compete successfully in its selected markets by providing to its licensed software customers a robust technology platform, lower overall cost-of-ownership, greater system flexibility, and more customer-driven marketing options. Furthermore, we believe our processing option is an attractive alternative particularly for small, prepaid and credit issuers or companies entering new credit or prepaid markets that may not have the technology expertise to run the software in-house initially. Under our processing option, customers can contract with CoreCard to provide processing services for their accounts using CoreCard software configured to the customer’s preferences, with an option to license the same software and bring it in-house when and if the customer decides to become its own processor in the future. We believe this transition path for customers is unique in the industry.

The CoreCard® software platform and modules include CoreENGINE™, CoreISSUE™, CoreFraud™, CoreCOLLECT™, CoreSALES™, CoreAPP™, CoreMONEY™ and CoreAcquire™. Using a proprietary, base transaction processing platform called CoreENGINE, the CoreCard application modules have been further enhanced to meet the specific requirements of different market segments; for instance, CoreISSUE is available in different versions tailored to the requirements for issuing prepaid cards, fleet cards, bank cards or private label cards/accounts as well as accounts receivable management. In addition, CoreCard configures and/or customizes its robust base modules with additional or specific functionality to meet each customer’s requirements. The company has developed and sold such products to customers in the prepaid, fleet, private label, retail and credit markets. As is typical of most software companies, CoreCard expects to continually enhance and upgrade its existing software solutions and to develop additional modules to meet changing customer and market requirements. To date, CoreCard has focused its extensive development and limited sales activities on building a base of customers in each of its target markets, as well as putting in place the infrastructure and processes to be able to scale the business successfully, particularly for the processing services business.
 
Historically, most of the company’s sales have resulted from prospects contacting CoreCard based on an online search. CoreCard typically sells its products directly to customers, often in competitive situations, with relatively long sales and implementation cycles. 
 
We have several revenue streams. We receive software license fees that vary depending upon the number of licensed users and the number of software modules licensed with initial contract revenue typically ranging from $200,000 to $1 million. We also derive service revenue from implementation, customization, and annual maintenance and support contracts for our licensed software. In addition to licensing our software, we offer processing services (running on the CoreCard software platform). Processing customers pay an implementation and setup fee plus monthly service fees under a contract with a term of three or more years. Depending on factors such as contract terms, customer implementation and testing schedule, and extent of customization or configuration required and whether we are licensing or processing, the timing of revenue recognition on contracts may lead to considerable fluctuation in revenue and profitability. There are often delays in implementation cycles, especially for processing customers, due to third party approvals or processes that are outside of CoreCard’s control and thus it is not possible to predict with certainty when we will be able to begin recognizing revenue on new contracts. 
 
CoreCard’s licensed software products are used by its customers to manage and process various credit, debit and prepaid card programs and there are a number of federal and state regulations governing the issuance of and the processing of financial transactions associated with such cards. CoreCard’s customers are required to comply with such regulations and, to the extent that customers depend on their licensed CoreCard software to manage and process their card accounts, the CoreCard software features and functionality must allow customers to comply with the various governmental regulations. CoreCard continually evaluates applicable regulations and regularly upgrades and enhances its software to help its customers meet their obligations to comply with current and anticipated governmental regulations. As part of CoreCard’s processing business, CoreCard is responsible for providing compliance-related services, including data and network security, customer identification screening and regular reporting which enable its customers to be in compliance with all applicable governmental regulations including but not limited to the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering regulations. Depending on the extent of changes and new governmental regulations, CoreCard may from time to time incur additional costs to modify its software and services to be compliant. CoreCard has no costs related to compliance with environmental laws. 
 
We believe that uncertainty and turmoil in the financial services sector as well as the increased regulatory and compliance requirements have had a negative impact on buying decisions for potential customers in recent years. The situation has impacted and may continue to impact the willingness and ability of banks and network associations (such as MasterCard or Visa) to approve new customer programs which could impact demand for our product and service offerings. 
 
Our business is not seasonal.

Incubator Program
 
For more than twenty-five years, we have been associated with an incubator program (the Gwinnett Innovation Park) at our corporate facility in Norcross, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. In exchange for a monthly facility fee, incubator companies have access to office space, conference facilities, telecommunication and network infrastructure, business advice, and a network of peers. We view this program as a way to stay abreast of new business opportunities and trends which may benefit our company while simultaneously contributing to our local community in a positive way by supporting entrepreneurship and start-ups, with minimal financial outlay or management time.
Non-consolidated Companies
 
From time to time, we have invested in entrepreneurial companies that we believe are bringing new applications or technologies to business markets and may continue to do so. Typically, these companies are privately held, early stage companies in technology-related fields. From time to time, we may increase our investment in a company or write down the value of an investment if we believe it is impaired or there may be a liquidation event in which we participate. Typically the timing and amounts of such events are not predictable. Please refer to Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to a sale and a write-down of two of our non-consolidated companies. 
Research and Development
 
We spent $2.7 million and $2.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on company sponsored research and development. All of our consolidated research and development expense is related to our FinTech business. We maintain a workforce of approximately 260 employees in our offshore operations in India and Romania for software development and testing, as well as operations support for processing services. We continuously add new features and functionality to our financial technology software in response to market requirements and trends and expect to continue to do so. 
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets
 
We have one U.S. patent covering aspects of CoreCard’s core software platform. It may be possible for competitors to duplicate certain aspects of our products and processes even though we regard such aspects as proprietary. We have registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and several foreign jurisdictions various trademarks and service marks for our products. We believe that an active trade secret, trade name, trademark, and copyright protection program is one element in developing and maintaining brand recognition and protecting our intellectual property. We presently market our products under trademarks and service marks such as CoreCard®, CoreENGINE™, CoreISSUE™, CoreCOLLECT™, CoreMONEY™ and others. 
Personnel
 
As of February 15, 2017, we had 286 full-time equivalent employees (including our subsidiaries in the United States and foreign countries). Of these, 280 are involved in CoreCard’s software development, testing and operations, and 6 in corporate functions. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, we have not had any work stoppages or strikes and we believe our employee relations are good.
