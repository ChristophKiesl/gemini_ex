ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Except as expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company” and “GNOG” refer to Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc.
We are an online gaming, or iGaming, and digital sports entertainment company focused on providing its customers with the most enjoyable, realistic and exciting online gaming experience in the market. We currently operate in New Jersey, Michigan and West Virginia, where it offers patrons the ability to play their favorite casino games and bet on live-action sports events, and in Virginia, where it currently offers online sports betting only. Our desire to innovate, improve and offer the most realistic online gaming platform drives our employees and defines our business, as we pursue our vision to be the leading destination for online gaming players with a modern mindset.
We were one of the first online gaming operators to enter the New Jersey market in 2013 and Michigan market on January 22, 2021 and we recently entered the West Virginia market on September 22, 2021, and the Virginia market (offering online sports betting only) on September 29, 2021. As an affiliate of the Golden Nugget/Landry’s family of companies, which we refer to as “GNL,” we aspire to live up to the reputation of the Golden Nugget brand, a storied brand in the gaming industry, by providing customers with an online gaming experience consistent with the land-based casinos of Golden Nugget, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FEI (as defined below) (“Golden Nugget”). Our technology is designed to create superior online betting experiences for the avid casino and sports bettor. Our goals have been shaped with these players in mind, both in who he or she is today and who we anticipate he or she will become as the gaming industry evolves. The vision of the Golden Nugget brand underpins our position as a market leader and innovator in today’s rapidly expanding online gaming industry.
We believe that we are well-positioned for continued growth with the support of the Golden Nugget brand and its seasoned management team, together with our commitment to innovation. We believe that this enviable combination of expertise, brand recognition and infrastructure will not only support our continued success in the New Jersey, Michigan and West Virginia markets, but also allow us to capture market share in other key online gaming states in the future. We recently entered the Virginia (in respect of online sports betting only), West Virginia and Michigan markets, and are currently targeting Arizona, Pennsylvania and Illinois as states in which we plan to enter in the near future, subject to regulatory approvals, with Colorado, Iowa, and Louisiana expected to follow, subject to regulatory approvals.

Corporate History
Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc. (formerly known as Landcadia Holdings II, Inc. or “Landcadia II”) was originally incorporated as CAPS Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, on August 11, 2015, and converted into a Delaware corporation on February 4, 2019, for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. On May 9, 2019, Landcadia II consummated an initial public offering, after which its securities began trading on Nasdaq.
On December 29, 2020 we completed the acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming, LLC (formerly known as Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc.) (“GNOG LLC”), a New Jersey limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of GNOG Holdco (as defined below) (the “Acquisition Transaction”). The acquisition was completed pursuant to the purchase agreement, dated June 28, 2020 (as amended on September 17, 2020 and December 20, 2020, the “Purchase Agreement”) by and among the Company, LHGN HoldCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Landcadia Holdco”), Landry’s Fertitta, LLC, a Texas 

1



limited liability company (“LF LLC”), GNOG Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of LF LLC (“GNOG Holdco”), and GNOG LLC. Following the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, we changed our name from “Landcadia Holdings II, Inc.” to “Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc.”
GNOG LLC was incorporated in New Jersey in February 2011 under the name Landry’s A/C Gaming, Inc., which was subsequently changed to Landry’s Finance Acquisition Co. in November 2011 and ultimately Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc. on May 6, 2020. In December 2020 and in connection with the transaction, GNOG Inc. converted into a limited liability company by merging with and into GNOG LLC.
We operate as an umbrella partnership C-corporation, or “Up-C,” meaning that substantially all of our assets are held indirectly through GNOG LLC, our indirect subsidiary, and our business is conducted through GNOG LLC.
DraftKings Merger 
On August 9, 2021, the Company, DraftKings Inc., a Nevada corporation (“DraftKings”), New Duke Holdco, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of DraftKings (“New DraftKings”), Duke Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of New DraftKings (“Duke Merger Sub”), and Gulf Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of New DraftKings (“Gulf Merger Sub” and, together with Duke Merger Sub, the “Merger Subs”), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “DraftKings Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which New DraftKings will, among other things, acquire all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The transactions contemplated by the DraftKings Merger Agreement and the other related transactions are referred to herein as the “DraftKings Merger.”
On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (a) at the Duke Effective Time (as defined in the DraftKings Merger Agreement), Duke Merger Sub will be merged with and into DraftKings in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes (the “NRS”), with DraftKings becoming the surviving corporation (the “Duke Surviving Corporation”) and (b) at the Gulf Effective Time (as defined in the DraftKings Merger Agreement), Gulf Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), with the Company becoming the surviving corporation (the “Gulf Surviving Corporation”, and together with the Duke Surviving Corporation, collectively the “Surviving Corporations”). In connection with the DraftKings Merger, certain affiliates of Tilman Fertitta will consummate certain reorganization transactions to allow Landcadia Holdco to become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company following the consummation of the DraftKings Merger. 
The DraftKings Merger Agreement provides that upon the consummation of the DraftKings Merger, each holder of our common stock will receive 0.365 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a share of Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, of New DraftKings (the “New DraftKings Class A Common Stock”) for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Gulf Effective Time (other than certain excluded shares). 
Each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of DraftKings (“DraftKings Class A Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Duke Effective Time (other than certain excluded shares) will be cancelled, cease to exist and be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of New DraftKings Class A Common Stock and each share of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of DraftKings issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Duke Effective Time (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of New DraftKings.
At the Gulf Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit (a “RSU”) issued by us that (i) was outstanding on the date of the DraftKings Merger Agreement or (ii) is issued to our existing employees prior to the completion of the DraftKings Merger in accordance with existing agreements, will vest, be cancelled, and entitle the holder thereof to receive a number of shares of New DraftKings Class A Common Stock equal to the number of shares of our common stock subject to such RSU immediately prior to the Gulf Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, less a number of shares of New DraftKings Class A Common Stock equal to any applicable withholding taxes. All other issued and outstanding RSUs will be automatically converted into an equivalent restricted stock unit of New DraftKings that 

2



entitles the holder thereof to a number of shares of New DraftKings Class A Common Stock equal to the number of shares of our common stock subject to such RSU immediately prior to the Gulf Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and will remain outstanding in New DraftKings.
At the Gulf Effective Time, each outstanding warrant issued by us (“Private Placement Warrant”) to purchase shares of our Class A common stock will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder convert into a warrant to purchase a number of New DraftKings Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of our Class A common stock subject to such Private Placement Warrant immediately prior to the Gulf Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and the exercise price of such Private Placement Warrant will be determined by dividing (1) the per share exercise price of such Private Placement Warrant immediately prior to the Gulf Effective Time by (2) the Exchange Ratio. 
The DraftKings Merger is expected to be a tax-deferred transaction to our stockholders and warrant holders, and the closing of the DraftKings Merger is conditioned on the receipt of a tax opinion to such effect. 
The DraftKings Merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among others, (i) the absence of certain legal restraints that would prohibit or seek to prohibit DraftKings Merger; (ii) the receipt of certain regulatory approvals; (iii) the approval for listing on Nasdaq of the shares of New DraftKings Class A Common Stock to be issued to DraftKings stockholders and our stockholders; (iv) the Commercial Agreement (as defined in the DraftKings Merger Agreement) being in full force and effect; and (v) the absence, since the date of the DraftKings Merger Agreement, of any effect, event, development, change, state of facts, condition, circumstance or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or DraftKings.
Concurrently with the execution of the DraftKings Merger Agreement, DraftKings entered into a support and registration rights agreement (the “Support Agreement”) with New DraftKings, Tilman J. Fertitta (“Fertitta”), Fertitta Entertainment, Inc., a Texas corporation (“FEI”), LF LLC, Golden Landry’s LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Golden Landry’s”) and Golden Fertitta, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Golden Fertitta” and together with Fertitta, FEI, LF LLC and Golden Landry’s, the “Fertitta Parties”), pursuant to which the Fertitta Parties agreed (i) not to transfer the New DraftKings Class A Common Stock that the Fertitta Parties will receive in the DraftKings Merger prior to the first anniversary of the closing of the DraftKings Merger and (ii) from the date of the Support Agreement to the five-year anniversary of the closing of the DraftKings Merger, not to engage in a Competing Business (as defined in the Support Agreement). New DraftKings agreed to provide the Fertitta Parties with shelf registration rights with respect to New DraftKings Class A Common Stock and warrants to purchase New DraftKings Class A Common Stock that the Fertitta Parties will receive in connection with the DraftKings Merger. In addition, the Fertitta Parties have agreed to execute (and cause its affiliates to execute) all such agreements and take such action as required to waive the obligations of all Fertitta Parties to make interest payments on behalf of the Company and of the Company to issue equity in relation to such payments.
Concurrently with the execution of the DraftKings Merger Agreement, LF LLC entered into a contribution agreement, dated as of August 9, 2021 and amended as of November 15, 2021 with New DraftKings whereby LF LLC agreed to contribute to New DraftKings all of LF LLC’s interests in Landcadia Holdco in exchange for shares of New DraftKings Class A common stock upon the closing of the DraftKings Merger. New DraftKings entered into the GNOG Contribution Agreement with us whereby New DraftKings agreed to contribute the aforementioned interests in Landcadia Holdco to us in exchange for shares of our common stock.
Industry Background/Market Opportunity
We are focused on becoming a leader in U.S. iGaming, which is a fast-growing part of the larger U.S. gaming industry. iGaming includes all online casino games played on a computer or mobile device such as slots, video poker, electronic table games and live dealer table games, but does not include online sports betting. The iGaming market includes both “Pure Casino” players who sign up for the primary purpose of playing online casino games, such as slots or table games, as well as sports betting players who also want to play casino games.

During March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, which we refer to as “COVID-19.” The current COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst to accelerate growth in the U.S. iGaming industry as many people are spending more time at home. The pandemic has changed the way people work and live, with increased use and dependence on technology and a need for at-home entertainment options. The number of people engaging in iGaming has increased significantly as a result of these changes, some of which are currently expected to continue for an indefinite period of time or may become permanent. According to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (the “DGE”), the iGaming market in New Jersey has grown significantly, from approximately $221 million in total iGaming revenues in 2017 to approximately $462 million in 2019, and to approximately $931.5 million in 2020, representing a 101.7% increase over the same period in 2019. Total iGaming revenues in New Jersey for 2021 were $1,337 million.
We have operated real money online gaming within the State of New Jersey since 2013, in the State of Michigan since 2021 and West Virginia since September 2021. We are also contracted to manage certain third parties that are also authorized to operate real money online gaming in New Jersey, for which we receive royalties and cost reimbursement. As of the date of this Annual Report, iGaming is legal in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Michigan, West Virginia, Connecticut, and Nevada, and online sports betting is legal in twenty-one states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In addition, legislation to legalize iGaming and/or sports betting is pending in several states. We anticipate that legalization of iGaming and online sports betting will expand across the U.S. as states understand and appreciate the revenue potential.
Over the last few years, iGaming revenue as a percentage of land-based gaming revenue has grown. For example, based on data released by the DGE, between 2016 and 2019, iGaming revenue grew from 7.0% to 17.0% of land-based gaming revenue in New Jersey. For 2020, iGaming revenue in New Jersey represented 62.0% of land-based gaming revenue, according to data published by the DGE. On March 16, 2020, all Atlantic City land-based casinos were required to close because of the governmental response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, February and March 2020, iGaming revenues represented 27.7%, 23.0% and 75.8% of Atlantic City land-based casino gaming revenues, respectively. During April, May and June 2020, Atlantic City land-based casino gaming generated no revenue. Atlantic City casinos reopened on July 2, 2020, resulting in the percentage of iGaming revenues compared to Atlantic City land-based casino gaming revenues decreasing to 65.6% for the month of December 2020. The increase in iGaming revenues in 2020 is attributable, in part, to the temporary closure of Atlantic City casinos, leading traditional casino players to utilize online gaming. Nonetheless, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth trend in iGaming. Our management estimates that, on a run-rate basis, the iGaming market in the U.S. long-term will achieve 30.0% penetration versus the land-based market. For 2021, iGaming revenue was 54.0% of land-based gaming in New Jersey.

Strength of the Golden Nugget Brand
One of the unique features that have contributed to our success is our affiliation with GNL and Mr. Fertitta, GNL’s chairman and chief executive officer and our chief executive officer and chairman of our Board. GNL is a household name in the U.S., with a diversified restaurant, hospitality, entertainment and gaming portfolio. The Golden Nugget name is a well-known and storied brand in the gaming industry. Celebrated since opening as a gambling hall in Las Vegas in 1946, Golden Nugget is associated with gaming and high-quality service at an attractive value. Golden Nugget maintains a geographically diverse portfolio of five land-based casinos: Golden Nugget Las Vegas, Nevada; Golden Nugget Laughlin, Nevada; Golden Nugget Lake Charles, Louisiana; Golden Nugget Biloxi, Mississippi; and Golden Nugget Atlantic City, New Jersey. The Golden Nugget casino properties offer popular slot machines and table games as well as a wide selection of amenities.
As the online gaming affiliate of Golden Nugget Atlantic City, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company, which we refer to as “GNAC,” we have taken the best aspects of its legacy brand and modified them to attract today’s online gaming customer.
Mr. Fertitta is an internationally recognized businessman with a significant media presence throughout the U.S. According to CNBC, Mr. Fertitta’s TV show, “Billion Dollar Buyer,” was the network’s “most watched premiere hour ever” in 2016 and has aired three successful seasons. In addition, he is a New York Times Best-Selling author with his book “Shut Up and Listen,” which outlines his business philosophies. In addition to GNL, Mr. Fertitta is the sole owner of the NBA’s Houston Rockets. Our brand has been significantly enhanced through Mr. Fertitta’s promotion and support of our company.
iGaming Focus Targeting High Value Customers
As one of the only true iGaming-focused online gaming companies, we believe we are well positioned to continue to acquire the highest value customers in the iGaming market. While we offer both iGaming and online sports betting, our management believes the combination of higher lifetime player value (“LTV”) and player demographics of iGaming players creates a superior value proposition for iGaming. As a result, we intend to focus our efforts on acquiring high value iGaming players. Nevertheless, we believe offering online sports betting increases our competitive advantage because many online sports betting players also choose to play casino games.
A key to our success is our superior ability to acquire and retain the highest value iGaming players, resulting in higher engagement as measured by LTV. We believe that the average iGaming player plays longer, reinvests his or her winnings more quickly and has a higher disposable income, all of which contributes to a higher total engagement per active month than land-based casino players and online sports bettors.
Player demographics for our iGaming players are relatively split between gender, with around 55% of customers being male and 45% being female. In contrast, approximately 95% of our online sports bettors are male. Similarly, our average iGaming player is between 40 and 45 years old, whereas our online sports player tends to be between 30 and 35 years old.
Profitable Customer Acquisition
Another component of our success is our ability to attract new high value customers through GNL’s customer database. Landry’s Select Club, a restaurant loyalty program implemented in 2009 by GNL, had over 3 million members as of December 31, 2021, and prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, was adding more than 5,500 members per week. Approximately 18% of GNL’s restaurant sales are associated with Landry’s Select Club transactions. The Golden Nugget 24k Select Club, a loyalty program for Golden Nugget casino customers, had 4.9 million members as of December 31, 2021, and prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, was adding over 7,000 new members per week on average since July of 2019. Management believes that access to this database is an advantage in promoting our products to new customers and will accelerate our growth into new jurisdictions as the legalization of online gaming spreads across the U.S.

In addition to using the GNL databases, we target our marketing efforts through high-quality traffic sources including TV advertising, targeted digital spend, and extensive relationships with leading affiliates in the U.S. market to increase our customer base. As is typical in high-growth industries, we believe most companies in the online gaming vertical to date have allocated a disproportionate amount of their capital to marketing and advertising to build a customer database in the hopes of capturing market share. In contrast, we have been able to keep customer acquisition costs relatively low as a percentage of our revenue while achieving significant growth. We estimate that new players typically reach a break-even return on investment, or ROI, by month five, earn the company an approximately 2.2x ROI by year one, and an approximately 8.0x ROI by year five, in each case where ROI is calculated as cumulative gross gaming revenue (“GGR”) divided by advertising spend.
Market-Leading Innovation and Content
We offer customers a superior platform for iGaming with what we believe to be a best-in-class iGaming content mix, combined with continued innovation and new product offerings. As of December 31, 2021, we offered over 900 game titles in New Jersey, which we believe gives us a significant lead in the New Jersey market in terms of total available content. We believe that our ability to offer a wider array of iGaming products effectively reduces our customer acquisition costs and player churn by providing a superior product offering as compared to our competitors.
We believe that our commitment to innovation is demonstrated by consistently being first-to-market with the latest iGaming offerings:

● | Live Dealer Studio. We were the first company to launch a Live Dealer studio in the United States. The Live Dealer studio provides a more realistic environment for customers through interactions with a live dealer and fellow players, which our management believes has been a significant factor in convincing casino players to use iGaming. Because of the success of the Live Dealer studio, we have 18 tables in our Live Dealer studio as of December 31, 2021, increased from four tables when we first offered this product in 2016. The Live Dealer studio is currently undergoing an expansion to 33 tables.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Golden Nugget-Branded Video Slot Games. We believe that we were also the first to offer a branded video slot game online, the “Golden Nugget Video Slot,” which gives players the experience of being in one of Golden Nugget’s land-based casinos.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New Games. We have been successful in introducing new game categories to its customers, such as Steppers and Megaways.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are well-positioned to maintain our status as an online gaming innovator through our strategic partnerships with the top gaming equipment suppliers in the industry, including Scientific Games Digital (“SGD”). We have a multi-year, multi-state, multi-product, multi-channel agreement with SGD for iGaming and sports betting, whereby SGD provides us with its core platform (Player Account Management, Wallet, Bonusing Tools), online casino platform (Open Gaming System), and online games, and has agreed to provide us with its online sports betting platform and sports managed trading services through June 30, 2024 in New Jersey, and will provide such platforms and services in the future for terms of generally three or four years following specified milestone events such as the initial deployment of our software in a state or of any additional vertical in Nevada, Mississippi and Pennsylvania. This and other partnerships have enabled us to launch 20 exclusive games in 2020 and 55 more games in 2021.
Support from GNL
We receive significant support from GNL through several contractual arrangements described below. We believe our relationship with GNL is highly constructive and will enable us to be successful in the long-term. Set forth below is a summary of the terms of these contractual arrangements.

6



Trademark License Agreement 
In connection with the Acquisition Transaction, GNOG LLC entered into a trademark license agreement (the “Trademark License Agreement”) with Golden Nugget and GNLV, pursuant to which GNLV has granted GNOG LLC an exclusive license to use certain “Golden Nugget” trademarks (and other trademarks related to our business) in connection with operating online real money casino gambling and sports wagering in the U.S. and any of its territories, subject to certain restrictions. The license has a twenty-year term that commenced on the closing date of the Acquisition Transaction. During the term of the agreement, we have agreed to pay Golden Nugget a monthly royalty payment equal to 3% of Net Gaming Revenue (as defined therein). Upon the tenth and fifteenth anniversary of the effective date of the Trademark License Agreement, the monthly royalty amount payable to GNLV will be adjusted to equal the greater of (i) 3% of Net Gaming Revenue and (ii) the fair market value of the licenses (as determined by an independent appraiser, if necessary).
While the trademarks licensed under the Trademark License Agreement generally will be exclusively licensed to us, in the event that (i) a new market or opportunity becomes available (e.g., pursuant to the legalization of online gaming in another jurisdiction), and (ii) we are unwilling, unable or otherwise fail to pursue such market or opportunity, Golden Nugget will be permitted to pursue such market or opportunity and utilize the trademarks covered by the Trademark License Agreement with respect thereto (such provision, the “Exclusive Area Adjustment”). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Trademark License Agreement will restrict us (or Golden Nugget) from owning or operating an online-based casino using marks that are not covered by the Trademark License Agreement. 
In connection with the DraftKings Merger, GNOG LLC, Golden Nugget and GNLV agreed to amend the Trademark License Agreement pursuant to terms agreed to in the DraftKings Merger Agreement, including, among other things, to (i) extend the term of the Trademark License Agreement from twenty years to fifty years from the closing of the DraftKings Merger and (ii) eliminate the Exclusive Area Adjustment described above.
A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement
Pursuant to an amended and restated online gaming operations agreement (the “A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement”), GNAC granted GNOG LLC the right to host, manage, control, operate, support and administer, under GNAC’s land-based casino operating licenses, the “Golden Nugget”-branded online gaming business, the live dealer studio in New Jersey and the third-party operators. Under the A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement, GNOG LLC is responsible for managing, administering and operating its online gaming business and providing services to GNAC in connection with the management and administration of certain platform agreements and GNAC is required to provide certain operational and infrastructure services to GNOG LLC in connection with its New Jersey operations. In addition to the royalty payable pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, under the A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement GNOG LLC is also obligated to reimburse GNAC for certain expenses incurred by GNAC in connection with the New Jersey online gaming business, such as New Jersey licensing costs, regulatory fees, certain gaming taxes and other expenses incurred by GNAC directly in connection with GNOG LLC’s operations in New Jersey. The A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement has a term of five years commencing from April 2020 and is renewable by GNOG LLC for an additional five-year term. The A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement also provides for, among other things, (a) minimum performance standards under which GNOG LLC is required to operate the “Golden Nugget”-branded online gaming business, and (b) an arm’s length risk allocation framework (including with respect to insurance and indemnification obligations). 
The A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement, as modified by the Commercial Agreement (as defined in the DraftKings Merger Agreement) and certain other changes thereto agreed upon by GNAC and GNOG LLC, is expected to remain in effect following the completion of the DraftKings Merger.
Lease Agreements
GNOG LLC leases a portion of the space within the Golden Nugget Atlantic City Hotel & Casino located at 600 Huron Ave, Atlantic City, NJ 08401 from GNAC for the operation of an online live casino table gaming studio from which live broadcasted casino games are offered to online gaming customers. The lease has a five-year term from April 

7



27, 2020, plus one five-year renewal period. This lease is expected to remain in effect following the completion of the DraftKings Merger.
In connection with the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, GNOG LLC entered into office leases with Golden Nugget Atlantic City, LLC and Golden Nugget, LLC, respectively, or their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Office Leases”). The Office Leases provide for annual rent payments of $88,128 for the office space leased in Houston, Texas and $24,252 for the office space leased in Atlantic City, New Jersey, subject to an increase of 10% for any renewal term and market rent increases in the event that GNOG LLC requires the use of additional office space during the term thereof. However, any amounts actually paid by GNOG LLC under the Trademark License Agreement and the A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement will be credited against GNOG LLC’s rent obligations under the Office Leases. Each Office Lease will have a term of five years. In connection with any renewal of the term of the A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement, GNOG LLC has an option to renew each Office Lease for the lesser of (i) five years or (ii) the length of the renewed term of the A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement. Each Office Lease may be terminated by GNOG LLC or the respective landlord upon six months’ notice. These office leases are expected to remain in effect following the completion of the DraftKings Merger.
Services Agreement
In connection with the Acquisition Transaction, GNOG LLC entered into the services agreement with Golden Nugget to provide for the performance of certain services (the “Services Agreement”). Pursuant to the Services Agreement, GNAC and Golden Nugget have agreed to provide certain services and facilities, including payroll, accounting, financial planning and other agreed upon services, to GNOG LLC from time to time and GNOG LLC has agreed to provide continued management, consulting and administrative services to Golden Nugget’s applicable subsidiary in connection with retail sports betting conducted in such subsidiary’s brick-and-mortar casino. Under the Services Agreement, each party is responsible for its own expenses and the employer of any shared employee is responsible for such shared employee’s total compensation. We are also obligated to reimburse the party providing the service or facilities at cost. 
The Services Agreement is expected to be terminated in connection with the completion of the DraftKings Merger. However, certain services are expected to continue on a transitional basis pursuant to a transition services agreement to be entered into in connection with the completion of the DraftKings Merger.
Agreement with Danville Development
On November 18, 2020, GNOG LLC entered into a definitive agreement with Danville Development, LLC (the “Danville Development”) for market access to the State of Illinois. Danville Development is a joint venture between Wilmot Gaming Illinois, LLC and GN Danville, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden Nugget and an affiliate of GNOG LLC, formed to build a new “Golden Nugget”-branded casino in Danville, Illinois, pending obtaining all regulatory approvals. GN Danville, LLC will own a 25% equity interest in Danville Development and has an option to purchase the other equity interests in the future at a price to be determined pursuant to the definitive agreement. The definitive agreement has a term of 20 years and requires GNOG LLC to pay Danville Development a percentage of its online net gaming revenue, subject to minimum royalty payments over the term. In addition, under the definitive agreement, GNOG LLC holds the exclusive right to offer online sports betting and, if permitted by law in the future, online casino wagering. GNOG LLC has committed to a mezzanine loan to be provided in the amount of $30.0 million to Danville Development, which will indirectly benefit GN Danville, LLC, for the development and construction of the casino. 
The foregoing agreements were entered into between related parties and were not the result of arm’s-length negotiations. Accordingly, the terms of the transactions may have been more or less favorable than might have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.
Seasoned Management Team of Industry Experts
We are led by a seasoned management team of industry experts that enable the company to continue to achieve success in the online gaming space. Tilman Fertitta, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has established himself 

8



as one of the preeminent businessmen in the United States regardless of industry focus. Mr. Fertitta has an extensive track record in the consumer, hospitality and gaming sectors with over 30 years of experience. Thomas Winter, our President, is a gaming industry veteran and has served as Senior Vice-President and General Manager of the online gaming division of Landry’s LLC for seven years. Prior to Landry’s LLC, Mr. Winter served as Chief Executive Officer of Betclic, a major European online sports betting and gaming operator, which merged with Expekt.com.
Best-In-Class Customer Support

Short-Term Growth Plan and Opportunities
We commenced iGaming and online sports betting operations in Michigan in January 2021 and West Virginia in September 2021, and we commenced online sports betting operations in Virginia in September 2021.
Michigan
We began offering iGaming and online sports betting in Michigan in January 2021 through an arrangement with a licensed tribal casino. According to the Michigan Lawful Internet Gaming Act, as of December 31, 2021, Michigan has authorized up to 15 licenses for iGaming (three commercial land-based casinos and 12 tribes), and the applicable Michigan law allows for only one iGaming operating brand per licensee.

On June 17, 2020, GNOG LLC entered into a market access agreement with Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, a federally recognized Indian Tribe, which we refer to as “KBIC”, pursuant to which KBIC agreed to grant it the right to operate a “Golden Nugget”-branded online casino (including, at its discretion, online poker) and online sportsbook in the State of Michigan under KBIC’s casino license held in connection with KBIC’s ownership of the Ojibwa Casinos located in Baraga, Michigan and Marquette, Michigan. The initial term of the agreement with KBIC is 15 years with an optional 10-year renewal period.
West Virginia
We launched iGaming and online sports betting operations in West Virginia in September 2021. Online sports betting was legalized in West Virginia in March 2018 and iGaming was legalized in March 2019. According to the West Virginia Lottery Interactive Wagering Act and the West Virginia Lottery Sports Wagering Act, as of December 31, 2021, West Virginia has authorized up to five statewide licenses for online sports betting and iGaming each, and the applicable West Virginia laws allow for three brands per licensee.
On November 20, 2020, GNOG LLC entered into a market access agreement with Greenbrier Hotel Corporation, which gives us the right to offer online sports betting and iGaming in West Virginia. The term of the agreement with Greenbrier Hotel Corporation is for 10 years and allows GNOG LLC to use the “Golden Nugget” brand. As part of such agreement, GNOG LLC pays a percentage of its online net gaming revenue, subject to making minimum royalty payments to Greenbrier Hotel Corporation over the term.
Virginia
We launched online sports betting operations in Virginia in September 2021 and will pursue iGaming in Virginia, if and when legalized. For its operations in Virginia, LHGN Holdco has partnered with the Virginia Sports Technology Group, LLC, who have retained an equity interest in Golden Nugget Online Gaming VA, LLC, to operate online sports betting in Virginia. Golden Nugget Online VA, LLC, was granted an untethered temporary sports betting permit by the Virginia Lottery. Sports betting in Virginia was legalized in April 2020, initially authorizing a minimum of four untethered sports betting licenses and a maximum of 12 under a single brand, not including professional sports teams who may also be eligible; the same bill also authorized five new retail casinos, each of which will be able to authorize a skin.
Intellectual Property
We do not currently own any registered intellectual property. Our intellectual property portfolio consists substantially of licensed intellectual property, including the “Golden Nugget” trademarks licensed pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement with Golden Nugget and GNLV, each of which is our affiliates.
Pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, GNLV granted GNOG LLC an exclusive license to use certain “Golden Nugget” trademarks (and other trademarks related to its business) and domain names, including goldennuggetcasino.com, solely in connection with online real money casino gambling and sports wagering in the U.S. and any of its territories.
In addition to the intellectual property licensed by GNOG LLC under the Trademark License Agreement, we license certain third-party intellectual property (such as our platform and/or games) under licenses and service agreements with those third parties to operate our online real money casino gambling and sports wagering business, including through agreements with gaming content creators and service providers. Although we believe the licenses under the Trademark License Agreement and these third-party agreements are sufficient for the operation of our business, these licenses limit the use of the licensed intellectual property in specific manners and for specific time periods and we rely entirely on such rights granted by third parties or affiliates to operate our business. We may also rely in part on the counterparties to the Trademark License Agreement and such other third-party agreements to appropriately register, protect and defend the licensed intellectual property.

Companies in the gaming, sports betting, casino, technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may face allegations by third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights. As our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that affect our ability to operate in the iGaming and sports betting industries. These industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulations that could change based on political and social norms and that could be interpreted in ways that could negatively impact our business.
The gaming industry, which includes iGaming and sports betting, is heavily regulated and in order to continue our operations, we must maintain licenses and pay gaming taxes or a percentage of revenue in each jurisdiction from which we operate. Our business is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions from which we operate. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with material financial interests in gaming operations, along with the integrity and security of our iGaming and sports betting offerings. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions.
Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local tax revenues, as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish stringent procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and responsibility. Among other things, gaming laws require gaming industry participants to:

● | ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establish and maintain anti-money laundering practices and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain systems for reliable record keeping;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | file periodic reports with gaming regulators;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | establish programs to promote responsible gaming; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | enforce minimum age requirements.
--+----------------------------------

Typically, a state regulatory environment is established by statute and underlying regulations and is administered by one or more regulatory agencies (typically a gaming commission or state lottery) who regulate the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct or intend to conduct our business:

● | adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

11




● | interpret and enforce gaming laws and regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | impose fines and penalties for violations;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | review the character and fitness of participants in gaming operations and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | grant licenses for participation in gaming operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in gaming operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review and approve certain transactions, which may include acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of gaming industry participants and securities offerings and debt transactions in which such participants engage; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establish and collect fees and taxes in jurisdictions where applicable.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable iGaming and sports betting laws, licenses and regulatory requirements, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our users will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement investigation, proceeding or other governmental action or that any such proceeding or action, as the case may be, would not have a material adverse impact on us or our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
In order to operate in certain jurisdictions, we must obtain either a temporary or permanent license or determination of suitability from the responsible authorities. We seek to ensure that we obtain all necessary licenses to develop and put forth our offerings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and where our users are located.
Gaming laws require us, and often each of our holding and intermediary companies as well as subsidiaries, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our shareholders, to obtain licenses from, or found suitable by, gaming authorities. Licenses and suitability findings require a determination that the applicant is qualified. Where not mandated by statute, rule or regulation, gaming authorities typically have broad discretion in determining who must apply for a license or finding of suitability and whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable to conduct operations within a given jurisdiction. When determining to grant a license to an applicant, gaming authorities generally consider: (i) the financial stability, integrity, responsibility and suitability of the applicant and its applicable affiliated entities and individuals (including verification of the applicant’s sources of funding); (ii) the quality and security of the applicant’s online real-money gaming platform, hardware and related software, including the platform’s ability to operate in compliance with local regulation, as applicable; (iii) the applicant’s history; (iv) the applicant’s ability to operate its gaming business in a socially responsible manner; and (v) in certain circumstances, the effect on competition.
Gaming authorities may, subject to certain administrative procedural requirements, (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, revoke or suspend any license issued, or suitability finding made, by them; (ii) impose fines, either on a mandatory basis or as a consensual settlement of regulatory action; (iii) demand that named individuals or shareholders be disassociated from a gaming business; and (iv) in serious cases, liaise with local prosecutors to pursue legal action, which may result in civil or criminal penalties.
Events that may trigger revocation of a gaming license or another form of sanction vary by jurisdiction. However, typical events include, among others: (i) conviction in any jurisdiction of certain persons with an interest in, or key personnel of, the licensee of an offense that is punishable by imprisonment or may otherwise cast doubt on such person’s integrity; (ii) failure to comply with any material term or condition of the gaming license; (iii) declaration of, or otherwise engaging in, certain bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or discontinuance activities, or an order or 

12



application with respect to the same; (iv) obtaining the gaming license by a materially false or misleading representation or in some other improper way; (v) violation of applicable anti-money laundering or terrorist financing laws or regulations; (vi) failure to meet commitments to users, including social responsibility commitments; (vii) failure to pay in a timely manner all gaming or betting taxes or fees due; or (viii) determination by the gaming authority that there is another material and sufficient reason to revoke or impose another form of sanction upon the licensee.
As noted above, in addition to us and our direct and indirect holding companies and subsidiaries, gaming authorities generally also have the right to investigate individuals or entities having a material relationship to, or material involvement with, us or any of our affiliates, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable as a business associate. Specifically, as part of our obtaining iGaming and sportsbook licenses, certain of our officers, directors, and employees and in some cases, certain of our shareholders (typically, beneficial owners of more than 5% of a company’s outstanding equity, with most jurisdictions providing that “institutional investors” (as defined by a particular jurisdiction) can seek a waiver of these requirements) must file applications with the gaming authorities and may be required to be licensed or to qualify or be found suitable in many jurisdictions. Qualification and suitability determinations generally require the submission of extensive and detailed personal and financial disclosures followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes with respect to the individuals who occupy licensed positions must be reported to gaming authorities and in addition to the authority to deny an application for licensure, qualification, or a finding of suitability, gaming authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position. If any director, officer, employee or significant shareholder is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit required documentation) by a gaming authority, we may deem it necessary, or be required, to sever our relationship with such person. Furthermore, the charter provides that any of our capital stock owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates is transferred to the Company or one or more third-party transferees, as and to the extent required by a gaming authority or deemed necessary or advisable by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion.
Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after being advised that it is required by gaming authorities may be denied a license or found unsuitable, as applicable. Furthermore, we may be subject to disciplinary action or our licenses may be in peril if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we: (i) pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; (ii) allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; (iii) pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or (iv) fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his voting securities.
iGaming
We previously operated our iGaming platform in New Jersey pursuant to a transactional waiver order issued by the DGE. We previously applied to the Casino Control Commission for the issuance of a casino license as an “internet gaming affiliate” of GNAC and for qualification of our company as a holding company of casino licensee GNOG LLC. We also sought qualification as a financial source of GNAC in connection with our business. On November 25, 2020, regulatory approvals were received in New Jersey for the issuance of a casino license to GNOG LLC as an internet gaming affiliate of GNAC; our company to act as a holding company of casino licensee GNOG LLC; and, GNOG LLC to qualify as a financial source of GNAC. GNOG LLC has also entered into an agreement with a tribal casino in Michigan, which allows us to conduct our iGaming operations under the tribe’s license pursuant to a revenue share arrangement. We have also recently executed similar agreements in Illinois and West Virginia. On November 20, 2020, GNOG LLC entered into a market access agreement with Greenbrier Hotel Corporation, which gave us the right to offer online sports betting and iGaming in West Virginia. We subsequently launched iGaming and online sports betting operations in West Virginia in September 2021. Generally, online gambling in the United States is only lawful when specifically permitted under applicable state law (e.g., Ohio, Iowa, Colorado, New York and Arizona). At the federal level, several laws provide federal law enforcement with the authority to enforce and prosecute gambling operations conducted in violation of underlying state gambling laws. These enforcement laws include the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, which we refer to as the “UIGEA,” the Illegal Gambling Business Act and the Travel Act. No violation of the UIGEA, the Illegal Gambling Business Act or the Travel Act can be found absent a violation of an underlying state law or other federal law. The Wire Act provides that anyone engaged in the business of betting or

wagering who knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, will be fined or imprisoned, or both. However, the Wire Act notes that it shall not be construed to prevent the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests, or for the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest from a state or foreign country where betting on that sporting event or contest is legal into a state or foreign country in which such betting is legal. In 2018, the DOJ reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the Wire Act. The DOJ’s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that the DOJ’s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and vacated the DOJ’s new opinion. The DOJ had appealed the decision of the district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which reaffirmed the district court’s decision on January 20, 2021.
Sportsbook
We previously operated our online sports betting platform in New Jersey pursuant to the transactional waiver order referenced above. On November 25, 2020, we obtained regulatory approval in New Jersey for the issuance of a casino license to us as an “internet gaming affiliate” of GNAC. GNOG LLC’s agreements with a tribal casino in Michigan and with Greenbrier Hotel Corporation in West Virginia allow us to conduct online sports betting operations in those states. In Virginia, we were granted an untethered temporary sports betting permit by the Virginia Lottery, and we have partnered with the Virginia Sports Technology Group, LLC, which has retained an equity interest in Golden Nugget Online Gaming VA, LLC, to operate online sports betting in Virginia. GNOG LLC’s market access agreement in Illinois will also allow us to conduct future online sports betting operations in that state. On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion determining that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, which we refer to as “PASPA”, was unconstitutional. PASPA prohibited a state from “authorizing by law” any form of sports betting. In striking down PASPA, the Supreme Court opened the potential for state-by-state authorization of sports betting. Several states and territories, including Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming already have laws authorizing and regulating some form of sports betting online or in brick- and-mortar establishments. Sports betting in the United States is subject to additional laws, rules and regulations at the state level.
Data Protection and Privacy
Because we handle, collect, store, receive, transmit and otherwise process certain personal information of our users and employees, we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws related to the privacy and protection of such data. The regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.
Competition
Given that the U.S. online gaming market is vast and rapidly expanding, we believe any company competing for the time and disposable income of customers within such market to be a competitor. Currently there are several online gaming companies in the U.S. that provide iGaming, online sports betting, or both, including, but not limited to, DraftKings, FanDuel, Betfair, Caesars Entertainment, BetMGM, Roar Digital, Penn National Gaming and Rush Street Interactive. We currently compete with FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesars Entertainment, Roar Digital, Rush Street Interactive and Hard Rock, among others, in New Jersey and expect to compete with Rush Street Interactive, FanDuel, DraftKings, PokerStars, Kindred and Penn National Gaming, among others, in Pennsylvania and FanDuel, DraftKings, Roar Digital, Penn National Gaming and Rush Street Interactive, among others, in Michigan when it begins operations in those states. Additionally, we expect competition from new entrants over time.

14



We believe the principal competitive factors in the business include reliability, gaming offerings, the ability to acquire and retain users, regulatory compliance, market access, brand equity, customer service and innovation.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 259 employees. We also occasionally rely on independent contractors to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or are a party to any collective bargaining arrangement.
Responsible Gaming
We are committed to the welfare of our users and as such have made available to them the industry-leading tools, systems, resources and processes they need to play responsibly.
