Overview 
Sumo Logic empowers organizations to close the intelligence gap.
Sumo Logic is the pioneer of Continuous Intelligence, a new category of software, which enables organizations of all sizes to address the challenges and opportunities presented by digital transformation, modern applications, and cloud computing. Our Continuous Intelligence Platform enables organizations to automate the collection, ingestion, and analysis of application, infrastructure, security, and IoT data to derive actionable insights within seconds. Continuous intelligence leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, and is provided as a multi-tenant cloud service that allows organizations to more rapidly deliver reliable applications and digital services, protect against modern security threats, and consistently optimize their business processes in real time. This empowers employees across all lines of business, development, IT, and security teams with the data and insights needed to address the technology and collaboration challenges required for modern business. With our Continuous Intelligence Platform, executives and employees have the intelligence they require to take prescriptive action in real time—a modern business imperative.
We live in the intelligence economy. Organizations can succeed or fail based on how well they understand and respond to what is happening inside their business. Reports, surveys, or monitoring alerts provided by traditional operational and security technologies and manual processes are no longer effective. Today, businesses generate data from multiple sources–every touchpoint, customer interaction, and digital connection across an entire business and ecosystem. This represents an unprecedented volume of data that is growing at an extraordinary pace which is, at best, difficult to digest and, at worst, an impediment to driving the speed of decision-making needed to compete in today’s dynamic marketplaces.
Businesses thriving in the intelligence economy are taking a completely different approach to solving the intelligence gap, by seeking out solutions that provide real-time continuous intelligence that improves how they collectively and collaboratively build, manage, and secure their digital services. Organizations that will be successful in the digital age must be able to utilize their most important resource: their data.
Our vision is to democratize machine data, making insights from this rich source available to all. Our Continuous Intelligence Platform gives our customers insights across a wide range of use cases. We help our customers: monitor and troubleshoot their applications and their cloud and on-premise infrastructure; manage audit and compliance requirements; rapidly detect and resolve modern security threats; and extract critical key performance indicators, or KPIs, from various types of machine data to gain visibility into customer behavior, engagement, and actions. We enable our customers to derive critical value from their data with advanced analytics based on our proprietary machine learning technology that identifies and predicts anomalies in real time.
Our multi-tenant, cloud-native platform was architected by big data and security experts and has been in operation continuously for nearly a decade. Our platform is built on a modern, microservices-based application and cloud architecture, leverages security-first principles, and incorporates AI/ML algorithms to deliver real-time actionable insights. We started in 2010 with the mission to provide organizations with the ability to ingest and analyze complex unstructured machine data, such as logs, events and security data for a cloud SIEM solution. However, we always had the vision to expand our data analytics capabilities to address less complex structured machine data, such as time-series metrics from applications and infrastructure, to provide a cloud-native operational intelligence solution. Our platform integrates and analyzes structured, semi-structured, and unstructured machine data, both historically and in real time, to provide actionable intelligence around what happened, why it happened, and how to resolve business, technology, or cybersecurity issues.
We deliberately architected and built our analytics platform to address the technology challenges and gaps in intelligence that arise from siloed development, operations, and security teams in order to enable organizations to adopt a more modern DevSecOps operating model. DevSecOps is the philosophy of integrating security practices within the DevOps process, and involves ongoing, flexible collaboration among developers, release engineers, and security teams. DevOps is a combination of practices that automates the processes between software development and operations teams in order to build, test, and deploy modern applications faster. Ultimately, it enables teams to gain more insights and intelligence in order to release software faster, optimize processes, and better deliver digital solutions to customers. We offer a suite of solutions to address the intelligence gap: Operational Intelligence, Security Intelligence, Business Intelligence, and Global Intelligence.
We address both cloud-native businesses, as well as traditional on-premise businesses that are seeking to build, manage, and secure modern applications as they undertake their digital transformation and cloud adoption initiatives. We serve organizations of all sizes, from large enterprises to small and mid-market businesses, regardless of their cloud, digital transformation, security analytics, or DevSecOps maturity.
Industry Background
Nearly every business must transform into a digital business or be disrupted. Customers now expect real-time, instantaneous, always-on experiences. To meet these expectations, successful businesses need to continuously deliver updated information and improved services to their end customers, such as promotional offerings, pricing information, inventory levels, and service availability. Every business must continuously innovate.
Executives are accountable for the overall operational and financial health of the business and can no longer hide behind a gap in intelligence. This is especially true for security, as organizations must protect against breaches and reputational costs as they digitize. This accountability is not only the responsibility of executives. Employees across the organization are now expected to find ways to improve intelligence by integrating silos that exist across systems, applications, services, and processes.
Today, every company is becoming a software company by delivering more business services through modern applications, automating workflows, and leveraging data from digital signals to satisfy increasing customer expectations. To enable differentiated digital services, organizations must take a new approach to software architectures, tools, and development processes that span multiple public cloud providers while simultaneously securing their digital assets. 
We believe all businesses require the following five pillars to be successful in the intelligence economy.
Modern application architectures
•Microservices and containers make it easier to release software faster, create greater agility, and better user experience.
•New architectures increase complexity, introduce more systems to manage, and create more signals to capture and analyze.
Multi-cloud adoption 
•Running distributed workloads in the cloud provides scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.
•Multi-cloud environments create digital sprawl and challenges in managing and securing multi-cloud environments concurrently.
Continuous security 
•Building security into the fabric of every digital organization can guard against the threat against reputational damage, negative customer impact, and financial loss.
•The perimeter-less digital world has created even more pressure and accountability for the modern security operations center, or SOC, which suffers from a lack of skilled analysts and cloud-native technologies.
Continuous collaboration 
•Real-time, consistent information allows individuals across DevSecOps teams and line of business users to communicate and collaborate in the agile digital world.
•Organizations struggle to get a unified view of what is happening in their organizations when they are forced to use antiquated, siloed systems that only present a partial view of data and lack real-time context around what is happening broadly.
Data-driven intelligence 
•Massive amounts of data from every touchpoint, customer interaction, and digital connection provide differentiation to companies that can harness its insights.
•Today’s businesses are overwhelmed with information they cannot digest with antiquated technologies not designed or purpose-built for the new requirements of the intelligence economy.
Not only are these five pillars becoming more critical for success, but they also introduce additional challenges for organizations that existing solutions are not equipped to address.
Our Solution
We unlock the power of data with advanced analytics based on our proprietary machine learning technology to identify and predict anomalies in real time, separating the signal from the noise and allowing users to get continuous insights, even when they do not know what questions to ask. Our multi-tenant, cloud-native platform was architected by big data and security experts and has been in operation continuously for nearly a decade. We began by solving the more difficult log and machine data analytics challenges, and 
then evolved our platform very early on to also integrate and analyze more simple structured monitoring and time-series data to provide a comprehensive, cloud-native, continuous intelligence solution.
As a result, we deliver analytics and insights across a wide range of use cases for a diverse user base of technical and non-technical individuals across development, IT operations, security, and other lines of business including product, customer success, and executives. Our user-friendly dashboards can be used out-of-the-box or easily customized and personalized for monitoring workloads, alerting users to performance issues, investigating anomalies, detecting threats, responding to security incidents, and predicting customer churn. Our Continuous Intelligence Platform allows users to further derive insights and intelligence through various integrations with domain-specific data science tools and technologies.
Our customers leverage our Continuous Intelligence Platform for four main solution areas:
•Operational Intelligence: Customers utilize our platform to build, monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their applications and infrastructure. Modern applications require modern observability powered by AI/ML and utilize more than just one type of data—logs, events, metrics, metadata, traces, and other telemetry generated by machines. Our Continuous Intelligence Platform enables users to rapidly understand the root cause of poor performance in their application stack, such as a line of faulty code, an incorrect configuration error, architectural issue caused by poor performing infrastructure, or a capacity issue. The ability to quickly troubleshoot results in faster deployment of new code, significantly reduced downtime, and an enhanced customer experience.
•Security Intelligence: Sumo Logic’s cloud-native analytics capabilities can detect real-time threats and incidents, as well as provide consolidated lists of indicators of compromise that enables analysts to accelerate investigations across their multi-cloud environments. Our algorithms utilize correlations and pattern recognition to detect threats, and then deploy custom alerts to automate the appropriate incident response for the SOC. Further, our cloud SIEM solutions go beyond reporting and into continuous intelligence, allowing IT operations and security analysts to conduct deep investigations into all their log data, as opposed to surface-level, metrics-based analysis. In addition, we enable our customers to leverage our Continuous Intelligence Platform to comply with and adhere to various audit, compliance, and regulatory requirements.
•Business Intelligence: Sumo Logic’s abilities extend into line of business users to enable real-time, data-driven decision making. Our solution extracts valuable business, service, or other critical KPIs from existing data to predict and analyze customer behavior, engagement, and actions. Our out-of-the-box, analytics-powered dashboards and flexible search language can help business users design and perform a robust set of searches to gain visibility into customer engagement, accelerate time to market, and increase competitive advantages.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to safeguard our core technology and other intellectual property protection for our technology, inventions, improvements, proprietary rights, and other assets. We seek to accomplish that objective by establishing intellectual property rights in and protecting those assets through a combination of patents, patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual measures. As of January 31, 2021, we owned 22 issued U.S. patents, four issued non-U.S. patents, 16 U.S. patent applications, no pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and seven non-U.S. patent applications. Our issued U.S. patents, and any patents that may issue from our pending applications, would be scheduled to expire at dates ranging between June 2031 and August 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or extensions. In addition, as of January 31, 2021, we owned 14 registered trademarks in the United States, no pending trademark applications in the United States, as well as 22 registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions and 8 pending trademark applications in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also license software from third parties for integration into our platform, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
Additionally, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and customers, and generally limiting access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our offerings or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and time consuming. Third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. The laws, procedures, and restrictions on which we rely may provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property against us, our customers, or our channel partners, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims.
 See the section titled “Risk Factors—We face intense competition and could face pricing pressure from, and lose market share to, our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations” for additional information. 
 See the section titled “Risk Factors—Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights would harm our business” for additional information. 
Employees and Human Capital
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees and consultants. In addition to competitive base salaries and cash compensation, the principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. In addition to traditional employee benefits, we have implemented a number of innovative initiatives to support the well-being of our employee base.
As of January 31, 2021, we had a total of 759 employees located in 13 countries. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. None of our U.S. employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
