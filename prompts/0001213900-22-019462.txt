ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview




On June 6, 2021, Boston Therapeutics and Nanomix, Inc., or Nanomix, completed a reverse merger, or the Merger, resulting in the formation of Nanomix Corporation (the “Company”).. As consideration for the Merger, The Company issued to the shareholders of Nanomix 1,000,000 shares of a newly created Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Preferred Stock”). On March 2, 2022, all such shares of Preferred Stock issued to Nanomix shareholders automatically converted into approximately 35,644,997 shares of common stock of the Company, the warrants assumed at closing may be exercisable into approximately 2,124,687 shares of common stock of the Company and the options and restricted stock units assumed at closing may be exercisable into approximately 5,718,838 shares of common stock of the Company. The shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock together with warrants, restricted stock units and options assumed on the closing date represent approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company upon closing of the Merger. After the merger, the Company changed its name to Nanomix Corporation and its ticker symbol to NNMX. A previously approved 173:1 reverse stock split was effective on March 2, 2022.




After the Merger, our primary focus is on the development and commercialization of Nanomix’s advanced mobile Point-of-Care, or POC, diagnostic system that can be used in performing a wide range of in vitro diagnostic tests in many environments. Nanomix’s goal is to provide laboratory quality testing for time sensitive medical conditions, at the first point of contact that a patient has with the healthcare system, no matter where that occurs. The Nanomix eLab® system is CE Marked, a 510(k) application is currently in development, and Emergency Use Application (EUA) for COVID antigen testing has been submitted to the FDA. Nanomix intends to market and sell this system for the detection and diagnosis of a variety of time sensitive medical conditions.



Prior to the Merger, we were a pre-clinical and clinical-stage pharmaceutical development company focused on the clinical development, outsourced contract manufacture and test marketing for commercialization of carbohydrate-based patented formulation of investigative materials as medical food, supplements, drug and drug combination, and other clinical exploratory outsourced exploratory peptide therapeutic options. Due to limited funding and the merger, our activity including any drug development during year ended December 31, 2021 was severely limited. Following the closing of the Merger, the Company intends to conduct a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for our legacy products and product candidates pertaining to the commercialization of our therapeutic drugs including SUGARDOWN®, BTI-320 and IPOXYN. The Company does not expect to receive any form of material consideration in connection with such alternatives. In the event it is not able to dispose of these assets, the Company expects to cease all operations in connection therewith in order to avoid incurring any further associated expense.




Nanomix eLab System



Nanomix believes that quality healthcare should be available to consumers anywhere and anytime. The foundation of quality healthcare is timely information supporting a proper diagnosis and associated treatment. Our vision is to make healthcare accessible to patients without compromise, by delivering the highest quality, fastest, most cost-effective and portable detection systems that bring the patient and caregiver closer together.



The Nanomix eLab System is a proprietary diagnostic platform developed by Nanomix to meet the growing need for decentralized medical diagnostic solutions. The platform is designed to provide rapid test results in a handheld device at the first point of patient contact in locations that range from Emergency Departments, to long term and assisted care facilities, to urgent care and emergency medical response settings.





1







The Nanomix eLab system is a rapid, easy-to-use, quantitative detection platform that performs a range of in vitro diagnostic assays, such as electrochemical immunoassay and enzymatic assays. The platform consists of a hand-held analyzer and a disposable cartridge. The eLab System utilizes a proprietary nano-biosensor with multiple detection electrodes to generate multiple electrochemical assay results from a single patient sample. Specificity is generated by functionalizing each of the electrodes on the sensor for particular biomarkers. The sensor is incorporated into a single-use consumable microfluidics cartridge that processes the biological sample and reports its results through the handheld eLab System.



The eLab system is designed to be operated by medical and non-medically trained persons. An assay is run by inserting the cartridge into the eLab Analyzer. Following the prompts on the Analyzer interface, the user identifies the subject, scans a barcode on the consumable package, loads the test sample into the cartridge, and presses start. Assay results generally take between 10 and 15 minutes, from sample collection to answer. A wide variety of biomolecules with varying chemistries can be tested on a single device in one operation. The electrochemical detection system eliminates the need for ongoing instrument calibration and maintenance commonly associated with optical systems. Wireless connectivity provides for transmission of patient results to other devices for data sharing, management, and EMR integration.



Compared with other POC testing systems, the Nanomix eLab system provides testing in traditional laboratories as well as non-traditional decentralized environments with enhanced sensitivity and specificity, advanced multiplexing and multimodal capabilities, quantitative results, Bluetooth communication of results and an on board electronic data base of testing activities. The Nanomix eLab® system is CE Marked, a 510(k) is currently in development, and a COVID-19 Antigen test has been submitted to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization.



Our strategy is to develop a menu of diagnostic tests for the detection and diagnosis of time sensitive medical conditions on the Nanomix eLab Analyzer and to sell, market and distribute the eLab Analyzer and associated tests on a worldwide basis.



Products



The Nanomix eLab is an in vitro diagnostic test platform for the quantitative determination of analytes in biological samples that include plasma, whole blood, and nasal swab specimens. The eLab system consists of a handheld analyzer, a sample transfer device and a disposable cartridge. The Nanomix eLab is a platform technology and Nanomix intends to develop a range of test cartridges compatible with Nanomix eLab analyzer. The key advantages of our approach are:

● | Laboratory quality results;
--+----------------------------


● | Multiplexing and multimodal testing;
--+-------------------------------------


● | Quantitative determination of test results;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Operates in distributed environments; and
--+------------------------------------------


● | Electronic record storage with Bluetooth communication of results.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------




The eLab has been shown to be easily operated by non-medically trained personnel. The platform performs immunoassays and enzymatic assays. All tests run on the eLab Analyzer utilize the same disposable cartridge format.



Nanomix’s first product, the S1 Panel Assay for use in aiding the diagnosis of critical infections, received CE marking for the assay and the eLab Analyzer in November of 2019. Filing of a 510(k) was started in 2020 through a third-party reviewer for the CRP assay. With the advent of the Coronavirus pandemic, Nanomix shifted to developing COVID-19 testing products in April of 2020. Preparation of a 510(k) is currently in process.

eLab Analyzer



The eLab Analyzer is a handheld portable instrument that operates via a touch screen using a simple instruction menu. The analyzer works from a rechargeable battery or wall power and can be operated during recharging. The eLab Analyzer contains electronics, a pneumatic system, a barcode scanner, data storage, USB connections, and Bluetooth communications. To use the eLab system, an operator signs into the system and then follows the prompts on the eLab screen to run an assay, run controls, or review past test results. To run a test, the operator scans or enters a patient ID and scans the consumable test package using the built-in bar code scanner. The barcode contains information about the test including manufacturing lot codes and expiration dating for the consumable. The operator loads the patient sample into the disposable cartridge and inserts the cartridge into the eLab analyzer. The operator is then prompted on the screen to activate the assay. The eLab automatically runs through to completion using the programmed test protocol specific for that assay. At conclusion of the test protocol, results are displayed on the screen and can be sent electronically via Bluetooth as selected by the operator. All test information is recorded in the onboard database. The instrument includes a robust control system and, if there are errors in processing, the eLab displays an error code on the screen.



COVID-19 Rapid IgG/IgM Test Panel



The Nanomix eLab COVID-19 Rapid IgG/IgM Panel is an electrochemical immunoassay test intended for qualitative detection of IgG and IgM antibodies (without differentiation) to SARS-CoV-2 in human venous whole blood and plasma (K2EDTA, lithium-heparin, sodium-heparin, sodium citrate).



Venous whole blood or plasma samples are collected and using a provided transfer device the sample is transferred to the single-use, microfluidic cartridge. The cartridge is then run on Nanomix eLab Analyzer, which will display results after about 10 minutes. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is determined using a quantitative electrochemical reading which is then compared to a cutoff level to report a qualitative result of positive or negative.



An EUA for the COVID-19 Rapid IgG/IgM Test Panel was filed with the FDA in July 2020. In April of 2021, the FDA notified us that given the volume of EUA requests the Agency had received, FDA is having to prioritize EUA requests and they will not be reviewing our product as filed.  Nanomix is currently tracking use cases and reviewing alternative approaches to market the COVID antibody test. 



COVID-19 Antigen Test Panel



The Nanomix eLab COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Panel is an electrochemical immunoassay test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid antigens from SARS-CoV-2 in nasal (anterior nares) swabs from individuals who are suspected of COVID-19.



Nasal swab samples are collected using a provided swab and sample collection tube, then transferred to the single-use, microfluidic cartridge. The cartridge is then run on Nanomix eLab Analyzer, which will display results after about 15 minutes. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen is determined using a quantitative electrochemical reading which is then compared to a cutoff level to report a qualitative result of positive or negative.



An EUA for the COVID-19 Antigen Test panel was submitted to the FDA in February of 2021. The Company received comments from the FDA in May and conducted further clinical and analytical work identified by the FDA. The EUA for the COVID-19 Antigen Test panel was resubmitted to the FDA in November. The FDA has requested additional data primarily from clinical testing sites prior to beginning their formal review. Given reductions in COVID-19 infection rates and the timing of any potential EUA, the Company doesn’t expect significant revenue to be produced by the COVID-19 Antigen Test panel..



S1 Assay Panel



The S1 Assay panel was developed as an aid in rapidly diagnosing critical infections including sepsis. The panel provides quantitative tests results for Lactate (LAC), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) from a single plasma sample. A venous whole blood sample type is expected to be added to the S1 Assay in 2022. The assay runs on the eLab Analyzer with results available in approximately 11 minutes, providing information rapidly versus the current diagnostic solutions which can take hours to provide a test result.



The Nanomix S1 Panel Cartridge quantitatively measures two biomarkers, CRP, and PCT and the metabolite Lactate (LAC) in lithium heparinized (Li-heparinized) plasma specimens.



CRP test results can be used to evaluate infection, tissue injury, and inflammatory disorders.

PCT test results can be used:




● | To aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy for patient with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) defined as community acquired pneumonia (CAP) acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in an inpatient setting or Emergency Department.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To aid in antibiotic decision making from therapy to discontinuation of treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression of severe sepsis and septic shock.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with sever sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in the emergency department of other medical wards prior to ICU admission, using a change in PCT level over time.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




LAC test results can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis, monitoring tissue hypoxia, and diagnosis of hyperlactatemia and septicemia.



Each of the three tests provides important information about a patient’s condition. Having all three of these answers in a short time period provides a healthcare provider with important information about the patient’s status within the clinical window for infection diagnosis. All of the test results are used in the context of other information about the patient.



Initial customer evaluation of the S1 Assay Panel is underway in the United Kingdom. Additional customer evaluations are scheduled for Madrid, Spain.



S1 Assay Panel use in Sepsis



One potential use of the S1 Assay panel is in the diagnosis of Sepsis. Sepsis has been highlighted as a global health crisis and there is intense pressure to improve management of sepsis from early identification to administration of antimicrobial therapy, monitoring and de-escalation of therapy.



Sepsis is the body’s overwhelming and life-threatening response to infection that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. There are more than 49 million cases of Sepsis annually with more the 6 million associated deaths. Sepsis is the #1 cost of hospitalization in the U.S with costs for acute sepsis hospitalization and skilled nursing estimated to be $62 billion annually. As many as 87% of sepsis cases start in the community. According to the Sepsis Alliance, Mortality from sepsis increases 8% every hour that treatment is delayed. As many as 80% of sepsis deaths could be prevented with rapid diagnosis and treatment.



Sepsis testing and diagnosis can be viewed as a 2-stage process:




● | Immediate patient testing and assessment focused on emergency treatment decisions, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Specific diagnosis of bacterial or fungal pathogen
--+---------------------------------------------------




The Nanomix S1 test panel focuses on the first phase, the need for rapid screening or patients suspected of sepsis. The S1 test panel provides an easy to use, rapid test at the first point of patient contact to deliver important information about the patient’s condition. The panel includes Lactate, the current tool most used in sepsis screening, and adds two other tests (CRP and PCT) that are currently used to confirm a diagnosis. By using our multiplexing and multimodal technology, we are able to bring all three of these test results from a single sample to healthcare providers in an 11-minute test providing clinicians with host response diagnostics at the time of initial evaluation, in any care setting, may help assess the following questions and advance standards of care: 1) is there an infection or not? 2) is the infection viral or bacterial? 3) what is the severity and deficit of tissue perfusion?



Once hospitalized, a sepsis patient spends on average 8 days in an ICU. The S1 panel can also be used to monitor the progress of a patient and to support modification or discontinuation of antibiotic therapy.

Partnerships and Licensees



RedPharm (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (RedPharm) has the right to produce eLab cartridges for the S1 Assay panel in the PRC and has the right to sell and distribute the S1 Assay panel in the PRC, Japan, Korea, and other countries in Southeast Asia.
Sales Channels




We recently established our sales and marketing function. We intend our products to be sold globally, both directly and through distributors, to hospitals and clinics, clinical laboratories, and other healthcare entities such as assisted living, extended care, and other non-hospital-based care facilities. We have limited product distribution, and our new sales and marketing team is working to build our product distribution capabilities in key markets such as North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.




Currently RedPharm has rights to distribute our products in PRC, Japan, Korea, and countries in Southeast Asia. We are also actively developing distribution partners in the United Kingdom, European Union and Southeast Asia. To support our distributor’s efforts, we plan to build a distribution sales and technical support capability within the company.



Manufacturing



We currently have limited manufacturing capacity for our consumable test cartridges and plan to implement automated production processes in the U.S. and bring on additional manufacturing resources to expand consumable test cartridge manufacturing capacity. We depend on several single source vendors to supply components for our disposable test cartridge and a US-based contract manufacturer for our eLab analyzer. We plan to bring on additional component suppliers to add supply chain capacity as well as backup. We have completed the purchase of a significant supply of printed electrodes from a former vendor and plan to qualify a new vendor of electrodes.



Sensor functionalization (converting raw electrodes into a biosensor) is currently done by Nanomix using a robotic system and final cartridge assembly is done by Nanomix manually. We plan to invest significantly in increasing capacity of sensor manufacturing processes and to automate portions of the cartridge assembly processes. The costs of our products are expected to decline significantly with volume growth as well as process automation.



RedPharm has the right to produce eLab cartridges in the PRC.



The Nanomix eLab analyzer is produced by a contract manufacturer located in the United States. While this is not an exclusive supply arrangement, it would be difficult to transfer production or add an additional supplier. The production of instruments is done on a purchase order basis. Nanomix purchases and consigns the materials for the quantity of instruments on the purchase order. The contract manufacturer builds, tests, and ships the units and invoices Nanomix based on the units shipped less the cost of the consigned materials. Some of the components used in the eLab analyzer have long lead times and Nanomix will purchase many of those components in quantities beyond the current purchase order.

We believe our technical capabilities and proprietary know-how relating to our eLab system are strong, particularly for the development of tests for critical care conditions in decentralized care environments. However, there are a number of competitive technologies used and/or seeking to be used by others in point-of-care settings.



Although we have no specific knowledge of any other competitors’ products that could render our products obsolete, if we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position or fail to introduce new products and product features, our customers may decide to use the products developed by our competitors, which could result in a loss of revenues and cash flow.



Employees



As of December 31, 2021, we had 25 full-time equivalent employees, of whom 3 were in administration, 11 in research and development and engineering, 8 in manufacturing and quality, and 3 in sales and marketing. The majority of our employees are located in San Leandro, California.



We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or subject to any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.



Governmental Regulation



Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and export of diagnostic products. Our clinical laboratory customers are subject to oversight by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, pursuant to CLIA, as well as agencies in various states. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, civil money penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.



FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements



Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the United States must receive 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval (PMA). Medical devices that receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the FDA to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that obtain a PMA by the FDA are “approved” to market, distribute and sell in the United States. We cannot be certain that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will ever be obtained for any products that we develop. Descriptions of the PMA and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.



The FDA decides whether a device must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or PMA based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices and, in many cases, Class II medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The FDA uses these criteria to decide whether a PMA or a 510(k) is appropriate, including the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination by the agency of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II. In many cases, the FDA requires the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) requesting clearance (also referred to as a premarket notification), unless an exemption applies. The 510(k) must demonstrate that the manufacturer’s proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device. A “predicate device” is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I or Class II or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application.





7







Device classification depends on the device’s intended use and its indications for use. In addition, classification is risk-based, that is, the risk the device poses to the patient and/or the user is a major factor in determining the class to which it is assigned. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk and Class III includes those with the greatest risk.



Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the General Controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) process.



Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) process. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process.



Class III includes devices with the greatest risk. Devices in this class must meet all of the requirements in Classes I and II. In addition, Class III devices cannot be marketed until they receive Premarket Approval.



The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Under Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, PMA applications (and supplemental premarket approval applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than 510(k) applications, and they also require considerably more time and resources.



510(k) Clearance Pathway



We are currently developing products that either will or are likely to require an FDA 510(k) clearance. We anticipate submitting a 510(k) for each such product to demonstrate that such proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a 510(k). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months but could take longer. In some cases, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.



If a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a PMA. The FDA requires each device manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) or a PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and, if it disagrees with the manufacturer’s determination, can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA of the modified device is obtained.

 

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988



A manufacturer of a test categorized as moderately complex may request that categorization of the test be waived through a CLIA Waiver (CW) by Application submission to the FDA. When a test is categorized as waived, it may be performed by laboratories with a Certificate of Waiver, such as a physician’s office or other outreach setting. In a CW submission, the manufacturer provides evidence to the FDA that a test meets the CLIA statutory criteria for waiver CLIA, a walk-in clinic or an emergency room provides CMS authority over all laboratory testing, except research that is performed on humans in the United States. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group under the CMS, has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA program.



The CLIA program is designed to establish quality laboratory testing by ensuring the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Under CLIA, a laboratory is a facility that does laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans and used to provide information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or impairment of, or assessment of health. Under the CLIA program, unless waived, laboratories must be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to inspections and pay fees. We anticipate requesting CLIA Waiver for the tests we develop.
