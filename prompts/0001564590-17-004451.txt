Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company with research and development programs broadly falling into two categories: (i) new chemical entities derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program, in which we attempt to discover and develop molecules which have not previously been approved and marketed as therapeutics, and (ii) Drug Delivery Programs, in which we apply our formulation expertise and technologies largely to active pharmaceutical ingredients whose safety and efficacy have previously been established but which we aim to improve in some manner through a new formulation. We also manufacture and sell osmotic pumps used in laboratory research and design, develop and manufacture a wide range of standard and custom biodegradable polymers and excipients for pharmaceutical and medical device clients for use as raw materials in their products.
 Our product pipeline currently consists of multiple investigational drug candidates in clinical development.  DUR‑928, a new chemical entity in Phase 1 development, is the lead candidate in DURECT’s Epigenetic Regulator Program.  An endogenous, orally bioavailable small molecule, DUR-928 has been shown in preclinical studies to play an important regulatory role in lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and cell survival.  Human applications may include acute organ injury, chronic metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other liver diseases with both broad and orphan populations, and inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis.  DURECT’s advanced oral, injectable, and transdermal delivery technologies are designed to enable new indications and enhanced attributes for small-molecule and biologic drugs. One late-stage development program in this category is POSIMIR® (SABER®-Bupivacaine), an investigational analgesic product intended to deliver bupivacaine to provide up to 3 days of pain relief after surgery.  Another late stage development program is REMOXY® ER (oxycodone), an investigational extended release pain relief drug based on DURECT’s ORADUR® technology.
 A central aspect of our business strategy involves advancing multiple product candidates at one time, which is enabled by leveraging our resources with those of corporate collaborators. Thus, certain of our programs are currently licensed to corporate collaborators on terms which typically call for our collaborator to fund all or a substantial portion of future development costs and then pay us milestone payments based on specific development or commercial achievements plus a royalty on product sales. At the same time, we have retained the rights to other programs, which are the basis of potential future collaborations and which over time may provide a pathway for us to develop our own commercial, sales and marketing organization.
 New Chemical Entities from our Epigenetic Regulator Program
 Our Epigenetic Regulator Program involves a multi-year collaborative effort with the Department of Internal Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), the VCU Medical Center and the McGuire VA Medical Center. The discoveries from this program are a result of more than 20 years of lipid research by Shunlin Ren, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Internal Medicine at the VCU Medical Center and a recipient of multiple grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for metabolic disease research. Epigenetics is the study of how reversible modifications of a cell’s DNA or histones (proteins associated with DNA) affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetics is the study of large scale effects on cellular function and interrelated collections of epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in regulation of key cellular processes. DUR-928 is the program’s lead product candidate. We hold the exclusive worldwide right to develop and commercialize DUR-928 and related molecules discovered in the program.

Product Candidate | Disease/Indication | Collaborator | Stage 
------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------
• DUR-928, oral | • Metabolic disorders / chronic liver diseases | • DURECT holds worldwide development and commercialization rights under a license with Virginia Commonwealth University | • Phase 1 
• DUR-928, injectable | • Acute organ injuries | • DURECT holds worldwide development and commercialization rights under a license with Virginia Commonwealth University | • Phase 1

During the course of this program, a number of compounds have been identified that may have therapeutic utility for various diseases and syndromes for orphan indications as well as for broader patient populations. The lead compound from this program (DUR-928) is an endogenous, orally available small molecule that modulates the activity of various nuclear receptors that play an important regulatory role in lipid homeostasis, inflammation and cell survival.
 The biological activity of DUR-928 has been demonstrated in over 10 different animal disease models involving three animal species. Five of these disease models represent chronic disorders of hepatic lipid accumulation and dysfunction (e.g., nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with diabetes) and five represent acute organ injuries (endotoxin shock, kidney, liver and brain).
 We are pursuing the development of DUR-928 through three broad programs for: (i) chronic metabolic disorders or liver diseases using an oral formulation, (ii) acute organ injury using an injectable formulation, and (iii) inflammatory skin disorders such as psoriasis using a topical formulation. We are also evaluating additional indications beyond these programs.
 In pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies conducted in mice, hamsters, rats, dogs and monkeys, DUR-928 has been found to be orally available and safe at all doses tested to date. These non-clinical results supported the initiation of DUR-928 into human safety trials with an oral formulation. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies with an injectable formulation were also conducted in rats and dogs; these non-clinical results supported the initiation of DUR-928 into human safety trials with an injectable formulation.
 Chronic Metabolic Disease Program with DUR-928
 Market Opportunity.    Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects approximately 30% of adults and 10% of children (about 81 million individuals) in the U.S. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe and progressive form of NAFLD, is one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide, with an estimated 
 2

prevalence of more than 10% of adults in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other developed countries. No drug is currently approved for NAFLD or NASH. In addition to these large populations of patients with liver disease, there are a number of orphan patient populations with various forms of liver disease for which we may seek to develop DUR-928, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
 Clinical Program.    The initial Phase 1 trial of DUR-928 was a single-site, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose study that evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of DUR-928 when orally administered. The 30-subject study evaluated DUR-928 in five cohorts of healthy volunteers receiving DUR-928 (n=20 on drug, 10 on placebo) at escalating doses that resulted in peak plasma concentrations greater than 100-fold higher than endogenous levels. DUR-928 was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported. We subsequently conducted a Phase 1 multiple-ascending-dose, oral administration trial in 20 healthy subjects (n=16 on drug, 4 on placebo). Following multiple dosing, DUR-928 was well-tolerated at all doses, with no clinically significant changes in vital signs, laboratory values or ECG parameters, no serious drug-related adverse events reported and no subjects withdrawing from the study. Peak plasma concentrations achieved were greater than 100-fold higher than endogenous levels, no accumulation in plasma concentrations were observed with repeat dosing, and dose related increases in plasma concentrations were observed with peak plasma concentration at approximately 2-6 hours after dosing. We also conducted a food effect study with 8 healthy volunteers and observed no food effect on absorption.
 
Our first patient trial utilizing DUR-928 was an open-label, single-ascending-dose safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) Phase 1b trial in liver function impaired (NASH) patients and matched control subjects (matched by age, body mass index and gender with normal liver function).  This study was conducted in Australia in successive cohorts evaluating single-dose levels (first a low dose and then a high dose) of orally administered DUR-928.  
 
An abstract for this study has been accepted and data from the study will be presented at the International Liver Congress™ 2017 organized by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in Amsterdam, April 19-23, 2017. In addition, an abstract describing our two STAM™ NASH mouse model studies has been accepted at the AASLD Emerging Trends Conference 2017: Emerging Trends in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Washington, DC.  That data will be presented on March 17, 2017.
 
The low dose cohort consisted of 10 subjects with NASH (of which 4 were cirrhotic and 6 were not cirrhotic) and 6 matched control subjects.  After a PK/safety review of this cohort, the study proceeded to the high dose cohort utilizing a dose four times larger than the low dose cohort.  The high dose cohort consisted of 10 subjects with NASH (of which 2 were cirrhotic and 8 were not cirrhotic) and 6 matched control subjects.  One patient (with a prior history of arrhythmia and an ongoing viral infection) in the high dose cohort experienced a serious adverse event (shortness of breath) which occurred without unusual biochemical changes and resolved without intervention but was considered possibly treatment related by the physician due to its temporal association with dosing.  In both the low and high dose cohorts, the PK parameters were comparable between the NASH patients and the matched control subjects.  In addition, the systemic exposure following the low and high doses of DUR-928 was dose dependent.
 
While this study was not designed to assess efficacy, we observed a dose dependent reduction of certain biomarkers after a single oral dose of DUR-928.   In both cohorts, IL-18, an inflammatory mediator implicated in both liver and kidney diseases, decreased hours after DUR-928 dosing, with the effect greater in the NASH patients.  Full length CK-18 (a generalized cell death marker) and cleaved CK-18 (a cell apoptosis marker) were both greatly reduced after low and high doses of DUR-928, with the effect, again, more pronounced in NASH patients.
 
Collectively, the reduction of these biomarkers plus results from our animal and cell culture studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of DUR-928 for patients with liver disease.  However, additional studies are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DUR-928, and there is no assurance that these biomarker effects will be observed in a statistically significant manner, or that DUR-928 will demonstrate safety or efficacy in treating NASH or other liver diseases in larger controlled trials.

Acute Organ Injury Program with DUR-928
 Market Opportunity.    Acute organ injury, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and other conditions, is another area of major unmet medical need for which effective pharmaceutical treatment is often lacking. AKI alone, for example, affects approximately 2.8 million patients per year in the U.S. and is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and worsening of chronic kidney disease. In addition to this large population of patients, there are a number of orphan and broad patient populations with various forms of acute organ injury for which we may seek to develop DUR-928.
 Clinical Program.    In addition to the oral administration clinical studies described above, we have conducted a Phase 1 single-site, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose study that evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of four doses of DUR-928 when administered by injection. The 24-subject study evaluated DUR-928 in four cohorts of healthy volunteers (16 subjects on the drug, 8 on placebo) at escalating doses that resulted in dose proportionality of systemic exposure. DUR-928 was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported. We also conducted a multiple-dose study involving 10 healthy volunteers, in which participants received DUR-928 for 5 consecutive days (8 subjects on the drug, 2 on placebo) with the next to highest dose in the single dose study. No serious treatment related adverse events were reported, no subjects withdrew from the study, no accumulation in plasma concentrations were observed with repeat dosing, and the pain scores and injection site reactions were minimal. We also conducted a single-ascending-dose intravenous infusion (IV) study with 16 healthy volunteers and observed no treatment related serious adverse events and the systemic exposure related to IV infusion was dose proportional.
 
Our second Phase 1b study with DUR-928, also being conducted in Australia, is an open-label, single-ascending-dose safety and pharmacokinetic study in patients with impaired kidney function (stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease) and matched control subjects (matched by age, body mass and gender with normal kidney function).  This study is being conducted in successive cohorts evaluating single-dose levels (first a low dose and then a high dose) of DUR-928 administered by intramuscular injection.  
 
The low dose cohort consisting of 6 kidney function impaired patients and 3 matched control subjects has been completed.  After a PK/safety review of this cohort, the study has proceeded to the high dose cohort utilizing a dose four times larger than the low dose cohort.  Data from the low dose cohort showed the PK parameters between the kidney function impaired patients and the matched control subjects were comparable. The high dose cohort of this study is currently enrolling patients.   
 
We have been working with our clinical advisors to design several Phase 2 studies and are planning to submit INDs which are required to enable these studies to take place in the United States in 2017.  In 2016, we held a pre-IND meeting with the Cardiovascular and Renal Products Division of the FDA, and we are utilizing feedback from that meeting as well as from our clinical advisors to prepare an IND which is required to enable a future Phase 2 kidney disease clinical trial in the United States. In addition, we submitted an initial IND in late December 2016 for a proposed Phase 2 liver study.  The FDA has requested certain drug-drug interaction data and has made suggestions as to modifications to our proposed protocol.  We are working to address FDA’s request and are consulting with our clinical advisors to finalize the study protocol.
 Psoriasis Program with DUR-928
 
Market opportunity.  Psoriasis is an autoimmune / inflammatory skin condition that affects approximately 7.5 million Americans.  It is generally considered to be undertreated and there is treatment dissatisfaction.  Current treatments consist of topicals, typically as first line therapy that seek to slow down or normalize excessive cell reproduction and reduce inflammation associated with psoriasis.  Steroids are the most commonly used topical treatments and they are referred to as anti-inflammatory agents because they reduce the swelling and redness of lesions.  If topicals are insufficient, then systemic medications are used which may entail safety concerns.
 
Clinical program.  We conducted an initial exploratory Phase 1b trial in psoriasis patients (n = 9 evaluable patients) in Australia.  The decision to proceed with clinical testing in psoriasis was based on the anti-inflammatory and cell survival properties of DUR-928, including the downregulation of IL-17, full length CK-18, cleaved CK-18, 
 4

as well as the results of a psoriasis study with DUR-928 in mice. The Phase 1b trial was conducted with intradermal micro injections of DUR-928, and we feel the results warrant further investigation.  As a result, we have developed several topical formulations of DUR-928 that we are evaluating for a topical application Phase 1b microplaque trial which we expect to commence this year.   
 Drug Delivery Programs and Pharmaceutical Systems
 We are developing pharmaceutical systems that will deliver the right drug to the right place, in the right amount and at the right time to treat chronic and episodic diseases and conditions. Our pharmaceutical systems enable optimized therapy for a given disease or patient population by controlling the rate and duration of drug administration. In addition, if advantageous for the therapy, our pharmaceutical systems can target the delivery of the drug to its intended site of action.
 Our pharmaceutical systems are suitable for providing long-term drug therapy because they store highly concentrated, stabilized drugs in a small volume and can protect the drug from degradation by the body. This, in combination with our ability to continuously deliver precise and accurate doses of a drug, allows us to extend the therapeutic value of a wide variety of drugs, including those which would otherwise be ineffective, too unstable, too potent or cause adverse side effects. In some cases, delivering the drug directly to the intended site of action can improve efficacy while minimizing unwanted side effects elsewhere in the body, which often limit the long-term use of many drugs. Our pharmaceutical systems can thus provide better therapy for chronic diseases or conditions, or for certain acute conditions where longer drug dosing is required or advantageous, by replacing multiple injection therapy or oral dosing, improving drug efficacy, reducing side effects and ensuring dosing compliance. Our pharmaceutical systems can improve patients’ quality of life by eliminating more repetitive treatments, reducing dependence on caregivers and allowing patients to lead more independent lives.
 We currently have several major active drug delivery technology platforms:
 The SABER and CLOUD Bioerodible Injectable Depot Systems
 Our bioerodible injectable depot systems include our SABER and CLOUD platform technologies. SABER uses a high viscosity base component, such as sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB), to provide controlled release of a drug. When the high viscosity SAIB is formulated with drug, biocompatible excipients and other additives, the resulting formulation is easily injectable with standard syringes and needles. After injection of a SABER formulation, the excipients diffuse away, leaving a viscous depot which provides controlled sustained release of drug. CLOUD is a class of bioerodible injectable depot technology which generally does not contain SAIB but includes various other release rate modifying excipients and/or bioerodible polymers to achieve the delivery of drugs for periods of days to months from a single injection. We are researching and developing a variety of controlled-release products based on the SABER and CLOUD technologies. Based on research and development work to date, our bioerodible injectable depot technologies have shown the following advantages:

• | Peptide/Protein/Small Molecule Delivery—The chemical nature of our bioerodible injectable depot systems tend to repel water and body enzymes from its interior and thereby stabilizes proteins and peptides. For this reason, we believe that bioerodible injectable depot systems are well suited as a platform for biotechnology therapeutics based on proteins and peptides.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Controlled Onset and Release—Typically, controlled release injections are associated with an initial higher release of drug immediately after injection (also called “burst”). Animal and human studies have shown that our bioerodible injectable depots can be associated with less post-injection burst than is typically associated with other commercially available injectable controlled release technologies, while still achieving controlled rapid onset of drug concentration.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High Drug Loading—Drug loading in our bioerodible injectable depot formulations can be as high as 30%, considerably greater than is typical with other commercially available injectable controlled release technologies. As a result, smaller injection volumes are possible with this technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Administration—Prior to injection, our bioerodible injectable depot formulations are fairly liquid and therefore can be injected through small needles. Additionally, because of the higher drug
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

concentration of our bioerodible injectable depot formulations, less volume is required to be injected. Small injection volumes and more liquid solutions are expected to result in easier, less painful administration.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patent Protection—Our bioerodible injectable depot technology is covered by United States and foreign patents. See “Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights” below.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Manufacture—Compared to microspheres and other polymer-based controlled release injectable systems, our bioerodible injectable depot formulations are readily manufacturable at low cost.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The SABER technology is the basis of POSIMIR, for which our NDA received a Complete Response Letter in February 2014 and for which we are currently conducting a Phase 3 trial designed to generate additional clinical data with which to address the issues raised in the Complete Response Letter. The SABER technology is also the basis for Relday, which has completed single and multiple dose Phase 1 clinical trials in the U.S. The SABER technology is also utilized in our Santen Ophthalmic Program as well as multiple feasibility programs. In our clinical studies thus far, our bioerodible injectable depot formulations have been observed to be safe and well-tolerated, and no significant side effects or adverse events have been reported.
 The SABER technology is also the basis for SucroMate™ Equine, an injectable animal health drug utilizing our SABER technology to deliver the peptide deslorelin. This is the first FDA approved SABER injectable product and it was launched in 2011 by our collaborator, CreoSalus, Inc.
 The ORADUR Sustained Release Gel Cap Technology
 We believe that our ORADUR sustained release technology can transform short-acting oral capsule dosage forms into sustained release oral products. Products based on our ORADUR technology can take the form of an easy to swallow gelatin capsule that uses a high-viscosity base component such as sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB) to provide controlled release of active ingredients for a period of 12 to 24 hours of drug delivery. Oral dosage forms based on the ORADUR gel-cap may also have the added benefit of being less prone to abuse (e.g., by crushing and then snorting, smoking, injecting or extracting by mixing with alcohol or water) than other controlled release dosage forms on the market today. These properties have the potential to make ORADUR-based products an attractive option for pharmaceutical companies that seek to develop abuse deterrent oral products.
 The ORADUR technology is the basis of REMOXY ER, a unique long-acting oral formulation of the opioid oxycodone designed to discourage common methods of opioid misuse and abuse, and for which Pain Therapeutics received a Complete Response Letter most recently in September 2016. The ORADUR technology has also been applied to develop abuse-deterrent formulations of other opioids, including hydromorphone, hydrocodone and oxymorphone, although these programs are not currently under active development. We also have an ORADUR-ADHD program for which we and Orient Pharma Co., Ltd. (Orient Pharma) have selected a lead formulation containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient methylphenidate. This formulation was selected based on its potential for rapid onset of action, long duration for once-a-day dosing and target pharmacokinetic profile as demonstrated in a Phase 1 trial. Orient Pharma has completed dosing a Phase 3 trial in Taiwan and anticipates obtaining top-line results from that trial in the second quarter of 2017.
 The TRANSDUR Transdermal Delivery System
 Our TRANSDUR technology is a proprietary transdermal delivery system that enables delivery of drugs continuously for multiple days. The TRANSDUR technology is the basis for ELADUR, for which two Phase 2 clinical trials have been conducted and for which we licensed worldwide development and commercialization rights to Impax in January 2014.

Major Drug Delivery Programs
 POSIMIR (SABER-Bupivacaine)
 Market Opportunity.    According to data published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 72 million ambulatory and inpatient surgical procedures performed annually in the U.S. Insufficient postoperative pain control remains a significant problem, with studies indicating that roughly 65% of patients experience moderate-to-extreme pain after surgery. The current standard of care for post-surgical pain includes oral opiate and non-opiate analgesics and muscle relaxants. While systemic opioids can effectively control post-surgical pain, they commonly cause side effects including drowsiness, constipation, nausea and vomiting, and cognitive impairment. Effective pain management can be compromised if patients fail to adhere to recommended dosing regimens because they are suffering from these side effects. Post-surgical pain also can be treated effectively with local anesthetics; however, their usefulness often is limited by their short duration of action.
 Development Strategy.    We are developing POSIMIR, an extended-release formulation of bupivacaine, using our SABER delivery system for the treatment of post-surgical pain. Bupivacaine is an off-patent pharmaceutical agent. The physician would administer POSIMIR at the time of surgery to the surgical site. This formulation is designed to provide extended analgesia from a single dose. We believe that by delivering effective amounts of a potent analgesic to the location from which the pain originates, improved pain control can be achieved with minimal exposure to the remainder of the body and reduced need for systemic analgesics, thus minimizing systemic side effects. POSIMIR is intended to provide local analgesia for up to 3 days, which we believe generally coincides with the time period of greatest need for post-surgical pain control in most patients.
 We are in discussions with potential partners regarding licensing development and commercialization rights to POSIMIR, for which we hold worldwide rights.  We are also continuing to evaluate the requirements for commercializing POSIMIR on our own in the U.S., in the event that we determine that to be the preferred route of commercialization.
 Clinical Program.    Our POSIMIR clinical development program has been devised to establish the safety and efficacy of POSIMIR for the treatment of post-surgical pain for 3 days. Toward that end, 15 clinical studies have been completed, of which 13 clinical studies were with the final formulation of POSIMIR in either blinded, randomized controlled trials or open-label trials. These 15 trials were included in the Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) which was included in the POSIMIR NDA. Seven randomized, controlled, parallel design clinical trials of POSIMIR using the instillation method of administration and dose proposed for marketing were included in the Integrated Summary of Efficacy (ISE) which was included in the NDA. Seven different surgical procedures have been investigated, including inguinal hernia repair, shoulder surgery (primarily subacromial decompression), appendectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, open laparotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and laparoscopic colectomy. The incision lengths treated ranged from a few centimeters for laparoscopic portals, to open laparotomy incisions of up to 35 cm. The seriousness of the surgery ranged from day surgery hernia repair in relatively healthy patients to major abdominal surgery for colon cancer in elderly patients with substantial co-morbidity who were often hospitalized for a week or more. The safety experience from this variety of procedures and patients was designed to allow a more confident extrapolation of the safety and efficacy data to a broad general surgical population.
Safety
 As bupivacaine is a well-known drug with an extensive understanding of its risks and benefits, the safety database in the Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) is not as large as required for a new chemical entity. In the POSIMIR NDA, a total of 1075 patients were included in the ISS database, 951 of whom had been exposed to POSIMIR or SABER-Placebo in volumes ranging from 2.5 to 10 mL. A total of 683 patients had been exposed to POSIMIR with the dose of bupivacaine ranging from 330 to 990 mg. In addition, a total of 124 patients had been treated with bupivacaine HCl in control groups and 268 patients received SABER-Placebo in control groups.
 Overall, the POSIMIR patient groups showed a similar systemic safety profile as the patient groups treated with SABER-Placebo and bupivacaine HCl. Local site reactions were observed more frequently in the POSIMIR and SABER-Placebo groups than in the active comparator groups, most frequently in abdominal surgeries; most of these observations were discolorations (e.g., surgical bruising), the majority of which resolved without treatment 
 7

during the observation period. There was little difference in the incidence of severe or serious adverse events between the POSIMIR, SABER-Placebo and bupivacaine HCl treatment groups. Most of the serious adverse events seen in these trials appear to be due to complications of surgery, anesthesia, analgesics, or co-morbidity and not POSIMIR-related. The clinical history for serious adverse events has been reviewed and no evidence of bupivacaine toxicity was apparent. The adverse event data was analyzed in a variety of ways to detect any evidence of bupivacaine central nervous system or cardiac toxicity or other unexpected effects. No patients treated with POSIMIR had an instance of a severe central nervous system or cardiac adverse event traditionally associated with bupivacaine toxicity.
 Efficacy
 In the NDA, we presented the results from two efficacy trials that we positioned as pivotal (inguinal hernia repair and shoulder surgery, primarily subacromial decompression) and an Integrated Summary of Efficacy (ISE) based on 7 randomized, controlled, parallel design surgical trials of POSIMIR using the administration technique and 5 mL (660 mg) dose proposed for marketing.
 Hernia pivotal efficacy trial
 The hernia pivotal efficacy clinical trial was designed to evaluate the tolerability, activity, dose response and pharmacokinetics of POSIMIR in patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair. The trial was conducted in Australia and New Zealand as a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 122 patients. Study patients were randomized into three treatment groups: patients that were treated with POSIMIR 2.5 mL (n=43), POSIMIR 5 mL (n=47) and placebo (n=32). The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the study were Mean Pain Intensity on Movement area under the curve (AUC), a measure of pain over a period of 1-72 hours post-surgery, and the proportion of patients requiring supplemental opioid analgesic medication during the study (defined as 0-15 days).
 In relation to the co-primary endpoint of pain reduction as measured by Mean Pain Intensity on Movement AUC 1-72 hours post-surgery, the patient group treated with POSIMIR 5 mL reported thirty-one percent (31%) less pain versus placebo, and the result was statistically significant (p=0.0031). Fifty-three percent (53%) of the study patients in the POSIMIR 5 mL group took supplemental opioid analgesic medications versus seventy-two percent (72%) of the placebo patients (p=0.0909). Although this positive trend for this co-primary endpoint in favor of the POSIMIR 5 mL group was not statistically significant, both secondary endpoints measuring opioid analgesic medication consumption were met at a statistically significant level. During the periods of 1-24 hours, 24-48 hours and 48-72 hours after surgery, placebo patients consumed approximately 3.5 (p=0.0009), 2.9 (p=0.0190) and 3.6 (p=0.0172) times more supplemental opioid analgesic medications (mean total daily consumption of opioid analgesic medication in morphine equivalents), respectively, than the POSIMIR 5 mL treatment group. The median decrease in supplemental opioid analgesics taken over the first three days after surgery was 80% (p=0.0085) for the POSIMIR 5 mL group as compared to the placebo group.
 Shoulder pivotal efficacy trial
 The shoulder pivotal efficacy trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response trial conducted at 9 investigational centers in Europe. Nycomed, our collaborator at the time, was responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial. In this study, 107 patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups prior to undergoing elective arthroscopic shoulder surgery: POSIMIR 5 mL (n=53), SABER-Placebo (n=25) or bupivacaine HCl solution (n=29). All patients were given a background pain treatment consisting of a daily dose of two or four grams (depending on the patient’s weight) of paracetamol (acetaminophen). In addition, each patient was provided supplemental opioid rescue medication, if needed. With respect to efficacy, the primary endpoints of the study were to demonstrate: (1) an improvement in terms of pain intensity on movement area under the curve (AUC) during the period 1–72 hours post-surgery, and (2) a decrease in the total use of opioid rescue analgesia 0–72 hours post-surgery.
 Results from this study demonstrate that the POSIMIR group experienced a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity of approximately 20% (p=0.012) versus SABER-Placebo. Applying the appropriate statistical test given the data distribution, the POSIMIR group showed a statistically significant reduction of approximately 67% 
 8

(p=0.013) in median opioid use in favor of POSIMIR. No statistical differences were found when POSIMIR was compared to bupivacaine HCl.
 Phase 3 trial in abdominal surgical procedures
 We also conducted a Phase 3 U.S. and international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial evaluating the safety, efficacy, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetics of POSIMIR in 305 patients undergoing a variety of general abdominal surgical procedures. The trial included the following three cohorts:
 Cohort 1: An active comparator cohort in which patients were randomized to receive either POSIMIR 5 mL or commercially available Bupivacaine HCl solution after laparotomy.
 Cohort 2: An active comparator cohort in which patients were randomized to receive either POSIMIR 5 mL or commercially available Bupivacaine HCl solution after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 Cohort 3: A double blind, placebo controlled cohort in which patients were randomized to receive either POSIMIR 5 mL or SABER-Placebo after laparoscopically-assisted colectomy.
 Efficacy evaluation in the Phase 3 trial encompassed a number of parameters. The two co-primary efficacy endpoints for Cohort 3 were mean pain intensity on movement (normalized) Area Under the Curve (AUC) during the period 0-72 hours post-dose and mean total morphine equivalent opioid dose for supplemental analgesia during the period 0-72 hours post-dose. The purpose of Cohorts 1 and 2 was to give us additional experience with the use of POSIMIR in a broader group of surgeries and patients.
 Cohort 3. With respect to the co-primary efficacy endpoint of pain reduction as measured by mean pain intensity on movement (normalized) Area Under the Curve (AUC) during the period 0-72 hours post-dose, the patient group treated with POSIMIR reported a mean pain reduction in pain scores of approximately 7%, although this was not statistically significant (p=0.1466). The statistical analysis plan included pain on movement as recorded at scheduled times through an electronic diary plus pain scores reported whenever supplemental opioids were administered with such scores attributed as if they were pain on movement. In the prespecified sensitivity analysis (which includes only scheduled pain assessment on movement scores as collected on the electronic diary), the patient group treated with POSIMIR reported approximately 10% less pain versus placebo (p=0.0410). In relation to the co-primary efficacy endpoint of median total morphine-equivalent opioid dose for supplemental analgesia during the period 0-72 hours post-dose, the patient group treated with POSIMIR reported approximately 16% less opioids consumed versus the placebo group, although this was not statistically significant (p=0.5897).
 Cohorts 1 and 2. Cohorts 1 and 2 were prespecified to be pooled due to their small sample size. For Cohorts 1 and 2 (pooled), the mean reduction in pain on movement was approximately 20% and statistically significant (p=0.0111) for the POSIMIR group compared to the patient group treated with bupivacaine HCl. With respect to the median total morphine-equivalent opioid dose for supplemental analgesia during the period 0-72 hours post-dose for Cohorts 1 and 2 (pooled), the patient group treated with POSIMIR reported approximately 18% less opioids consumed compared to the bupivacaine HCl group, although this was not statistically significant (p=0.5455).
 Integrated Summary of Efficacy
 The seven controlled trials in the ISE can be separated into two different surgical types, soft tissue and orthopedic. The four soft tissue trials involved incisions or laparoscopic portals either in the abdomen or in the inguinal area for hernia repair. In these surgeries, the pain producing tissue was primarily soft tissue such as viscera, fascia, muscle, or skin. However, in the three orthopedic surgeries involving shoulder surgery, a major pain producing tissue is bone that has been resected during the procedure. Given that the responsiveness to treatment of these different surgical types may be different, a pooled analysis was conducted separately by tissue type.
 In the soft tissue pooled analysis group comprised of 410 patients, 253 were treated with POSIMIR and 157 were treated with SABER-Placebo. The mean pain intensity was lower during the period 0-72 hours post-dose in the POSIMIR group than in the SABER-Placebo group and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.0099). The median total morphine-equivalent dose during the period 0-72 hours post-dose was lower in the POSIMIR group than in the SABER-Placebo group, however the difference was not statistically significant.
 9

In the orthopedic pooled analysis group comprised of 187 patients, 114 were treated with POSIMIR and 73 were treated with SABER-Placebo. The mean pain intensity during the period 0-72 hours post-dose was lower in the POSIMIR group than in the SABER-Placebo group and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.0205). The median total morphine-equivalent dose during the period 0-72 hours post-dose was lower in the POSIMIR group than in the SABER-Placebo group and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.0025).
 Current Status.    In April 2013, we submitted an NDA as a 505(b)(2) application, which relies in part on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness of a reference drug. In February 2014, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. Based on the Complete Response Letter and subsequent communications with the FDA, we are conducting a new POSIMIR Phase 3 clinical trial (the PERSIST trial) consisting of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery to further evaluate the benefits and risks of POSIMIR. We began recruiting patients for this trial in November 2015 comparing POSIMIR to placebo. Based on advice from the FDA received subsequent to the start of the trial, in April 2016 we decided to amend the PERSIST trial. Starting in August 2016, we began implementing Part 2 of the PERSIST trial to evaluate POSIMIR against standard bupivacaine HCl rather than placebo as we had been doing initially in the study. Additionally, we switched the primary efficacy endpoint (pain reduction on movement) from 0-72 hours after surgery to 0-48 hours after surgery. Assessing pain reduction on movement from 0-72 hours is now the key secondary efficacy endpoint and other efficacy endpoints, including 72-hour opioid use, remain the same. We expect to enroll approximately 264 patients in Part 2 of PERSIST, and we expect this part of the trial to finish dosing patients in the third quarter of 2017. In a previous clinical trial of 50 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, POSIMIR was compared with the active control bupivacaine HCl, against which POSIMIR demonstrated in a post hoc analysis an approximately 25% reduction in pain intensity on movement for the first 3 days after surgery (p=0.024) and for the first 2 days after surgery (p=0.0198), using the same statistical methodology specified for the current trial. There can be no assurance that the PERSIST trial will show similar results, or provide sufficient data for FDA approval.
REMOXY ER (ORADUR-Oxycodone)
 Market Opportunity.    Chronic pain is usually the result of an ongoing condition or significant problem associated with chronic diseases, including cancer, various neurological and skeletal disorders and other ailments such as severe arthritis or a debilitating back injury. As the condition gets worse, the pain often gets worse. Also, long-lasting pain can affect the nervous system to the point where pain persists even if the condition that originally caused the pain is stabilized or improved. This is one reason patients often need stronger pain medication even if their underlying condition has been treated. Chronic pain affects as many as 100 million Americans annually. OxyContin®, a brand name extended-release oral oxycodone-based painkiller, plus other extended release oxycodone-based painkillers, accounted for approximately $2.9 billion in U.S. sales in 2015.
 Development Strategy.    REMOXY ER is an oral, long-acting oxycodone gelatin capsule under development with Pain Therapeutics to which we have licensed exclusive, worldwide, development and commercialization rights under a development and license agreement entered into in December 2002.
 REMOXY ER is formulated with our ORADUR technology and is designed to discourage common methods of opioid misuse. Under the agreement with Pain Therapeutics, subject to and upon the achievement of predetermined development and regulatory milestones, we are entitled to receive milestone payments of up to $3.0 million in the aggregate for REMOXY ER. As of December 31, 2016, we had received $1.5 million in cumulative milestone payments. We also receive reimbursement for our research and development efforts on REMOXY ER, and a manufacturing profit on our supply of key excipients for use in REMOXY ER and other licensed products. In addition, if commercialized, we will receive royalties for REMOXY ER which do not contain an opioid antagonist of between 6.0% to 11.5% of net sales depending on sales volumes.
 Clinical Program.    Pain Therapeutics submitted an NDA for REMOXY ER to the FDA in June 2008, and in November 2008 the FDA accepted the NDA and granted priority review. In December 2008, Pain Therapeutics received a Complete Response Letter for its NDA for REMOXY ER in which the FDA determined that the NDA was not approved. According to Pain Therapeutics, the FDA indicated that additional non-clinical data would be required to support the approval of REMOXY ER, but the FDA had not requested or recommended additional clinical efficacy studies prior to approval. King Pharmaceuticals (King), which had acquired development and commercialization rights for REMOXY ER from Pain Therapeutics, and which was subsequently acquired by 
 10

Pfizer, resubmitted the NDA in December of 2010. On June 23, 2011, a Complete Response Letter from the FDA was received by Pfizer. The FDA’s June 2011 Complete Response Letter raised concerns related to, among other matters, the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls section of the NDA for REMOXY ER. Pfizer undertook efforts to resolve these issues. In October 2013, Pfizer stated that, having achieved technical milestones related to manufacturing, they would continue the development program for REMOXY ER. Following guidance received from the FDA earlier in 2013, Pfizer announced that they were proceeding with the additional clinical studies and other actions required to address the Complete Response Letter. Pfizer stated that these new clinical studies would include, in part, a pivotal bioequivalence study with the modified REMOXY ER formulation to bridge to the clinical data related to the original REMOXY ER formulation, and an abuse-potential study with the modified formulation. In October 2014, Pfizer notified Pain Therapeutics that Pfizer had decided to discontinue development of REMOXY ER, and that Pfizer would return all rights, including responsibility for regulatory activities, to Pain Therapeutics and that Pfizer would continue ongoing activities under the agreement until the scheduled termination date in April 2015. In April 2015, Pain Therapeutics stated that it had resumed responsibility for REMOXY ER under the terms of a letter agreement with Pfizer. In March 2016, Pain Therapeutics resubmitted the NDA for REMOXY ER to the FDA, and in September 2016, Pain Therapeutics received a Complete Response Letter. Based on its review, the FDA has determined that the NDA cannot be approved in its present form and specifies additional actions and data that are needed for drug approval. We understand from its public disclosures that Pain Therapeutics had a meeting with the FDA in February 2017 to discuss the regulatory path forward for REMOXY ER, and that Pain Therapeutics will provide details of this FDA meeting after receipt of the final meeting minutes.
 ORADUR-ADHD Program
 Market Opportunity.    Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral condition that is estimated to affect over 5 million (approximately 9%) of U.S. children ages 3-17, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The principal characteristics of ADHD are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The condition presents itself in childhood and can be life long as a significant number of children with ADHD continue to present symptoms as adults. Over 50% of children with ADHD are estimated to being treated by medication, with stimulants such as amphetamine or methylphenidate as first-line treatments. U.S. sales of ADHD treatments were approximately $10.4 billion in 2016. The 2010 National Survey on Drug Use & Health estimates that 1.1 million Americans over the age of 12 abuse stimulants for euphoric highs and increased performance or wakefulness.
 Development Strategy.    We are developing a drug candidate (ORADUR-ADHD) based on our ORADUR Technology for the treatment of ADHD. This drug candidate is intended to provide once-a-day dosing with added tamper resistant characteristics to address common methods of abuse and misuse of these types of drugs. In August 2009, we entered into a development and license agreement with Orient Pharma, a diversified multinational pharmaceutical, healthcare and consumer products company with headquarters in Taiwan, under which we granted to Orient Pharma development and commercialization rights in certain defined Asian and South Pacific countries to ORADUR-ADHD. We retain rights to North America, Europe, Japan and all other countries not specifically licensed to Orient Pharma. Under our agreement with Orient Pharma, the parties will collaborate to perform a clinical development program through a Phase 2 study intended to produce a data package suitable for further development of the drug candidate by us as well as Orient Pharma in their respective territories. We will be responsible for formulation and study design of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical program which Orient Pharma has agreed to fund and execute. Orient Pharma would be responsible for all remaining development and commercialization activities for ORADUR-ADHD in the licensed territory. If commercialized, we will be entitled to receive a royalty on sales of ORADUR-ADHD by Orient Pharma. Orient Pharma has committed to supply a portion of our commercial requirements in all territories other than the United States for ORADUR-ADHD. In 2013, we and Orient Pharma selected a lead formulation based on its potential for rapid onset of action, long duration for once-a-day dosing and target pharmacokinetic profile as demonstrated in a Phase 1 trial. In addition, this product candidate is expected to utilize a small capsule size relative to the leading existing long-acting products on the market. Orient Pharma has completed dosing a Phase 3 study in Taiwan and anticipates obtaining top line results from that study in the second quarter of 2017. We retain rights to all other territories in the world and are engaged in licensing discussions with other companies.

ELADUR (TRANSDUR-Bupivacaine)
 Market Opportunity.    Pain can arise from a variety of diseases and conditions, and in many instances, pain originates from a localized point in the body and can benefit from treatments which are administered and act locally as opposed to in a systemic fashion. One such example is post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN or post-shingles pain), a debilitating complication of herpes zoster, which is usually defined as the presence of pain at the site of eruption that lasts more than a month after the onset of a zoster eruption. The prevalence of PHN (including PHN lasting more than one year) is estimated to be approximately 144,000 people in the U.S. In addition to PHN, there are a number of other widely prevalent chronic and acute local pain conditions (e.g., neuropathic pain, sprains, strains, and contusions) that could benefit from a locally acting pain product.
 Development Strategy.    Our transdermal bupivacaine patch (ELADUR) is an investigational drug intended to provide continuous delivery of bupivacaine for up to three days from a single application, as compared to a wearing time limited to 12 hours with currently available lidocaine patches. We anticipate that ELADUR will have several potential differentiating attributes compared with currently marketed lidocaine patches, including extended duration of action and better wearability. During 2008, we received Orphan Drug Designation for bupivacaine for relief of persistent pain associated with PHN, such that if ELADUR is the first bupivacaine product approved for PHN, ELADUR should be eligible to receive seven years of data exclusivity following its approval by the FDA. There can be no assurance that ELADUR will be the first bupivacaine product approved for PHN, and therefore ELADUR may not be entitled to the seven year data exclusivity period for orphan drugs. Effective October 2008, we licensed the worldwide development and commercialization rights for ELADUR to Alpharma Ireland Limited (Alpharma), which was acquired by King in December 2008. In February 2011, Pfizer acquired King and thereby assumed the rights and obligations of King with respect to ELADUR. In February 2012, Pfizer gave notice that its rights with respect to ELADUR were being returned to us. In January 2014, we and Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax) entered into a definitive agreement (the Impax Agreement) pursuant to which we have granted Impax an exclusive worldwide license to our proprietary TRANSDUR transdermal delivery technology and other intellectual property to develop and commercialize ELADUR, in addition to selling certain assets and rights in and related to the product. Impax will control and fund the development and commercialization programs, and the parties established a joint management committee to oversee, review and coordinate the development and commercialization activities of the parties under the Impax Agreement.
 Clinical Program.    In 2007, we reported positive results from a 60 patient Phase 2a clinical trial for ELADUR. In this study of patients suffering from PHN, ELADUR showed improved pain control versus placebo during the 3-day continuous treatment period. In addition, ELADUR appeared well tolerated overall, and patients treated with ELADUR and placebo exhibited similar safety profiles. After acquiring Alpharma, King altered the clinical and regulatory strategy for further development of this program to prioritize chronic low back pain. We reported top line data from a Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by King for ELADUR in April 2011. In this study of 263 patients suffering from chronic low back pain, the primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating a positive treatment difference for the mean change in pain intensity scores from baseline to the mean of weeks 11 and 12 between ELADUR as compared to placebo was not met. Commencing in January 2014, Impax is now in charge of the future development program for ELADUR.
Relday
 Market Opportunity.    Risperidone is one of the most widely prescribed medications used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in adults and teenagers 13 years of age and older. Relday is being developed to address unmet clinical needs in this large patient population. An existing long-acting injectable risperidone product, which achieved global net sales of approximately $893 million in 2016, requires twice monthly, intramuscular injections and drug reconstitution prior to use. We and Zogenix expect that, if approved, Relday may be the first once-monthly, subcutaneous antipsychotic product that may offer an improved pharmacokinetic profile, significant reduction in injection volume and a simplified dosing regimen. We and Zogenix also expect that, if approved, Relday will provide a new long-acting treatment option for patients that currently use daily oral antipsychotic products.
 Development Strategy.    Under the development and license agreement entered into in July 2011 after working together since October 2007 under a feasibility agreement, Zogenix will be responsible for the clinical 
 12

development and commercialization of a proprietary, long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone using our SABER controlled-release formulation technology. We will share non-clinical development responsibilities. In January 2013, Zogenix reported positive single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) results from a Phase 1 clinical trial of Relday. According to Zogenix, adverse events in the Phase 1 trial in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were generally mild to moderate and consistent with other risperidone products. The Phase 1 clinical trial for Relday was conducted as a single-center, open-label, safety and PK trial of 30 patients with chronic, stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Per Zogenix, based on the favorable safety and PK profile demonstrated with the 25 mg and 50 mg once-monthly doses tested in the Phase 1 trial, Zogenix extended the study to include a 100 mg dose of the same formulation. In May 2013, Zogenix announced positive results with the 100 mg arm, demonstrating dose proportionality across the full dose range that would be anticipated to be used in clinical practice. In March 2015, Zogenix commenced a Phase 1b multi-dose parallel clinical trial, enrolling 60 subjects, for which Zogenix announced positive top line results in September 2015. According to Zogenix, the results for Relday demonstrated that risperidone plasma concentrations in the therapeutic range were achieved on the first day of dosing, reached steady state levels following the second dose and consistently maintained therapeutic levels throughout the four-month period. Also according to Zogenix, Relday was generally safe and well-tolerated, with results consistent with the profile of risperidone and the previous Phase 1 single-dose clinical trial. Zogenix further stated that it has initiated efforts to secure a development and commercialization partner for Relday, and that Relday is well-positioned to begin a Phase 3 program once a partner is secured.
 Additional ORADUR-Opioid Products
 Since 2006, we also worked with Pain Therapeutics on the development of three additional ORADUR abuse-resistant opioid drug candidates which would address the chronic pain market. Phase 1 clinical trials have been conducted for two of these ORADUR-based products (hydrocodone and hydromorphone), and an IND has been accepted by the FDA for the fourth ORADUR-based opioid (oxymorphone). In October 2013, Pain Therapeutics stated that it had regained all rights from Pfizer with respect to the three other ORADUR-based opioid drug candidates (hydrocodone, hydromorphone and oxymorphone). In 2015, Pain Therapeutics returned to us all of Pain Therapeutics’ rights and was relieved of its obligations under our license agreement to develop and commercialize ORADUR-based formulations of hydrocodone but without impacting the rights and obligations of the two parties with respect to REMOXY ER (oxycodone), hydromorphone and oxymorphone. In 2016, Pain Therapeutics returned to us all of Pain Therapeutics’ rights and was relieved of its obligations under our license agreement to develop and commercialize ORADUR-based formulations of hydromorphone and oxymorphone but without impacting the rights and obligations of the two parties with respect to REMOXY ER (oxycodone).
Depot Injectable Programs
 In addition to biologic drugs, many traditional small molecule drugs have to be given by frequent injections, which is costly, inconvenient and may result in either unwanted side effects or suboptimal efficacy. We have active programs underway to improve our depot injectable systems and to apply those systems to various drugs and drug candidates, and have entered into a number of feasibility studies with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to test their products in our systems. The Relday program with Zogenix and the ophthalmic program with Santen are two projects which started as depot injectable feasibility projects and then matured into development and license agreements.
Research Programs in other Therapeutic Categories
 We have underway a number of research programs covering medical diseases and conditions other than pain. Such programs include various diseases and disorders of the central nervous system, cardiovascular disease, ophthalmic conditions and metabolic disorders. In conducting our research programs and determining which particular efforts to prioritize for formal development, we employ a rigorous opportunity assessment process that takes into account the unmet medical need, commercial opportunity, technical feasibility, clinical viability, intellectual property considerations, and the development path including costs to achieve various critical milestones.

DURECT Strategy
 Our objective is to develop multiple pharmaceutical products that address significant unmet medical needs and improve patients’ quality of life. To achieve this objective, our strategy includes the following key elements:
 Apply our Drug Development Expertise to New Chemical Entities Derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program.    We have assembled a core team of employees with considerable experience in drug development, and it is our intent to leverage their capabilities by developing pharmaceuticals derived from our Epigenetic Regulator Program. We believe that these new chemical entities may have utility for several metabolic diseases such as NAFLD, NASH and other liver conditions, in acute organ injuries such as acute kidney injury, in various orphan diseases, and in inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis. We believe that these product candidates may be of interest to larger pharmaceutical companies and that it may be possible to license the rights to certain products, formulations, indications or territories from this program while retaining the rights to other product candidates, formulations, indications or territories for either our own development and commercialization or for licensing at a later stage of development.
 Focus on Chronic Debilitating Medical Conditions, Certain Local Pain Conditions and Certain Acute Indications.    Many of the diseases and disorders that present great challenges to medicine include pain management, CNS disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, acute organ injury, ophthalmic conditions and other chronic diseases. In addition, we have identified certain local and acute pain and other medical conditions that we believe can be addressed by improved therapeutics. Our current efforts focus on using our versatile drug delivery platform technologies to develop products that address these medical conditions and on exploiting our Epigenetic Regulator Program through which we have identified new chemical entities that may have utility in conditions such as acute organ injuries and chronic metabolic/lipid disorders.
 Diversify Risk by Pursuing Multiple Programs in Development.    In order to reduce the risks inherent in pharmaceutical product development, we have diversified our product pipeline such that, between our own programs and those where we have collaborated, we presently have two programs for which New Drug Applications have been filed and Complete Response Letters have been received, and six different other programs in development, including three oral drug candidates, one transdermal patch candidate and two injectable drug candidates. We believe that having multiple programs in development helps mitigate the negative consequences to us of any setbacks or delays in any one of our programs.
 Enable Product Development Through Strategic Collaborations.    We believe that entering into selective collaborations with respect to our product development programs can enhance the success of our product development and commercialization, mitigate our risk and enable us to better manage our operating costs. Additionally, such collaborations enable us to leverage investment by our collaborators and reduce our net cash burn, while retaining significant economic rights.
 Enable the Development of Pharmaceutical Systems Based on Biotechnology and Other New Compounds.    We believe there is a significant opportunity for pharmaceutical systems to add value to therapeutic medicine by administering biologics, such as proteins and peptides. We believe our technologies will improve the specificity, potency, convenience and cost-effectiveness of proteins, peptides, and other newly discovered drugs. Our systems can enable these compounds to be effectively administered, thus allowing them to become viable medicines. We can address the stability and storage needs of these compounds through our advanced formulation technology and package them in a suitable pharmaceutical system for optimum delivery. Through continuous administration, the SABER and CLOUD technology platforms may eliminate or reduce the need for multiple injections of these drugs. In addition, through precise placement of our proprietary biodegradable drug formulations, proteins can be delivered to specific tissues for extended periods of time, thus ensuring that large molecule agents are present at the desired site of action and minimizing the potential for adverse side effects elsewhere in the body.
 Build Our Own Commercial Organization.    In the future, we may elect to build our own commercial, sales and marketing capability in order to capture more of the economic value of certain products that we may develop. If we choose to enter into third-party collaborations to commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates, we may in the future enter into these alliances under circumstances that allow us to participate in the sales and marketing of these products.
 14

License Agreements
 We have entered into an exclusive in-license and research and development agreement with the Virginia Commonwealth University Intellectual Property Foundation regarding the new chemical entities under development through our Epigenetic Regulator Program, including DUR-928. Under this licensing arrangement, we have agreed to undertake certain efforts to bring licensed products to market, prosecute related patents and report on progress to VCU. In addition, we are obligated to pay low single-digit percentage patent royalties on net sales of licensed products, subject to annual minimum payments and additional milestone payments. This license includes rights to eight patent families. We may terminate this agreement at any time by written notice, and Virginia Commonwealth University may terminate this agreement by written notice if there is an uncured material breach.
 Third-Party Collaborations
 We have entered into the following agreements in connection with our third party collaborations:
 Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.    On December 11, 2014, we and Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Santen”) entered into a definitive agreement (the Santen Agreement). Pursuant to the Santen Agreement, we have granted Santen an exclusive worldwide license to our proprietary SABER formulation platform and other intellectual property to develop and commercialize a sustained release product utilizing our SABER technology to deliver an ophthalmology drug. Santen will control and fund the development and commercialization program, and the parties will establish a joint management committee to oversee, review and coordinate the development activities of the parties under the Agreement.
 In connection with the license agreement, Santen paid us an upfront fee of $2.0 million in cash and agreed to make contingent cash payments to us of up to $76.0 million upon the achievement of certain milestones, of which $13.0 million are development-based milestones (none of which has been achieved as of December 31, 2016), and $63.0 million are commercialization-based milestones including milestones requiring the achievement of certain product sales targets (none of which has been achieved as of December 31, 2016). Santen will also pay for certain of our costs incurred in the development of the licensed product. If the product is commercialized, we would also receive a tiered royalty on annual net product sales ranging from single-digit to the low double digits, determined on a country-by-country basis. Santen may terminate the Santen Agreement without cause at any time upon prior written notice, and either party may terminate the Santen Agreement upon certain circumstances including a material uncured breach. As of December 31, 2016, the cumulative aggregate payments received by us under this agreement were $3.3 million.
 Impax Laboratories, Inc.    On January 3, 2014, we and Impax entered into the definitive Impax Agreement. Pursuant to the Impax Agreement, we have granted Impax an exclusive worldwide license to our proprietary TRANSDUR transdermal delivery technology and other intellectual property to develop and commercialize ELADUR, our investigational transdermal bupivacaine patch for the treatment of pain associated with PHN, in addition to selling certain assets and rights in and related to the product. Impax will control and fund the development and commercialization programs, and the parties will establish a joint management committee to oversee, review and coordinate the development and commercialization activities of the parties under the Impax Agreement. Impax will reimburse us for certain future research and development we may be requested to conduct on the product.
 In connection with the Impax Agreement, Impax paid us an upfront fee of $2.0 million in cash and agreed to make contingent cash payments to us of up to $61.0 million payable based upon the achievement of predefined milestones, of which $31.0 million are development-based milestones and $30.0 million are commercialization-based milestones. Upon the first commercialization of ELADUR by Impax, we would also receive a tiered mid single-digit to low double-digit royalty on annual net product sales determined on a country-by-country basis. Impax is also required to pay to us a percentage of fees received in connection with any sublicense of the licensed rights. Impax may terminate the Impax Agreement without cause at any time upon prior written notice, and either party may terminate the Impax Agreement upon certain circumstances including written notice of a material uncured breach. As of December 31, 2016, the cumulative aggregate payments received by us under this agreement were $2.1 million.
 15

Zogenix, Inc.    On July 11, 2011, we and Zogenix, Inc., (Zogenix), entered into a Development and License Agreement (the Zogenix Agreement). We and Zogenix had previously been working together under a feasibility agreement pursuant to which our research and development costs were reimbursed by Zogenix. Under the Zogenix Agreement, Zogenix is responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of a proprietary, long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone using our SABER and other controlled-release depot formulation technologies. We are responsible for non-clinical, formulation and CMC development activities. We will be reimbursed by Zogenix for our research and development efforts on the product. Zogenix paid a non-refundable upfront fee to us of $2.25 million in July 2011. Zogenix is obligated to pay us up to $103 million in total future milestone payments with respect to the product subject to and upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and sales milestones. Of these potential milestones, $28 million are development-based milestones (none of which has been achieved as of December 31, 2016) and $75 million are sales-based milestones (none of which has been achieved as of December 31, 2016). Zogenix is also required to pay a mid single-digit to low double-digit percentage patent royalty on annual net sales of the product determined on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.
 We granted to Zogenix an exclusive worldwide license, with sub-license rights, to the intellectual property rights related to the proprietary polymeric and non-polymeric controlled-release formulation technology to make and have made, use, offer for sale, sell and import risperidone products, where risperidone is the sole active agent, for administration by injection in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other psychiatric related disorders in humans. We retain the right to supply Zogenix’s Phase 3 clinical trial and commercial product requirements on the terms set forth in the Zogenix Agreement. We retain the right to terminate the Zogenix Agreement with respect to specific countries if Zogenix fails to advance the development of the product in such country, either directly or through a sublicensee. In addition, either party may terminate the Zogenix Agreement upon insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party, upon written notice of a material uncured breach or if the other party takes any act impairing such other party’s relevant intellectual property rights. Zogenix may terminate the Zogenix Agreement upon written notice if during the development or commercialization of the product, the product becomes subject to one or more serious adverse drug experiences or if either party receives notice from a regulatory authority, independent review committee, data safety monitoring board or other similar body alleging significant concern regarding a patient safety issue. Zogenix may also terminate the Zogenix Agreement with or without cause, at any time upon prior written notice. As of December 31, 2016, the cumulative aggregate payments received by us under this agreement and the prior feasibility agreement were $20.1 million.
 Pain Therapeutics, Inc.    In December 2002, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Pain Therapeutics to develop and commercialize on a worldwide basis oral sustained release, abuse deterrent opioid products incorporating four specified opioid drugs using our ORADUR technology. The agreement also provides Pain Therapeutics with the exclusive right to commercialize products developed under the agreement on a worldwide basis. In connection with the execution of the agreement, Pain Therapeutics paid us an upfront fee. In November 2005, Pain Therapeutics sublicensed the worldwide commercialization rights (except for Australia and New Zealand) to certain products developed under the agreement (including REMOXY ER) to King. In February 2011 Pfizer acquired King and thereby assumed the rights and obligations of King with respect to the sublicense agreement. In December 2005, we amended our agreement with Pain Therapeutics in order to specify our obligations with respect to the supply of key excipients for use in the licensed products. Under the amended agreement, we are responsible for formulation development, supply of selected key excipients used in the manufacture of licensed product and other specified tasks. We receive reimbursement for our research and development efforts on the licensed products and a manufacturing profit on our supply of key product excipients to Pain Therapeutics for use in the licensed products. In 2015, Pain Therapeutics returned to us all of Pain Therapeutics’ rights and was relieved of its obligations under our license agreement to develop and commercialize ORADUR-based formulations of hydrocodone but without impacting the rights and obligations of the two parties with respect to REMOXY ER, hydromorphone and oxymorphone. In 2016, Pain Therapeutics returned to us all of Pain Therapeutics’ rights and was relieved of its obligations under our license agreement to develop and commercialize ORADUR-based formulations of hydromorphone and oxymorphone but without impacting the rights and obligations of the two parties with respect to REMOXY ER. Under the agreement with Pain Therapeutics, subject to and upon the achievement of predetermined development and regulatory milestones REMOXY ER, we are entitled to receive milestone payments of up to $3.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2016, we had received $1.5 million in cumulative milestone payments. In addition, if commercialized, we will receive royalties for REMOXY ER of between 6.0% to 11.5% of net sales of the product depending on the sales volumes. This agreement can be terminated by either party for material breach by the other party and by Pain Therapeutics without 
 16

cause. As of December 31, 2016, the cumulative aggregate payments received by us from Pain Therapeutics under this agreement were $40.3 million.
 In addition, in 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recognized $653,000, $96,000 and $33,000 of product revenue, respectively, related to key excipients for REMOXY ER and the associated cost of goods sold was $216,000, $51,000 and zero, respectively.
 Commercial Product Lines
 ALZET
 The ALZET product line consists of miniature, implantable osmotic pumps and accessories used for experimental research in mice, rats and other laboratory animals. These pumps are neither approved nor intended for human use. ALZET pumps continuously deliver drugs, hormones and other test agents at controlled rates from one day to six weeks without the need for external connections, frequent handling or repeated dosing. In laboratory research, these infusion pumps can be used for systemic administration when implanted under the skin or in the body. They can be attached to a catheter for intravenous, intracerebral, or intra-arterial infusion or for targeted delivery, where the effects of a drug or test agent are localized in a particular tissue or organ. The wide use and applications of the ALZET product line is evidenced by the more than 16,000 scientific references that now exist.
 We acquired the ALZET product line and assets used primarily in the manufacture, sale and distribution of this product line from ALZA in April 2000. We believe that the ALZET product line provides us with innovative design and application opportunities for potential new products.
 LACTEL Absorbable Polymers
 We currently design, develop and manufacture a wide range of standard and custom biodegradable polymers based on lactide, glycolide and caprolactone under the LACTEL brand for pharmaceutical and medical device clients for use as raw materials in their products. These materials are manufactured and sold by us directly from our facility in Alabama and are used by us and our third-party customers for a variety of controlled-release and medical-device applications, including several FDA-approved commercial products.
Marketing and Sales
 Historically, we have established strategic distribution and marketing alliances for our product candidates to leverage the established sales organizations that certain pharmaceutical companies have in markets we are targeting. In the future, we may elect to build our own commercial, sales and marketing capability in order to capture more of the economic value of certain products that we may develop. If we choose to enter into third-party collaborations to commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates, we may in the future enter into these alliances under circumstances that allow us to participate in the sales and marketing of these products. We will continue to pursue strategic alliances and collaborators from time to time consistent with our strategy to leverage the established sales organizations of third-party collaborators to achieve greater market penetration for some of our products than we could on our own. 
 We market and sell our ALZET and LACTEL product lines through a direct sales force in the U.S. and through a network of distributors outside of the U.S.
 Suppliers
 We purchase sucrose acetate isobutyrate, a raw material for our ORADUR and SABER-based pharmaceutical systems, including POSIMIR, REMOXY ER and other ORADUR-based drug candidates, pursuant to a supply agreement with Eastman Chemical Company. Our supply agreement with Eastman Chemical Company requires us to purchase a certain portion of our requirements for sucrose acetate isobutyrate from Eastman Chemical and obligates us to pay a fee per annum if our purchases do not meet specified sales targets. The agreement may be terminated by either party under certain circumstances, including any material uncured breach by, or the insolvency, liquidation or bankruptcy of, or similar proceedings involving, the other party. We believe that this agreement will 
 17

provide a sufficient supply of these raw materials to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical product candidates, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
 Customers
 Our product revenues principally are derived from the sale of the ALZET product line to academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers, the LACTEL product lines to pharmaceutical and medical device customers, and from the sale of certain key excipients that are included in REMOXY ER and other products. Until such time that we are able to bring our pharmaceutical product candidates to market, if at all, we expect these to be our principal sources of product revenue. We also receive revenue from collaborative research and development arrangements with our third-party collaborators. In 2016, Tolmar Inc. accounted for 15% of the Company’s total revenues. In 2015, Zogenix and Tolmar Inc. accounted for 26% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. In 2014, Zogenix and Impax accounted for 23% and 11% of our total revenues, respectively.
Manufacturing
 The process for manufacturing our pharmaceutical product candidates is technically complex, requires special skills, and must be performed in a qualified facility. We have entered into development and commercial manufacturing agreements with third parties for the manufacture of POSIMIR and DUR-928. In addition, we have a small multi-discipline manufacturing facility in California that we have used to manufacture research and clinical supplies of several of our pharmaceutical product candidates under GMP, including POSIMIR, REMOXY ER, and ELADUR. In the future, we intend to develop additional manufacturing capabilities for our pharmaceutical product candidates and components to meet our demands and those of our third party collaborators by contracting with third party manufacturers and by potentially constructing additional manufacturing space at our current facilities in California and Alabama. We manufacture our ALZET product line and certain key components for REMOXY ER at one of our California facilities and our LACTEL product line at our Alabama facility.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents, to protect trade secrets, to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. As of March 9, 2017, we owned or exclusively in-licensed over 60 unexpired issued U.S. patents and over 370 unexpired issued foreign patents (which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various EU member states). In addition, we have over 35 pending U.S. patent applications and over 100 foreign applications pending in Europe, Australia, Japan, Canada and other countries.
 Proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents owned by or licensed to us may not afford protection against competitors, and our pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by or licensed to us may not result in patents being issued. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, their enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Our patents or patent applications, or those licensed to us, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of 
 18

the patent, which could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and, consequently, our operating results and financial position.
 Because patent applications in the U.S. are typically maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after filing and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for protection of inventions set forth in such patent applications.
 Our planned or potential products may be covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, in which case we would need to obtain a license to continue developing or marketing these products. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain any required licenses, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design around these patents, or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed. Litigation may be necessary to defend against or assert such claims of infringement, to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. In addition, interference, derivation, post-grant oppositions, and similar proceedings may be necessary to determine rights to inventions in our patents and patent applications. Litigation or similar proceedings could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These efforts by us may not be successful.
 We may rely, in certain circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain contractors. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Government Regulation
 The Food and Drug Administration.    The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. We believe that our initial pharmaceutical systems will be regulated as drugs by the FDA rather than as biologics or devices.
 The process required by the FDA under the new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the Act) before our initial pharmaceutical systems may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical in our intended use; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of a new drug application.
--+----------------------------------------

 Section 505 of the Act describes three types of new drug applications: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (section 505(b)(1)); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference (section 505(b)(2)); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (section 505(j)). A supplement to an application 
 19

is a new drug application. We expect that most of the Drug Delivery Program product candidates will be approved by submission of a new drug application under section 505(b)(2) and that our drug candidates deriving from our Epigenetic Regulator Program will be approved by submission of a new drug application under section 505(b)(1).
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Even though several of our pharmaceutical systems utilize active drug ingredients that are commercially marketed in the United States in other dosage forms, we need to establish safety and effectiveness of those active ingredients in the formulation and dosage forms that we are developing.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical system. We then submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may begin human clinical trials. Each subsequent new clinical protocol must also be submitted to the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board at each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical study as well as the related informed consent forms and authorization forms that permit us to use individually identifiable health information of study participants.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: When Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population, at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical study sites. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the case of products for severe diseases, such as chronic pain, or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with disease rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target disease or condition, these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 trials, and thus these trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1/2 clinical trials. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials of our pharmaceutical systems within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the Institutional Review Board or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. During the clinical development of products, sponsors frequently meet and consult with the FDA in order to ensure that the design of their studies will likely provide data both sufficient and relevant for later regulatory approval; however, no assurance of approvability can be given by the FDA.
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of a new drug application, or NDA, for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the product. Submission of an NDA requires the payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and although the agency has defined user fee goals for the time in which to respond to sponsor applications, we cannot assure you that the FDA will act in any particular timeframe. The FDA may deny a new drug application if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data. Even if such data is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the new drug application does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. Requirements for additional Phase 4 studies (post approval marketing studies) to confirm safety and 
 20

effectiveness in a broader commercial use population may be imposed as a condition of marketing approval. In addition, the FDA requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products which have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to require changes in labeling or to prevent further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Any comparative claims that we would like to make for our products vis-à-vis other dosage forms or products will need to be substantiated generally by two adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials.
 Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for any of our pharmaceutical systems under development on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Evolving safety concerns can result in the imposition of new requirements for expensive and time consuming tests, such as for QT interval cardiotoxicity testing. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any pharmaceutical systems that we may develop and obtain approval for would also be subject to adverse findings of the active drug ingredients being marketed in different dosage forms and formulations. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business. Marketing our pharmaceutical systems abroad will require similar regulatory approvals and is subject to similar risks. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 Any pharmaceutical systems manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with good manufacturing practices, which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the GMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.
 The FDA regulates drug labeling and promotion activities. The FDA has actively enforced regulations prohibiting the marketing of products for unapproved uses, and federal and state authorities are also actively litigating against sponsors who promote their drugs for unapproved uses under various fraud and abuse and false claims act statutes. We and our pharmaceutical systems are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our pharmaceutical systems are or will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our pharmaceutical systems in those states or localities. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
 The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our potential pharmaceutical systems. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 For several years, the FDA has required companies engaged in manufacturing and sale of opioid drug products to have a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure that the benefits of the drugs continue to outweigh the risks. The affected opioid drugs include brand name and generic products and are formulated with the active ingredients fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. 
 21

All manufacturers of long-acting and extended-release opioids must ensure that training is provided to prescribers of these medications and develop information that prescribers can use when counseling patients about the risks and benefits of opioid use. 
 More recently, in February 2016, the FDA announced a comprehensive action plan to take concrete steps towards reducing the impact of opioid abuse on American families and communities. As part of this plan, the agency will review product and labelling decisions and re-examine the risk-benefit paradigm for opioids.
 Many of our drug candidates including REMOXY ER and our other ORADUR-based opioid drug candidates are subject to the REMS requirement. Until the contours of required REMS programs are established by the FDA and understood by drug developers and marketers such as ourselves and our collaborators, and until the results of the FDA’s recently announced initiatives are known, there may be delays in marketing approvals for these drug candidates. In addition, there may be increased cost, administrative burden and potential liability associated with the marketing and sale of these types of drug candidates subject to the REMS requirement, which could negatively impact the commercial benefits to us and our collaborators from the sale of these drug candidates.
 The Drug Enforcement Administration.    The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulates chemical compounds as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. Certain active ingredients in REMOXY and our other ORADUR-based opioid drug candidates, are listed by the DEA as Schedule II under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Consequently, their manufacture, research, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of oversight and regulation. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Furthermore, the amount of Schedule II substances we can obtain for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the DEA and our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials or meet commercial demand. There is a risk that DEA regulations may interfere with the supply of the drugs used in our clinical trials, and, in the future, our ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand, which could negatively impact us and our collaborators.
Competition
 We may face competition from other companies in numerous industries including pharmaceuticals, medical devices and drug delivery. POSIMIR, ELADUR, Relday, REMOXY ER and other ORADUR-based drug candidates, if approved, will compete with currently marketed oral opioids, transdermal opioids, local anesthetic patches, anti-psychotics, stimulants, implantable and external infusion pumps which can be used for infusion of opioids and local anesthetics. Products of these types are marketed by Purdue Pharma, AbbVie, Janssen, Medtronic, Endo, AstraZeneca, Pernix Therapeutics, Tricumed, Halyard Health, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Pacira, Acorda Therapeutics, Mallinckrodt, Shire, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Novartis, Egalet and others. Purdue Pharma, Sandoz, Actavis, Collegium Pharmaceutical, Pfizer, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Intellipharmaceutics, Egalet, Charleston Laboratories, Daiichi Sankyo,Teva Pharmaceuticals and others have also announced regulatory approval or development plans for abuse deterrent opioid products. Our ORADUR-ADHD product candidates, if approved, will compete with currently marketed or approved products by Shire, Johnson & Johnson, UCB, Novartis, Noven, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and others. Relday, if approved, will compete with currently marketed products by Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Astra Zeneca, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Otsuka, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Teva and others. Competition for DUR-928, if approved, will depend on the specific indications for which DUR-928 is approved. Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Gilead, Shire, Conatus Pharmaceuticals, Allergan, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit, Pfizer, Roche, Galmed Pharmaceuticals, Tobira Therapeutics, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk, Takeda, Vital Therapies and others have development plans for products to treat NAFLD/NASH and other liver diseases. Ischemix, Thrasos Therapeutics, AM-Pharma, Complexa, AbbVie, AlloCure, Quark Pharmaceuticals and others have development plans for products to treat acute kidney injury. Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Almirall, LEO Pharma, Pfizer, Janssen, Abbvie, Boerhinger-Ingelheim, Amgen, Sandoz, Astra-Zeneca, Anacor, Valeant, Takeda, Merck, Idera Pharmaceuticals and others have development plans for products to treat psoriasis. Numerous companies are applying significant resources and expertise to the problems of drug delivery and several of these are focusing or may focus on delivery of drugs to the intended site of action, including Alkermes, Pacira, Immune Pharmaceuticals, Innocoll, Nektar, Kimberly-Clark, Acorda Therapeutics, Flamel, Alexza, Mallinckrodt, Hospira, Pfizer, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Egalet, Acura, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Phosphagenics, 
 22

Intellipharmaceutics, Collegium Pharmaceutical, Heron Therapeutics and others. Some of these competitors may be addressing the same therapeutic areas or indications as we are. Our current and potential competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection or commercializing products before us. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. Acquisitions of, or investments in, competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors’ financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources.
 Any products we develop using our pharmaceutical systems technologies will compete in highly competitive markets. Many of our potential competitors in these markets have greater development, financial, manufacturing, marketing, and sales resources than we do and we cannot be certain that they will not succeed in developing products or technologies which will render our technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, many of those potential competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in their respective fields.
