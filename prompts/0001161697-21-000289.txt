ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview

Robotic Assistance Devices, LLC was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 26, 2016, as an LLC and was founded by current President Steve Reinharz. Mr. Reinharz, has 25+ years in various leadership/ownership roles in the security industry and was part of a successful exit to a global multinational security company in 2004. Mr. Reinharz started his first security integration company in 1996, which he grew to 30+ employees before closing that company in 2003. In 2017, Robotic Assistance Devices LLC converted to a C Corporation, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (“RAD”), through the issuance of 10,000 common shares to its sole shareholder.

Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions Inc. (formerly known as On the Move Systems Corp.) (“AITX” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Florida on March 25, 2010, and reincorporated in Nevada on February 17, 2015. On August 24, 2018, On the Move Systems Corp. changed its name to Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions Inc. (“AITX”). 

In 2017, AITX acquired all the ownership and equity interests in RAD (the “Acquisition”). Before the Acquisition, AITX’s business focus had been transportation services, and AITX was exploring the on-demand logistics market by developing a network of logistics partnerships. After the Acquisition, AITX shifted its business focus to align with RAD’s mission. Since that time, AITX has been engaged in pursuing the delivery of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic solutions for operational, security, and monitoring needs. More specifically, the Company is focused on applying advanced AI-driven technologies, paired with multi-use hardware and supported by custom software and cloud services, to intelligently automate and integrate a variety of high-frequency security, concierge, and operational tasks.

Since substantially all of AITX’s operations were disposed of with the transaction’s consummation, the Acquisition was treated as a reverse recapitalization effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes. AITX recorded no goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of the Acquisition. RAD is treated as the accounting acquirer as its stockholders control the Company after the Acquisition, even though AITX was the legal acquirer. Therefore, the assets, liabilities, and historical operations reflected in these financial statements are those of RAD as if RAD had always been the reporting company.

RAD’s solutions are offered as a recurring monthly subscription, typically with a minimum 12-month subscription contract. RAD’s solutions are expected to earn over 75% gross margin over the life of each deployed asset when under subscription. RAD also sells units which generally limits gross margin to the 50% range. Specifically, RAD provides workflow automation solutions delivered through a system of hardware, software and cloud services. All elements of hardware and software design offered by RAD are 100% designed, developed and owned by RAD except for gunshot detection capabilities. EAGL Technologies supplies RAD with gunshot detection technical features through a dealer agreement.

Mission

AITX’s mission is to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to solve enterprise problems categorized as expensive, repetitive, difficult to staff, and outside of the core competencies of the client organization.

A short list of basic examples include:


1. | Typical security guard-related functions such as monitoring a parking lot during and after hours and responding appropriately. This scenario applies to perimeters, interior yard areas, and related similar environments.
2. | Integrated hardware/software with AI-driven responses, simulating and expanding on what legacy or manned solutions could perform. 
3. | Automation of common access control functions through technology utilizing facial recognition and machine vision, leapfrogging most legacy solutions in use today. 


RAD’s first industry focus is the more than $100 billion global security services market.1 RAD’s current goal is to disrupt and capture a significant portion of both the human security guard market (over $30 billion)2 and “physical security” (video surveillance, access control, visitor management, etc.) market (over $20 billion) through its innovative RAD solution ecosystem.

- 1 -

 RAD solutions are unique because they:


1. | Start with an AI-driven autonomous response utilizing cellular-optimized communications, while easily connecting to a human operator for a manned response, as needed. 
2. | Use unique hardware purpose-built by RAD for delivery of these solutions. Various form factors have been customized to deliver this new functionality. 
3. | Deliver services through RAD-developed software and cloud services, allowing enterprise IT groups to focus on core competencies instead of maintenance of complex video and security platforms.


AITX Subsidiaries

AITX owns and operates three (3) wholly-owned subsidiaries.


1. | Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD I) is the primary operating company of AITX. The company holds the dealer and end-user contracts, employs all US employees, operates the California and Michigan facilities, and is the primary industry-facing entity of AITX. RAD I owns all intellectual property related to RADSoC™, RAD Mobile SOC™, RADGuard™, and their core operating architecture. RAD I owns everything related to AITX’s line of stationary devices and their manufacturing. RAD I also implements and services the devices. 
2. | Robotic Assistance Devices Group, Inc. (RAD G) is RAD G is an AITX subsidiary, separate from RAD I and RAD M, created for the purposes of expected future sales through a channel that is incompatible and non-competitive with RAD I’s existing channel. RAD G is focused on the development of advanced software and electronics solutions and hopes to have a solution in the marketplace by the end of 2021. The Company expects that this first solution, which will be software-only, will be marketed through RAD I. Additional solutions under development are likely to have a direct go-to-market strategy that complements RAD I’s strategy. Development efforts for these entities are highly confidential and will remain so until marketable solutions are ready to launch. 
3. | Robotic Assistance Devices Mobile, Inc. (RAD M) is RAD M is an AITX subsidiary, separate from RAD I and RAD G, created for the purposes of future developments, partnerships, and marketing in which the Company may engage in the future. RAD M is focused on the development of autonomous mobile devices, both ground-based and airborne. RAD M’s first solution, the ROAMEO™ unmanned ground vehicle, incorporates RAD M technologies related to the development of custom chassis, drive train, power management, perception, and prediction. ROAMEO features technology from RAD I to perform its functions. The Company believes that ROAMEO will bring the first outdoor, rugged, commercial security and facility robot to market. This mobile solution will complement the stationary systems. ROAMEO is manufactured, implemented, and maintained by RAD I. ROAMEO will begin serial production in RAD’s Michigan facility in June or July 2021. RAD M will continue developing additional mobility solutions that RAD I will bring to market.

Background - First Commercial Rugged Outdoor Security Robot

Mr. Reinharz started RAD in the summer of 2016. RAD originally partnered with SMP Robotics Systems Corp. (SMP) and commercialized the SMP S5 Robot for the security market. RAD’s commercialization of the platform focused on integrating traditional security industry manufacturers’ solutions onto the robotics platform. After two paid proofs-of-concept for large utility companies (under NDA) and over 18 months of development and testing, RAD began deployments with various Fortune 500 customers. These deployments were scheduled to start in October 2017 but were delayed until December 2017 due to various supply chain challenges. 

By March 2018 it was apparent that S5 platform was not sustainable and RAD began to pull robots out of service.

The robots were rejected by customers due to unsatisfactory reliability and some technical flaws that could not be solved, despite full efforts by SMP and RAD. RAD now considers this phase of the company ‘Phase 1’ into robotics. The Company attempted over 40 deployments during this period.

RAD has had no contact with SMP Robotics since April 2018.

Much of RAD’s existing convertible debt was acquired in support of the RAD/SMP robotics program. This convertible debt has largely been converted to long-term debt and warrants as shown in these financial filings.

 ROAMEO will deliver on AITX’s goal of bringing the first outdoor, rugged, commercial security and facility robot to market. This mobile solution will complement the stationary systems AITX already has operating in physical security applications serving customers in a wide range of environments.

Background – RAD’s 2nd Generation Ecosystem

RAD’s primary strategy has always been to use AI technology and modern systems to transform the security industry. Mobile robots, indoor and outdoor, are a part of that strategy. However, to ultimately realize the delivery of these solutions, a set of “stationary robots” required development.

These stationary robots launched in April 2018 with the Security Control and Observation Tower (SCOT), development of which began in August 2017. SCOT performs many of the same functions as a stationary human security guard, plus many tasks that human guards cannot, and does so at approximately 15% of the cost. There is no known comparable solution available today that blends technology, usability, unique features, and price. SCOT received an enthusiastic response from the security market and industry accolades. SCOT’s positive reception reinvigorated RAD, which accelerated the development of the software and cloud services that support SCOT. SCOT runs on the RAD Software Suite™. This software suite is a cloud and mobile platform at the heart of all RAD security solutions.

A beta version SCOT was first shown to potential customers at the end of February 2018 in an exposition held in Ohio that tested customer reception and elicited voice-of-the-customer input. SCOT and the preliminary RAD Software Suite received a favorable customer response. Customer feedback was incorporated into SCOT, and ideas on SCOT derivatives were added to the hardware development roadmap.

In April 2018, at the ISC West, a large annual physical security event held in the United States, SCOT won three awards: (1) The Security Industry Association’s (SIA) New Product Award for Law Enforcement/Guarding3, (2) A 2018 Secure Campus Award from Campus Security and Life Safety Magazine, and (3) A ‘Govie’ award for government security solutions from Security Today Magazine.

RAD has not submitted entries for any awards since mid-2018 but expects future awards participation.

RAD’s pivot to SCOT and its future derivatives is complete, and RAD’s current facilities can produce a mix of up to 100 units per month with moderate additional investment in equipment and manpower.
Currently Available Hardware Solutions

RAD’s hardware lineup has improved and expanded since initial launch in April 2018. RAD’s hardware lineup includes:


1. | “SCOT 2.0” , which replaced SCOT 1.x. SCOT 1 was upgraded during the first year after its introduction and became SCOT 1.4., which features a mature software platform and a refined hardware platform. SCOT solutions have operated with over 99% uptime since inception. It SCOT 1.4 embodies and offers the full complement of solutions driven by the RAD Cloud. Scot 2.0 is a SCOT 1.4 enclosed in an appealing modern enclosure. It also features additional LCD monitors (like those used in the WALLY, described below), curved LED panels to support visibility, flexible messaging (as opposed to the flat LED panels used in SCOT 1.x), and an advanced locking system. SCOT 2.0 is the realization of the concepts pioneered, demonstrated, and tested throughout the 1.x series. The SCOT lineup is indoor/outdoor rated. 
2. | ‘WALLY’ was announced in June 2018 at the BOMA International Show in San Antonio, Texas. WALLY is a wall-mounted derivative of SCOT that is also indoor/outdoor rated. It is designed to bring the RAD ecosystem to entryways, elevator lobbies, loading docks, and other areas where wall mounting is preferable. WALLY has been upgraded several times since inception, with the current version being the “WALLY 2.1 HSO,” which includes a Health Screening Option. This feature automates temperature checks of workers and visitors entering a facility and simplifies contact tracing follow-up. RAD anticipates strong demand for this feature as COVID occupancy restrictions loosen and businesses struggle to efficiently process many more people entering their facilities.

3. | “AVA” was introduced by the Company in March 2020 and replaces “FRED,” which had been introduced in 2018 as a complement to the RAD ecosystem and focused exclusively on verified entry methods. AVA performs not only the tasks previously performed by FRED but also additional tasks. RAD delivered the first AVA unit in September 2020. [Mounted on gate stanchions and appropriate for office access.] 
4. | “ROSA” (Responsive Observation Security Agent) was introduced in 2019. In addition to providing surveillance capabilities, the unit has been designed to deter loitering, vandalism, and other criminal behaviors by autonomously responding to trespassers with escalating lights, sirens, and targeted messaging. Case studies of two successful installations have been shared widely among the security community and have received coverage in the trade press4. ‘ROSA180’ was announced in May 2021 and is the successor to ROSA. 
5. | “ROSA270” was announced in May 2021 and complements the existing RAD I stationary lineup. It offers an expanded 270° field of view. 

Software Solutions

RAD has created a variety of front-end and back-end software solutions to power its ecosystem. RADGUARD is customer-facing software (on the touchscreens of RAD’s field devices), and management solutions include RADSOC (Security Operations Center) and RADPMC (Property Management Center).

RAD has developed a variety of utilities that allow automatic over-the-air updates, most of which are within a back-end application called SCOT Manager.

RAD has developed Visitor Management, Access Control, and other applications itself instead of seeking to partner with legacy manufacturers. It is RAD’s opinion that the legacy paradigm in the physical space underserves the markets in terms of cost, functionality, and integration.

RAD recently introduced its own Video Management System into RADSOC, delivering a fully integrated solution that facilitates robust security and property management capabilities.

The Company believes that RAD’s ability to deliver easy-to-use, easy-to-obtain, and easy-to-support software, combined with custom workflow-automation applications, is key to the Company’s success.

Manufacturing & Assembly

RAD uses various domestic and overseas machine shops for raw material procurement and machining of the required plastic and metal pieces that build RAD devices. RAD’s sourcing has redundancy through use of multiple machine shops producing the same products for RAD. In addition, all pieces within any RAD device can be procured from a choice of suppliers.

RAD’s margins are based on current small batch production and assembly. The Company expects that economies of scale will drive greater gross margin as quantities and efficiencies increase.

Roadmap

RAD expects to introduce new products and updates to several products during the remainder of 2021 and early 2022, including the following:

1) ROAMEO 2.0 in June 2021. This release will significantly improve the robot’s perception, prediction, battery, speed, and autonomous charging. 

2) ROSA270 to be announced June 2021. This is a new solution.

3) ROSA180, the successor to last year’s ROSA.

4) Other hardware and software solutions, currently being developed, one of which is expected to be introduced in June 2021.

 RAD’s hardware and software have benefited from continuous significant improvements and to date has over 600,000 paid operating hours.

Team and Culture

AITX has built a strong start-up culture based on performance, sacrifice, and rewards. Attracting employees who can thrive in this environment requires a different approach to corporate growth and development. RAD’s governing philosophy centers around the principles of “Emotional Intelligence. Self-awareness, composure, internal motivation, empathy, and social skills are prerequisites for joining the RAD team, and each candidate interview begins with a review of the foundational elements that comprise RAD culture.

Team members are open to multitasking and wearing multiple hats, as situations demand. This allows management to focus on larger goals and long-term strategies. We try to ensure that our entire staff shares the same core beliefs and values as the Company, allowing us to adapt and adjust quickly to changes that might grind other companies to a halt. Members have been no stranger to the difficulties that face a startup, including unexpected setbacks, delays in funding, or a cash crunch, but they have persevered with dedication and enthusiasm for our greater mission. They have met incredibly tight deadlines, volunteered to make financial sacrifices, and assisted wherever and however they can.

We believe that RAD’s high-EQ work culture creates productive, motivated employees that has allowed the Company to weather the difficult period of robot deployments and our transition to 2nd generation solutions. 

Market Environment

RAD believes that its experience has shown that the security market is ripe for disruption. It has captured the interest of many Fortune 500 companies. The Company believes that no other company operating in the physical security space has the solutions, distribution channel, reputation, sales or support model to rival RAD in the near term. In addition, the Company expects that the launch of RAD’s mobile solutions will significantly increase the gap between it and would-be competitors. RAD will be a one-stop-shop for proven and comprehensive mobile and stationary workflow improvement devices and systems.

RAD’s technology model includes a “new paradigm” for the security industry: Security in a Box. Every RAD solution features connection to the RAD Software Suite, a platform for AI processing, usage analytics, cloud-sided video, communications interface, audit logs, and much more.

Positive market reception for RAD solutions is due to the following conditions:


1. | The security guard industry is characterized by poor customer satisfaction and industry consolidation. It’s self-described to be a “race to the bottom” to provide the lowest cost to end-users who require at least some level of security services for crime deterrence and insurance purposes. There are 1.1 million security guards in the United States and the security guard industry represents over $20 billion in annual sales. The average security guard hourly rate is $20 per hour. 
2. | Enterprise organizations’ security divisions/groups are continuously challenged to reduce cost. For example, Universal Parcel Service (UPS) spends over $120 million per year in security guard services, Lockheed Martin over $60 million per year, and NBC Universal over $25 million per/year. The security guard industry has not had any significant disruption or innovation since its inception. 
3. | Guard companies struggle to offer quality service at a reasonable price. Security organizations are eagerly receptive to solutions that improve performance and reduce cost. Guard companies are facing a worker shortage, to the point that they are turning away customers. There is a glut of low-wage jobs available, and compared to opportunities in the retail and service sector, guard positions are undesirable. The work is lonely and boring, and there is little or no room for career growth. Security companies have two alternatives; drastically increase hourly pay to attract more candidates, or automate their processes to require fewer workers who perform more interesting jobs. The former option is expected to increase the cost of services to the end-user; the latter option is expected to reduce the price while delivering security services that may equal or exceed the quality of services performed by individual guards. RAD is uniquely positioned to facilitate this second model, thereby helping to eliminate the staffing crisis for guard companies who embrace RAD’s solutions.
4. | RAD’s device rental model delivers significantly lower operating costs. With RAD’s current stationary solutions retailing from under $1/hour to $5/hour, customers immediately benefit from substantial savings and more comprehensive security. 


- 5 -

 
5. | RAD’s services options allow end-users to incorporate or fully replace their existing Security Operation Centers with RAD solutions. RAD’s “Solutions-As-A-Service” Rental Program offers customized options to help organizations achieve operational and security goals.


The above conditions speak to the historical lack of innovation in the guarding market. RAD upends this tradition by approaching security challenges through a truly revolutionary approach. The market is now positioned for major disruption with the application of AI-based solutions, as lead by RAD. As such, the interest in RAD solutions has been overwhelming. Major companies, including the largest U.S. guarding company, are aligning with RAD to offer these services to their customer base.

Prospective ROAMEO Impact

The Company’s release of ROAMEO positions it as a near-competitor to Knightscope, a Palo Alto based robotics company in business since 2012. RAD’s approach is different from Knightscope’s on many elements of technology. 

RAD expects that a small number of expected ROAMEO orders will make a substantial impact on RAD’s financial performance and create momentum for significant adoption of the entire RAD lineup.

Customer Acceptance of RAD Solutions

RAD end-users include one Fortune Top 10 company and a number of other Fortune 500 companies. RAD is currently deployed in logistics, commercial real estate, healthcare, and retail industries. The Company believes that if RAD is ultimately deployed to only 5% of the facilities within any of these industries, the Company will be profitable. 

RAD’s batch production of SCOTs & WALLYs have all been committed prior to the completion of the production cycle, with an average delivery time of 45 days. RAD has set a goal, predicated on steady demand, to reduce delivery time to 15 days.

RAD Industry Leadership Role

Mr. Reinharz has earned a prominent role as a spokesperson for AI and change in the security industry. He has lectured and participated in several panels for some of the security industry’s largest events and organizations. Mr. Reinharz sits on the SIA’s Autonomous Working Group committee, which is dedicated to helping shape the industry and support progressive legislation. Most recently, Mr. Reinharz provided a lecture to NYC’s ASIS CPP group that qualified as a continuing education credit.

It is expected that Mr. Reinharz will continue his promotion of the new paradigm for the next few years until adoption is widespread.

Go To Market Strategy

RAD’s strategy continues to focus on the creation and support of a strong dealer channel. This approach affords multiple benefits to RAD with few downsides. RAD has successfully integrated through the largest U.S. guarding company and recently signed another top-three guarding company as a RAD dealer. Furthermore, RAD has been signing up and developing mid-sized and smaller dealers. RAD is on track to establish a focused group of dealers, most of whom will exclusively represent RAD solutions. 

Supplemental to nurturing a solid dealer channel, RAD will, under certain circumstances, accept subscriptions directly from end-users. These situations are largely characterized by the end-user not having a guarding company, having a guarding company that RAD does not want as a dealer, or other extenuating circumstances. RAD has no desired ratio of dealer vs. direct subscriptions. Dealer subscriptions remain the primary focus. 

Competition

RAD has no direct competition save for one immediate competitor and one potential competitor.

RAD is considered part of the “drones” category of the security industry, although at RAD we consider ourselves to be in the workflow automation industry. 

- 6 -

 RAD deliberately restricts information that is public for three main reasons:


1. | Usually, activities are covered by mutual non-disclosure agreements and RAD generally will not ask for permission to publicize customer activities.
2. | These are generally security applications, and most companies prefer not to advertise the details of their security systems. 
3. | Until RAD hits the “tipping point,” we prefer to keep our solutions somewhat stealth so as not to give our would-be competitors ideas to copy. 


We anticipate that, eventually, some competition may enter the market. RAD seeks to maintain a 2+ year competitive advantage through a broad line of hardware solutions, the fastest and smoothest user interface, and the strongest feature set with the most mature back-end. Furthermore, RAD seeks to expand its sales staff and become the dominant incumbent in this new market that it has created.

Covid Impact

The company issued a Covid Impact notice on March 24, 2020 that can be found here:

https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.11/48b.407.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covidUpdate.pdf.

In summary, Covid accelerated some opportunities and sales while stunting others. Overall, the Company believes that the Covid pandemic will spur the use of innovative cost-saving technology like that created by RAD. Indeed, at the time of this writing, RAD is engaged in several large and high-level discussions with companies actively looking to reduce cost due to the pandemic. RAD expects this to remain a priority, even in light of vaccination availability and a reopening economy. Furthermore, the elimination of millions of low-wage jobs at the start of the pandemic and the current widespread competition to now replace those workers has exacerbated the already difficult challenge of attracting candidates for security guard positions. With the security industry facing a severe security guard shortage, RAD’s technology-based solutions are a desirable, affordable, and readily available alternative.
Employees

As of May 9, 2021, we have 50 employees, including full-time contract employees in California and Canada. None of our employees are represented by a union. We consider our employee relations to be excellent. AITX is rolling out its approved (April 2021 8-K) ESOP to all employees during the 2nd and 3rd quarters.

RAD Client Satisfaction – Documented via Case Studies

RAD has issued 2 formal case studies, published in their related industry trade publications. These document the verifiable contributions that the clients’ RAD units have made to enhance their property’s security profile, while reducing overall costs. Excerpts from the case studies include:

“Damage to vehicles, graffiti on the exterior of the building, the homeless tampering with our electrical outlets to charge their phones, trash left around the property – that’s all gone since we put the ROSAs in.” 

“We’re paying a fraction of what we were paying before and more importantly, we’ve seen a drop in crime. ROSA is doing the same or better than having a security guard in place.”

The future implementation of such case studies will advance RAD’s reach into new vertical markets. Published case studies include:


• | 3/15/2021 - Robotic Assistance Devices Published Case Study Regarding Security and Cost Savings at Client Citrus Construction
• | 4/6/2021 - Robotic Assistance Devices’ ROSA Proves Its Value in Automotive Applications
