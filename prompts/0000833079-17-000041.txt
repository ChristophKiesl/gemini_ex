Item 1. Business
The Company
Meritage Homes is a leading designer and builder of single-family homes. We primarily build in historically high-growth regions of the United States and offer a variety of homes that are designed to appeal to a wide range of homebuyers, including first-time, move-up, active adult and luxury. We have homebuilding operations in three regions: West, Central and East, which are comprised of nine states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. These three regions are our principal homebuilding reporting segments. We also operate a wholly-owned title company, Carefree Title Agency, Inc. ("Carefree Title"). Carefree Title's core business includes title insurance and closing/settlement services we offer to our homebuyers. Refer to Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating and reporting segments.
Our homebuilding and marketing activities are conducted under the name of Meritage Homes in each of our homebuilding markets. We also offer luxury homes in some markets under the name of Monterey Homes. At December 31, 2016, we were actively selling homes in 243 communities, with base prices ranging from approximately $162,000 to $1,440,000. Our average sales price on closings and orders were $408,400 and $411,700, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2016.
In the latter half of 2012, we commenced operations of our wholly-owned title company, Carefree Title. Carefree Title's core business lines include title insurance and closing/settlement services for our homebuyers in most of our markets. Managing our own title operations allows us greater control over the entire escrow and closing cycles in addition to generating additional revenue. In addition, we believe homebuyers that utilize Carefree Title's services for their home closings benefit from a more convenient closing experience as Carefree Title's processes are streamlined with those of our homebuilding operations, creating a more efficient work-flow that is seamless to our homebuyers. Revenue and expense from Carefree Title are included in our Financial Services segment in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Available Information; Corporate Governance
Meritage Homes Corporation was incorporated in 1988 as a real estate investment trust in the State of Maryland. On December 31, 1996, through a merger, we acquired the homebuilding operations of our predecessor company. We currently focus on homebuilding and related activities and no longer operate as a real estate investment trust. Meritage Homes Corporation operates as a holding company and has no independent assets or operations. Its homebuilding construction, development and sales activities are conducted through its subsidiaries.
Information about our company and communities is provided on our Internet website at www.meritagehomes.com. The information contained on our website is not considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our periodic and current reports, including any amendments, filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) are available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Meritage operates within a comprehensive plan of corporate governance for the purpose of defining responsibilities and setting high standards for ethical conduct. Our Board of Directors has established an audit committee, executive compensation committee, nominating/governance committee and land committee. The charters for each of these committees are available on our website, along with our Code of Ethics, Corporate Governance Principles and Practices, Conflict of Interest Policy and Securities Trading Policy. All of our employees, officers and directors, are required to comply with our Code of Ethics and to immediately report through the appropriate channels, any known instances of non-compliance.

Strategy
All facets of our operations are governed by our core values that define Meritage's culture and operational parameters, ensuring that our actions are aligned around the achievement of our core purpose of enriching lives by building the American dream and delivering to each of our customers a LIFE. BUILT. BETTER.™. These values combine our entrepreneurial spirit, cutting-edge innovation and organizational agility to strive for industry-leading results in all of our functional areas, including: 
3

management, land acquisition and development, finance, marketing, sales, purchasing, construction and customer care. The main tenets of our core values are to:


• | Continuously and purposefully renew, rethink and innovate to align our pricing, product and community offerings with homebuyers’ changing demands;


• | Be relentless in our pursuit of excellence by continuously improving our construction process; working with our vendors to find mutual efficiencies in order to construct high-quality homes at the lowest possible cost, while incorporating our energy-efficiency technologies and other innovative concepts into routine construction practices;


• | Provide the highest level of customer service and care by bringing passion and care to every customer interaction throughout the sales and construction process and after delivery of their homes; and


• | Ensure that we have the best team available through investing in our people and fostering an environment that embraces continual growth and learning and expecting top level performance.

These core values are evident in the operational decisions we make in each of our divisions and communities, all of which contribute to the successes we have achieved with our customers, within the marketplace and within our homebuilder peer group. 
With our focus on innovation, we employ industry-leading building techniques and technologies throughout Meritage aimed at setting the standard for energy-efficient homebuilding. Accordingly, at a minimum, every new home we construct (except those we construct in markets in which we enter through acquisition and are in the process of converting existing product), meets ENERGY STAR® standards, with many of our communities greatly surpassing those levels, offering our customers homes that utilize, on average, half of the energy of the standard US home. Our commitment to incorporate these energy standards into all of our homes has resulted in our achievement of design, purchasing and production efficiencies that have allowed us to offer these as standard features to our home buyers for nominal additional cost. As a result of our innovative building practices, we have benefited from energy tax credits over the past several years of approximately $41.4 million through December 31, 2016. 
Year after year, the homes we build help deliver short- and long-term savings to our homeowners. As a result, for the fourth consecutive year, we have earned the EPA's highest ENERGY STAR award, "Partner of the Year - Sustained Excellence". Because of our recognized industry leadership, utility companies and the US Department of Energy periodically partner with us to introduce advanced building technologies into the homes we build that further differentiate our product in the marketplace when compared against both new and resale homes. This financial backing provides us with a competitive advantage while allowing our buyers to live in more comfortable, healthy and cost-effective homes.
In 2014, we proudly issued our first Corporate Sustainability Report ("Sustainability Report"), voluntarily reporting our 2013 sustainability practices in compliance with the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines. A copy of our Sustainability Report is available on our website and we are currently working on our 2016 Sustainability Report which we plan to issue later in 2017.

Higher closing volume along with higher average sales prices contributed to a strong year of revenue growth in 2016, generating 18.6% higher home closing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. Delays in community openings during the year combined with faster-than-anticipated sellout of communities led to tempered orders in the latter part of the year and contributed to the slightly lower number of units in backlog at December 31, 2016. Land spending was lower in 2015 as we assessed uncertainties in specific markets, which contributed to opening delays and lower overall ending community count in 2016. We are strategically focused on land acquisition to grow community count and to that end we ended 2016 with 29,815 home sites controlled, a 7.3% increase compared to 2015. We believe our land positioning is poised to help us achieve further growth and profitability. 
Recent Industry and Company Developments 
The 2016 housing market generally experienced a steady level of growth, thanks in part to the continued low cost of home ownership and improving consumer confidence, contributing to a favorable demand environment, particularly in the first-time buyer segment. Despite the modest rise in interest rates in the last quarter of the year, rates are still historically low, and their impact has not yet been observed in the homebuilding industry.
In line with historical trends in the homebuilding industry, the performance of individual housing markets vary. Accordingly, we experienced healthy orders and average sales price growth in some markets and more tempered growth or slight declines in our year-over-year results in other markets. We remain focused on positioning ourselves in well-located and highly-desired communities in many of the top residential real-estate markets in the United States to continue to tap into the demand of today's homebuyers. We believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from our competition by offering a lineup of extremely livable and efficient plans that highlight the benefits of our industry-leading energy-efficient homes. In addition, we also offer our buyers the ability to personalize their homes and we provide a home warranty, further setting us apart from the competition we face with resale homes. 
We carefully manage our goals of maintaining adequate liquidity and a strong balance sheet. During 2016, we exercised the accordion feature on our unsecured revolving credit facility and increased the total commitments to $540.0 million and extended the maturity date whereby $60.0 million matures in 2019 with the remainder maturing in 2020. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $131.7 million as compared to $262.2 million at December 31, 2015, a year-over-year decline due mainly to increased real estate spending. Our net debt-to-capital ratio remained within our target of the low-to-mid 40% range at 41.2% at December 31, 2016, compared to 40.4% at December 31, 2015. As a means of managing our cash outlays, we seek to acquire lot positions through option contracts that allow us to leverage our balance sheet when both available and financially feasible (see Note 3 for additional information related to option contracts). We continue to reinforce our lot positions with well-located lots in our existing markets and are continually evaluating opportunities for expansion into new markets. We have entered six new markets since 2011 and most recently we entered the Atlanta, Georgia and Greenville, South Carolina markets in 2014 through acquisition of the assets of a regional homebuilder. 
Our active community count declined to 243 at year end versus 254 a year ago. Our orders per average active community during 2016 was relatively flat at 29.3 as compared to 29.4 in 2015. Our unsold inventory consisted of 1,692 homes as of December 31, 2016, approximately 28.9% of which were completed, as compared to prior year unsold inventory of 1,270 homes. The increase in unsold inventory primarily relates to our strategy to increase the availability of quick move-in home opportunities in our entry-level segment.
Land Acquisition and Development

Our current land pipeline goal is to maintain an approximate four-to-five year supply of lots, which we believe provides an appropriate planning horizon to address regulatory matters and land development and manage to our business plan for future closings. To grow our business and to better leverage our existing overhead, we are currently focused on adding to our current lot positions and expanding our market share in our key markets and their surrounding submarkets while also exploring opportunities outside of our existing markets, when available. As of December 31, 2016 we have a 4.1-year supply of lots, based on 2016 closings. We continually evaluate our markets, monitoring and adjusting our lot supplies through lot and land acquisitions to ensure we have a sufficient pipeline that is in sync with local market dynamics as well as our goals for growth in those markets.
We are currently purchasing primarily partially-developed or undeveloped lots. The opportunity to purchase substantially finished lots in desired locations is becoming increasingly more limited and competitive than in prior years. Finished lots are those on which the development has already been completed by a third party, and which are ready for immediate home construction. Undeveloped land and partially finished lots require a longer lead time to allow for development activities before our new communities are able to open for sales. However, we are typically purchasing undeveloped and partially finished lots at a lower cost as we are responsible for improvements on the land, rather than paying a mark-up on improvements from a prior developer. When evaluating any land acquisition, our selection is based upon a variety of factors, including:
7


• | financial feasibility of the proposed project, including projected profit margins, return on capital invested, and the capital payback period;


• | management’s judgment as to the local real estate market and economic trends, and our experience in particular markets;


• | suitability of the land to achieve desired shift in product mix toward entry-level product;


• | existing concentration of owned and contracted lots in surrounding markets, including nearby Meritage communities;


• | timeline for development, generally within a three to five-year time period from the beginning of the development process to the delivery of the last home;


• | surrounding demographics based on extensive marketing studies, including surveys of both new and resale homebuyers;


• | the ability to secure governmental approvals and entitlements, if required;


• | results of environmental and legal due diligence;


• | proximity to local traffic and employment corridors and amenities;


• | entitlement and development risks and timelines; and


• | availability of seller-provided purchase options or agreements that allow us to defer lot purchases until needed for production

When purchasing undeveloped or partially developed land, we prefer to acquire land only after most necessary entitlements have been obtained so that development or construction may begin as market conditions dictate. The term “entitlements” refers to appropriate zoning, development agreements and preliminary or tentative maps and recorded plats, depending on the jurisdiction within which the land is located. Entitlements generally give the developer the right to obtain building permits upon compliance with conditions that are ordinarily within the developer’s control. Even though entitlements are usually obtained before land is purchased, we are typically still required to secure a variety of other governmental approvals and permits prior to and during development, and the process of obtaining such approvals and permits can be lengthy. We may consider the purchase of unentitled property when we can do so in a manner consistent with our business strategy. Currently, we are purchasing and developing parcels that on average range from 50 to 200 lots. 
Once we secure undeveloped land, we generally supervise and control the development of the land through contractual agreements with subcontractors. These activities include site planning and engineering, as well as constructing road, sewer, water, utilities, drainage, landscaping improvements, and recreation facilities and other improvements and refinements. We may build homes in master-planned communities with home sites that are along or near major amenities, such as golf courses or recreation facilities.
The factors used to evaluate finished lot purchases are similar to those for land we intend to develop ourselves, although the development risks associated with the undeveloped land—financial, environmental, legal and governmental—have been borne by others. Therefore, these finished lots may be more attractive to us, despite their higher price, as we can immediately bring the community to market and begin home construction as well as mitigate potential cost and time risks that can occur during the land development cycle.
We develop a design and marketing concept tailored to each community, which includes the determination of size, style and price range of homes. We may also determine street layout, individual lot size and layout, and overall community design for each project we develop. The product lines offered depend upon many factors, including the guidelines, if any, of the existing community, housing generally available in the area, the needs and desired housing product for a particular market, and our lot sizes, though we are increasingly able to use standardized design plans across most of our communities.
As a means of accessing parcels of land with minimal cash outlay, we may use rolling option contracts. Acquiring our land through option contracts, when available, allows us to leverage our balance sheet by controlling the timing and volume of lot and land purchases from third parties. These contracts provide us the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy lots and are usually structured to approximate our projected absorption rate at the time the contract is negotiated. Lot option contracts are generally non-recourse and typically require the payment of non-refundable deposits of 5% to 20% of the total land purchase price. We believe the use of option contracts limits the market risks associated with land ownership by allowing us to re-negotiate option terms or terminate options in the event of declines in land value and/or market downturns. In the event we elect to cancel an option contract, our losses are typically limited to the forfeiture of our option deposits and any associated capitalized pre-acquisition costs. The cost of obtaining land through such option contracts is generally higher than if we were to purchase land in bulk, although historically the financial leverage they can provide has frequently outweighed the financing costs associated with them. However, during a period of gross margin contraction, we diligently analyze each option contract to ensure financial feasibility and will generally only contract for lots in this manner if we are still able to achieve desired margins. During 2016 we were successful in securing approximately 1,900 lots through such options. Land purchases are generally financed through our working capital, including corporate borrowings.
8

At December 31, 2016, in addition to our 19,380 owned lots, we also had 10,435 lots under purchase or option contracts for a total purchase price of approximately $696.6 million, with $79.7 million in cash deposits. We purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding operations, although we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders from time to time where we have excess land positions. Information related to lots and land under option is presented in Note 3—Variable Interest Entities and Consolidated Real Estate Not Owned in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
All land and lot acquisitions are reviewed by our corporate land acquisition committee, which is comprised of certain members of our executive management team and key operating executives. All land acquisitions exceeding pre-specified limits must also be approved by our Board of Directors' Land Committee.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities — Joint Ventures
We may enter into joint ventures as a means of accessing larger parcels of land, expanding our market opportunities, managing our risk profile and leveraging our capital base. While purchasing land through a joint venture can be beneficial, we currently do not view joint ventures as critical to the success of our homebuilding operations. We currently have only three such active ventures and in the fourth quarter of 2016 we entered into our first joint venture since 2008. We recently announced in a press release our plans related to this newest joint venture, which is expected to develop and sell more than 500 luxury condominiums in a highly amenitized community in Scottsdale, AZ. In addition to land development joint ventures, we also participate in one mortgage business joint venture. The mortgage joint venture is engaged in mortgage activities, providing services to both our customers and other homebuyers.
In connection with our land development joint ventures, we may also provide certain types of guarantees to associated lenders and municipalities.

Construction Operations
We typically act as the general contractor for our projects and hire experienced subcontractors on a geographic basis to complete construction at a fixed price. We usually enter into agreements with subcontractors and materials suppliers on an individual basis after receiving competitive bids. We also enter into longer-term and national or regional contracts with subcontractors and suppliers, where possible, to obtain more favorable terms, minimize construction costs and to control product consistency and availability. Our contracts require that our subcontractors comply with all laws and labor practices pertaining to their work, follow local building codes and permits, and meet performance, warranty and insurance requirements. Our purchasing and construction managers coordinate and monitor the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, and monitor compliance with zoning, building and safety codes. At December 31, 2016, we employed 700 full-time construction and warranty managers.
We specify that quality durable materials be used in the construction of our homes and we do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials, except for work in process materials for homes under construction. When possible, we negotiate price and volume discounts and rebates with manufacturers and suppliers on behalf of our subcontractors so we can take advantage of production volume. Our raw materials consist primarily of lumber, concrete, drywall and similar construction materials and are frequently purchased on a national or regional level. Such materials have historically been available from multiple suppliers and therefore we do not believe there is a supplier risk concentration. However, because such materials are substantially comprised of natural resource commodities, their cost and availability is subject to national and worldwide price fluctuations and inflation, each of which could be impacted by legislation or regulation relating to energy and climate change.
We generally build and sell homes in phases within our larger projects, which we believe creates efficiencies in land development, home construction operations and cash management. We also believe it improves customer satisfaction by reducing the number of vacant lots and construction activity surrounding completed homes. Our homes are typically completed within three to five months from the start of construction, depending upon the geographic location and the size and complexity of the home. Construction schedules may vary depending on the size of the home, availability of labor, materials and supplies, product type, location, municipal requirements and weather. Our homes are usually designed to promote efficient use of space and materials, and to minimize construction costs and time. We typically do not enter into any derivative contracts to hedge against weather or materials fluctuations as we do not believe they are particularly advantageous to our operations, although we do lock in short and mid-term pricing with our vendors for certain key construction commodities.
Marketing and Sales    
We believe that we have an established reputation for building a diversified line of attractive, high quality and efficient homes, which helps generate demand in each project. Our communication and marketing plans are tailored to target and reach our different customer segments. Part of these plans involve reaching new customers through a combination of advertising and other promotional activities, including our website at www.meritagehomes.com, social media outlets, magazine and newspaper advertisements, radio, brochures, direct mailings and the placement of strategically located signs in the vicinities near our developments to drive traffic to our communities. Our marketing strategy is aimed at differentiating us from other new homebuilders, and resale homes. We solidify this differentiation across all of our marketing and sales efforts to explain how we have thoughtfully selected and incorporated every home's energy-efficient features and benefits as part of a larger, integrated system that enables us to truly deliver on our LIFE. BUILT. BETTER. brand promise to our customers, which means having a home that is quieter, cleaner, healthier, smarter and safer.
We sell our homes using furnished model homes as a marketing tool to demonstrate to prospective homebuyers the advantages of the designs and features of our homes. At December 31, 2016, we owned 341 completed model homes and 29 models under construction and we leased back an additional 16 model homes. We generally employ or contract with interior and landscape designers who enhance the appeal of our model homes, which highlight the features and options available for the product line within a project. We typically build between one and three model homes for each actively selling community, depending upon the number of homes to be built in the project and the products to be offered. We strive to implement marketing strategies that will educate our buyers on how our unique building techniques and the energy efficient features in our homes differentiate them from other homes. In our communities, we have built "learning centers" or in-home displays in order to inform our buyers about energy-efficient features and help them understand how and to what extent a Meritage home can help them enjoy more savings through reduced energy bills, better health, improved comfort and peace of mind. 
Our homes generally are sold by our commissioned sales associate employees who work from a sales office typically located in a converted garage of one of the model homes for each project. We also employ a team of online sales associates who offer assistance to potential buyers viewing our communities and products over the Internet. At December 31, 2016, we had 475 full-time sales and marketing personnel. Our goal is to ensure that our sales force has extensive knowledge of our housing product, our energy efficient and innovative features, our sales strategies, mortgage options, and community dynamics, in order to fully execute our marketing message. To achieve this goal, we train our sales associates and conduct regular 
10

meetings to update them on our product, communities, sales techniques, competition in the area, financing availability, construction schedules, marketing and advertising plans, available product lines, pricing, options and warranties offered, as well as the numerous benefits and savings our energy efficient product provides. Our sales associates are licensed real estate agents where required by law. Our sales associates may also assist our customers to make standard selections and to select from available options and upgrades that may be available on a community by community basis, which we design to appeal to local consumer demands. In some divisions, we contract with third-party design studios that specialize in assisting our homebuyers with those selections to personalize their homes. Utilizing such third-party design studios typically allows us to manage our overhead costs more efficiently. We may offer various sales incentives, including price concessions, assistance with closing costs, and landscaping or interior upgrades, to attract buyers. The use, type and amount of incentives depends largely on economic and local competitive market conditions. Third-party brokers may also sell our homes, and are usually paid a sales commission based on the price of the home. Frequently, outside brokers bring prospective buyers to our communities. We have a robust loyalty program for these brokers and we aim to regularly educate them on the benefits of owning a Meritage home and our community offerings, which we believe helps enhance the impact of our marketing message.
We differentiate ourselves from our competitors through the superior design and value of our communities and homes, our energy-efficiency and other technologies, and our offerings and enhancements made pursuant to the results of ongoing surveying and product research efforts. We believe our commitment to design and build energy-efficient homes is aligned with buyer sensitivities about how eco-friendly designs, features and materials help impact the environment and the livability of homes, as well as their pocketbooks. We are continually evaluating buyer preferences and make adjustments to the homes we offer and the targeted price points in accordance with buyer demand. Most recently we introduced LiVE. NOW., our newest "entry-level plus" collection of product offerings targeted to the growing number of first-time homebuyers who are looking for an affordable home with features beyond a typical entry-level home and who appreciate a streamlined and expedited home purchasing process. 
Backlog
Our sales contracts require cash deposits and are subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer’s ability to qualify for financing. Additional deposits are usually collected upon the selection of options and upgrades. Homes covered by such sales contracts but which are not yet closed are considered “backlog” and are representative of potential future revenues. Started homes are excluded from backlog until a sales contract is signed and are referred to as unsold or “spec” inventory. A contract contingent upon the sale of a customer’s existing home is not considered a sale and not included in backlog until the contingency is removed. We generally require a signed sales contract to release a lot to start construction, although on a regular basis we also start a certain number of homes for speculative sales inventory, as we have had a high level of success with these quick move-in opportunities, particularly in communities that appeal to the renter and first-time buyer demographic. As a result of our strategic shift to expand our entry-level home products, we expect to grow our number of spec homes. We may also start construction on such homes to accelerate or facilitate the close-out of a community. At December 31, 2016, 77.0% of our 2,627 homes in backlog were under construction.
We do not recognize any revenue from a home sale until a finished home is delivered to the homebuyer, payment is collected and other criteria for sale and profit recognition are met. At December 31, 2016, of our total homes in inventory excluding completed model homes, 32.1% were under construction without sales contracts and 13.1% were completed homes without sales contracts. A portion of the unsold homes resulted from homesites that began construction with valid sales contracts that were subsequently canceled. We believe that during 2017 we will deliver to customers substantially all homes in backlog at December 31, 2016 under existing or, in the case of cancellations, replacement sales contracts.
The number of units in backlog decreased 2.4% to 2,627 units at December 31, 2016 from 2,692 units December 31, 2015; however, due to higher average sales prices, the value of backlog year-over-year was flat at $1.1 billion. The larger volume of closings in 2016, combined with the tempering of orders in the latter part of 2016 from fewer actively selling communities contributed to the slight decline in backlog units from prior year.
Customer Financing
Most of our homebuyers require financing. Accordingly, we refer them to mortgage lenders that offer a variety of financing options. While our homebuyers may obtain financing from any mortgage provider of their choice, we have a joint venture arrangement with an established mortgage broker that allows it to act as a preferred mortgage broker to our buyers in most of our markets to help facilitate the sale and closing process as well as generate additional revenue for us through our interest in the joint venture (See Note 4 for additional information on joint venture financial results). In some markets we also use unaffiliated preferred mortgage lenders. We may pay a portion of the closing costs to assist homebuyers who obtain financing from our preferred lenders.

Customer Relations, Quality Control and Warranty Programs
We believe that positive customer relations and an adherence to stringent quality control standards are fundamental to our continued success, and that our commitment to buyer satisfaction and quality control has significantly contributed to our reputation as a high-quality builder.
In accordance with our company-wide standards, one or more Meritage project manager or superintendent generally monitors compliance with quality control standards for each community through the building phase of our homes. These employees perform the following tasks:

• | oversee home construction;


• | monitor subcontractor and supplier performance;


• | manage scheduling and construction completion deadlines; and


• | conduct formal inspections as specific stages of construction are completed.

At the time a home is completed and delivered to a buyer, we typically hand off the process to a customer relations employee who manages the warranty and customer care efforts.    
We generally provide a one-to-two-year limited warranty on workmanship and building materials and a ten-year warranty for the structural integrity on the homes we build. We require our subcontractors to provide a warranty and indemnity to us as well as evidence of insurance before beginning work, and therefore any claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the subcontractors’ responsibility. Although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects, we are, during applicable warranty periods, ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs. Accordingly, with the assistance of an actuary, we have estimated and established reserves for future structural warranty costs based on the number of home closings and historical data trends for warranty work within our communities. Warranty reserves generally range between 0.1% to 0.6% of a home’s sale price. Those projections are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding structural defect claims for the products and labor we use in the construction of our homes, the markets in which we build, claim settlement history, and insurance and legal interpretations, among other factors and we are, therefore, constantly monitoring such reserves. Historically, these reserves have been sufficient to cover net out-of-pocket warranty costs.
Competition and Market Factors
The construction and sale of homes is a highly-competitive industry. We compete for sales in each of our markets with national, regional and local developers and homebuilders, as well as existing resale homes, and to a lesser extent, condominiums and rental housing. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and may have lower costs than we do. Competition among residential homebuilders of all sizes is based on a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, product type, amenities, design, innovation, quality and price. We believe that we compare favorably to other homebuilders in the markets in which we operate due to our:

• | experience within our geographic markets which allows us to develop and offer products that provide superior design and quality in line with the needs and desires of the targeted demographic;


• | streamlined construction processes that allow us to save on materials, labor and time and pass those savings to our customers in the form of lower prices;


• | ENERGY STAR® standards in all of our communities (except those we construct in markets in which we enter through acquisition and are in the process of converting existing product) and incremental energy-efficient features that create a variety of benefits to our customers and differentiate our product from competing new and existing home inventories;


• | ability to recognize and adapt to changing market conditions, from both a capital and human resource perspective;


• | ability to capitalize on opportunities to acquire land on favorable terms; and


• | reputation for outstanding service and quality products and our exceptional customer and warranty service.

Our product offerings and strategic locations are successfully competing with both existing homes inventory and surrounding new-home communities as evidenced by our relative orders volume and market share in most of our divisions. We expect that the strengths noted above will continue to provide us with long-term competitive advantages.
We have an extensive market research department that assists our operating divisions in each of our markets to better compete with other homebuilders, and the inventory of re-sale homes in surrounding neighborhoods. Our strategic operations team conducts in-depth community-level reviews in each of our markets, including a detailed analysis of existing inventory, pricing, buyer demographics and the identification of each location’s key buyer metrics. This analysis and resulting analytical tools assist in decision making regarding product designs, positioning, and pricing and underwriting standards for land purchases and land development. Additionally, our market research department is focused on evaluating and identifying new market opportunities.

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
To the extent that we acquire undeveloped land, we prefer to acquire land after all or most entitlements have been obtained. Construction may begin almost immediately on such entitled land upon compliance with and receipt of specified permits, approvals and other conditions, which generally are within our control. The time needed to obtain such approvals and permits affects the carrying costs of unimproved property acquired for development and construction. The continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to factors such as changes in government policies, rules and regulations, and their interpretation and application. To date, the government approval processes discussed above have caused some timing delays but have not had a material adverse effect on our development activities, although there is no assurance that these and other restrictions will not adversely affect future operations as, among other things, sunset clauses may exist on some of our entitlements and they could lapse.
Local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions. These fees are normally established when we receive recorded maps or plats and building permits. Governing agencies may also require concessions or may require the builder to construct certain improvements to public places such as parks and streets. In addition, governing agencies may impose construction moratoriums. Because most of our land is entitled, construction moratoriums typically would not affect us in the near term unless they arise from health, safety or welfare issues, such as insufficient water, electric or sewage facilities. In the long term, we could become subject to delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums, “no growth” or “slow growth” initiatives or building permit allocation ordinances, which could be implemented in the future.
In addition, there is a variety of new legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment at the federal, state and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase the cost to construct homes, although our energy-efficiency technologies and offerings meet, and in many instances exceed, current and expected energy efficiency thresholds. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and may result in increased costs and longer approval and development timelines. Similarly, energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world, and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, such initiatives could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive carbon dioxide emissions control and energy-related regulations.
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. In some markets, we are subject to environmentally sensitive land ordinances that mandate open space areas with public elements in housing developments, and prevent development on hillsides, wetlands and other protected areas. We must also comply with flood plain restrictions, desert wash area restrictions, native plant regulations, endangered species acts and view restrictions. These and similar laws and regulations may result in delays, cause substantial compliance and other costs, and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. To date, compliance with such laws and regulations has not materially affected our operations, although it may do so in the future.
We usually will condition our obligation to acquire property on, among other things, an environmental review of the land. To date, we have not incurred any material unanticipated liabilities relating to the removal or remediation of unknown toxic wastes or other environmental conditions. However, there is no assurance that we will not incur material liabilities in the future relating to toxic waste removal or other environmental conditions affecting land currently or previously owned.
In order for our homebuyers to finance their home purchases with FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed or USDA-guaranteed mortgages, we are required to build such homes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of those agencies.
Some states have statutory disclosure requirements governing the marketing and sale of new homes. These requirements vary widely from state to state.
Some states require us to be registered as a licensed contractor, a licensed real estate broker and in some markets our sales agents are required to be registered as licensed real estate agents.

Employees, Subcontractors and Consultants
At December 31, 2016, we had 1,485 full-time employees, including 276 in management and administration, 34 in our title company, 475 in sales and marketing, and 700 in construction operations. Our operations are carried out through both local and centralized corporate management. Local operations are made up of our division employees, led by management with significant homebuilding experience and who typically possess a depth of knowledge in their particular markets. Our centralized corporate management sets our strategy and leads decisions related to the Company's land acquisition, risk management, finance, cash management and information systems. Our employees are not unionized, and we believe that we have good employee relationships. We pay for a substantial portion of our employees’ insurance costs, with the balance contributed by the employees. We also have a 401(k) savings plan, which is available to all employees who meet the plan’s participation requirements.
We act solely as a general contractor, and all construction operations are coordinated by our project managers and field superintendents who schedule and monitor third party independent subcontractors. We use independent consultants and contractors for architectural, engineering, advertising and some legal services, and we strive to maintain good relationships with our subcontractors and independent consultants and contractors.
Seasonality
Historically, we experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically sell more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half, which creates additional working capital requirements in the second and third quarters to build our inventories to satisfy the deliveries in the second half of the year. We typically benefit from the cash generated from home closings more in the third and fourth quarters than in the first and second quarters. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long term, although it has been and may continue to be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
