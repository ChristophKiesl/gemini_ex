Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel cancer immunotherapy products designed to harness the power of a patient’s own immune system to eradicate cancer cells. Our lead program is an adoptive cell therapy utilizing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), which are T cells derived from patients’ tumors, for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
 
A patient's immune system, particularly their TIL, plays an important role in identifying and killing cancer cells. TIL consist of a heterogeneous population of T cells that can recognize a wide variety of cancer-specific mutations and can overcome tumor escape mechanisms. TIL therapy involves growing a patient's TIL in special culture conditions outside the patient's body, or ex vivo, and then infusing the T cells back into the patient followed by infusion of six doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2). By expanding a patient’s TIL ex vivo, away from the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment, the T cells can rapidly proliferate. As a result, billions of TIL, when infused back into the patient, are better able to search out and potentially eradicate the tumor.
 
We have an on-going Phase 2 clinical trial of our lead product candidate, LN-144, TIL for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This single-arm study is enrolling patients with melanoma whose disease has progressed following treatment with at least one systemic therapy. The trial opened for enrollment during the second half of 2015 and is being conducted at eight sites. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of our autologous TIL infusion (LN-144). The trial’s primary objective is to characterize the safety of LN-144. Secondary outcome measures efficacy of the LN-144 includes objective response and complete response rates. Additional secondary or exploratory endpoints may be considered as well. Updates from this Phase 2 trial are planned to be released in 2017.
 
During 2015, we received orphan drug designation for LN-144 in the United States to treat metastatic melanoma. This designation provides seven years of market exclusivity in the United States, subject to certain limited exceptions. However, the orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process.
 
We are pursuing metastatic melanoma as our first target indication because of the promising initial results in this indication generated by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the commercial opportunity inherent in the significant unmet need of this patient population. Melanoma is a common type of skin cancer, accounting for approximately 76,380 patients diagnosed and 10,130 deaths each year in the United States according to the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Estimated 2016 Facts and Figures. According to the NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, about 2-5% of patients with melanoma have metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic melanoma following treatment under the current standards of care have a particularly dire prognosis with very few curative treatment options.
 
In addition to our ongoing trial in metastatic melanoma, we plan to initiate clinical trials of TIL therapy in several additional cancer indications in 2017, including cervical, and head and neck cancer, and to initiate additional indications by the company as well as through collaborations which may include glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer.

Corporate Strategy
 
Our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of cell-based immunotherapies to treat solid tumors. We are developing a portfolio of TIL-based product candidates with the potential to meaningfully improve survival and quality of life for cancer patients. Key elements of our strategy include:
 
Expedite clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our lead product candidate
 
Based on results from NCI-sponsored clinical trials, we plan to advance our lead product candidate, LN-144, for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. We filed an IND with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2014 to initiate a company-sponsored Phase 2 single-arm, multicenter clinical trial of LN-144 in patients with metastatic melanoma. We began enrollment of this study in the second half of 2015 which has continued throughout 2016. Interim data from this trial is expected to be announced in 2017.
 
If data from this company-sponsored Phase 2 trial is consistent with previous results from the NCI, we plan to initiate discussions with the FDA in 2017 about a registration path for LN-144 and to thereafter conduct a multicenter pivotal trial. Assuming the results from the pivotal trial are positive, we will discuss with the FDA the filing of a Biologic License Application (BLA) for approval of LN-144 as a treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. The FDA may grant accelerated approval for product candidates for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint, including an objective response rate, because such response rate is considered reasonably likely to predict a real clinical benefit of longer life. We believe our accelerated approval strategy may be warranted given the limited options for patients with advanced melanoma. However, even if the FDA grants accelerated approval, confirmatory trials may still be required by the FDA.
 
Continue collaboration with our partners, and increase our internal research and development activities, to improve TIL manufacturing and develop new TIL therapies
 
We seek to work with government and academic research institutions, as well as corporate partners, to supplement our own efforts to improve TIL manufacturing and develop TIL therapies in new indications in clinical trials. In August 2016, we expanded our CRADA with the NCI for another 5-year term. This collaboration with the NCI offers us the opportunity to identify new indications for unmodified TIL therapy based on human proof-of-concept data, which significantly reduces the risk in our product portfolio. Our CRADA with the NCI is focused on the treatment of additional solid tumor indications, including cervical, head and neck, lung, bladder, and breast cancer.
 
In addition, in December 2016, we entered into a new three-year cooperative research agreement with Moffitt. Areas of research include an evaluation of the role of individual effector cells in the expansion of TIL from primary solid tumors, the use of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in the expansion of TIL from solid tumors, optimal expansion of TIL from various solid tumors, and phenotype and function analysis of patient blood and tumor samples from clinical trials. At the same time, we also announced a new clinical grant agreement with Moffitt where we would provide support for an ongoing clinical trial at Moffitt that combines TIL therapy with Opdivo® (nivolumab) for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma.
 
With corporate partners, in 2015 we commenced a research and clinical collaboration with Medimmune, Inc. to evaluate means to enhance TIL growth in vitro and to combine TIL therapy with durvalumab, an anti-PDL1 antibody, in patients with solid tumor indications. In 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with PolyBioCept to license certain rights to patent applications related to a cytokine cocktail for expansion of TIL.  In connection with this license, we entered into a clinical trial agreement with Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden to conduct two clinical trials in patients with pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma with TIL manufactured using the cytokine cocktail.
 
Establish initial manufacturing capacity for TIL products with contract manufacturing organizations
 
We continue to invest in improving the process and efficiency of manufacturing our product candidates. Currently we use several contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to supply our TIL-based products for our clinical trials. CMOs limit the amount of upfront capital investment; however, we may establish our own manufacturing facilities in the future for better margins and rapid implementation of innovative changes. We intend to carefully manage our cost structure, and reduce the long-term cost of manufacturing our products, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our manufacturing costs to commercially attractive levels.
 
In 2016, we entered into a new three-year manufacturing agreement with WuXi in order to increase our TIL manufacturing capacity in facilities with both clinical and commercial capability. In addition to our agreement with WuXi, we have been working with Lonza since 2011 to manufacture our TIL product. Lonza has been the manufacturer of LN-144 for our clinical trial in metastatic melanoma. We entered into a new three-year manufacturing agreement with Lonza in 2016.

Pipeline




We are developing a portfolio of TIL-based products for the treatment of solid tumors. Our lead pipeline candidate, LN-144, is an adoptive cell therapy using TIL to treat patients with metastatic melanoma. In addition to LN-144, we intend to develop additional TIL-based pipeline products to treat a variety solid tumors, as well as next-generation TIL therapies that are more potent and less costly to manufacture, and TIL in combination with other immunotherapy drugs.
 
LN-144
 
We are developing LN-144 to treat metastatic melanoma. Melanoma is a common type of skin cancer, accounting for approximately 76,380 patients diagnosed and 10,130 deaths each year in the United States according to the American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts and Figures estimates for 2016. In our ongoing Phase 2 trial, we are treating metastatic melanoma patients that have failed at least one previous treatment regimen.
 
Patients with metastatic melanoma following treatment under the current standards of care have a particularly dire prognosis with very few curative treatment options. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has recently updated its recommendations for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Initial therapy can include checkpoint inhibitors either alone or in combination (ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolimumab), targeted therapies for patients with BRAF mutations (dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib combinations or single agents) or a clinical trial. For patients not responding or progressing and having an adequate clinical status, agents selected from the previous list but of a different therapeutic class can be used as well as high dose IL-2 or a clinical trial. Patients who do not respond to the current second-line therapies have very few treatment options and typically have a very poor prognosis, with limited median survival measured in months.
 
LN-145
 
We are developing LN-145 to treat cervical and head and neck cancers. In December 2015, we submitted an IND application with the FDA to conduct clinical trials of LN-145 in these cancers, and in February 2016 we announced that the IND was allowed thereby permitting us to begin clinical trials in these indications with our product. We expect trials in these two indications to begin in 2017. According to the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Facts and Figures estimates for 2016, it is estimated that approximately 12,990 women are diagnosed in the United States every year with cervical cancer. If cervical cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or organs and/or the regional lymph nodes, the five-year survival rate is 67.5%. If the cancer has spread to a distant part of the body, the five-year survival rate is 16.8%. Head and neck cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers in the United States. This year, an estimated 48,330 people will develop head and neck cancer. It is estimated that 9,570 deaths occurred in 2016.
 
TIL in Other Solid Tumor Indications
 
We are collaborating with the NCI to evaluate unmodified TIL in other solid tumor indications such as ocular (uveal) melanoma, bladder, breast and lung cancer. We are also collaborating with Karolinska University Hospital to conduct clinical trials of TIL manufactured using a novel cytokine cocktail for expansion in pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. These trials are expected to commence in 2017.

TIL in Combination with Other Immunotherapy Drugs
 
Checkpoint inhibitors are a new class of immunotherapy drugs which seek to overcome one of cancer’s main defenses against an immune system attack. Checkpoint inhibitors are antibodies that block normal proteins on cancer cells, or the proteins on T cells (such as TIL) that respond to them. The result is to remove the brakes that prevent T cells from recognizing cells as cancerous and leading an immune system assault on them. We are collaborating with the NCI to evaluate TIL in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in a 170-patient clinical trial in patients with advanced melanoma. We have also previously collaborated with Moffitt to evaluate TIL in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor Yervoy® (ipilimumab) in a 12-patient clinical trial which is now completed and have recently announced a collaboration with Moffitt to evaluate TIL in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo® (nivolumab) in a 12-patient clinical trial.
 
Immune system
 
The immune system recognizes danger signals and responds to threats at a cellular level. The most significant components of the cellular aspect of the adaptive immune response are T cells (or T lymphocytes), so called because they mature in the thymus and are distinguished from B cells which mature in the bone marrow. T cells can be distinguished from other white blood cells by T cell receptors present on their cell surface. These receptors contribute to tumor surveillance by helping T cells recognize infected cells as well as cancerous cells. T cells are involved in both sensing and killing infected or cancerous cells, as well as coordinating the activation of other cells in an immune response.
 
Although the immune system is designed to identify foreign or abnormal proteins expressed on tumor cells, this process is often defective, or not operating optimally, in cancer patients. The defective process sometimes occurs when the cancer cells closely resemble healthy cells and go unnoticed or if tumors lose their protein expression. Additionally, cancer cells employ a number of mechanisms to escape immune detection to suppress the effect of the immune response. Some tumors also encourage the production of regulatory T cells that prevent cytotoxic T cells from attacking the cancer.
 
Cancer immunotherapy
 
Despite the progress that has been made over the past several decades, effective treatment of cancer, especially solid tumors, continues to be challenging. Some reasons solid tumors are so difficult to treat are: (i) in many solid tumors, multiple genes (as many as hundreds or thousands of genes) are mutated, and solid tumors are heterogeneous, (ii) it is not always clear which particular mutations are critical, and (iii) tumors can adapt and find a way to evade treatments that target a single mutation. In addition, the tumor can suppress the patient’s natural immune response. When T cells with cancer-specific receptors are absent, present in low numbers, of poor quality or rendered inactive by suppressive mechanisms employed by tumor tissue, the cancer can grow and spread to various organs. In addition, standard of care treatments for cancer can be deleterious to T cells' ability to kill cancer.
 
We believe that adoptive cell therapy, with the use of human cells as therapeutic entities to reengage the immune system, will be the next significant advancement in the treatment of cancer. These cellular therapies may avoid the long-term side effects associated with current treatments and have the potential to be effective regardless of the type of previous treatments patients have experienced. We believe TIL therapy in particular has the potential to treat solid tumors by increasing the effectiveness and number of a patient's cancer-specific T cells.
 
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
 
Adoptive cell therapy with TIL involves (1) harvesting T cells from a patient's tumor, (2) culturing and (3) expanding the number of TIL, and (4) infusing the functional TIL back into the patient followed by treatment with IL-2. TIL are a heterogeneous population of T cells that can recognize and kill cancer cells. Currently, the TIL manufacturing process that we are developing takes approximately five to six weeks from receipt of the patient's tumor to infusion of the TIL back into the patient. We currently treat patients with a single infusion of TIL after they receive a short chemotherapy lymphodepletion regimen, which is intended to improve the survival and proliferative capacity of the newly infused T cells. After infusion, the TIL can proliferate inside a patient and potentially infiltrate the tumor microenvironment to eliminate large numbers of cancer cells. TIL can overcome several mechanisms of tumor escape to which endogenous T cells may be susceptible.

Clinical results with TIL in metastatic melanoma
 
To date, hundreds of metastatic melanoma patients have already been treated with TIL therapy at different hospitals in the US, Europe, Canada, and Israel. At NCI, clinical responses have been relatively consistent: approximately 50% of the melanoma patients treated with TIL have an objective response (i.e. tumor regression of 50% or more), and approximately 24% of patients have a complete response with no evidence of disease remaining after only one administration. Many patients respond to TIL therapy despite experiencing tumor progression after previously being treated with other therapies.
 
In September 2015, Dr. Rosenberg, a recognized pioneer in immuno-oncology and adoptive cell therapy using TIL, presented updated findings from a Phase 2 clinical trial of TIL therapy in metastatic melanoma at the American Association for Cancer Research Inaugural International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference. Data was presented from a 101 patient, Phase 2 clinical trial conducted at the NCI.  In the trial, patients with advanced metastatic melanoma were equally divided in two groups.  Both groups were treated according to a standard TIL protocol using nonmyeloablative chemotherapy, with the second group also receiving total body irradiation. 56% of the patients treated with TIL therapy achieved an objective response. An objective response occurs when there is a complete remission or a partial remission of the tumor. Out of the 101 patients, 24 (24%) had experienced a complete remission and 23 of the 24 (96%) showed ongoing durability of this response at 30 to 47 months following treatment at the time of publication.  Median follow-up time was approximately 40.9 months.  Overall survival (OS) was approximately 80% at 12 months, and median OS had not yet been achieved.  Median progression-free survival was approximately 10 months, and 35% of patients were without disease progression at 4 years. This observation was also presented by Stephanie Goff at the 2016 ASCO meeting and published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in June.

Overall Survival of patients in TIL ± TBI study

Clinical results with TIL in other solid tumor indications
 
Under our CRADA with the NCI, we are providing research and development and clinical funding for the development of unmodified TIL therapy for a variety of solid tumor indications, including cervical, head and neck, bladder, breast, and lung cancers. The NCI has completed a clinical trial involving TIL therapy to treat advanced human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive cervical cancer. Data from this trial was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in April 2015. Out of nine cervical cancer patients treated with HPV-TIL, two experienced complete remissions reported as ongoing at 22 and 15 months. Another patient experienced a three-month partial remission. Additionally, the NCI has ongoing trials to treat patients using TIL within lung cancer, bladder and breast cancer. Depending on results from the research and development and clinical trials conducted at the NCI under our CRADA, we may pursue the development and regulatory approval of TIL therapy for additional indications.
Safety
 
Overall, toxicities or adverse events during TIL therapy have almost entirely been associated with the either the lymphodepletion regimen or the high-dose IL-2 therapy given after TIL infusion as assessed by Rosenberg. Severe and life threatening toxicities due to TIL therapy occur mostly in the first week after cell infusion but generally resolve within a few weeks. To date, some patients have experienced vitiligo and uveitis, but there has been no other evidence of off-target effects associated with TIL therapy.
 
Toxicities which occur following administration of IL-2 but are thought to be related to the cells include immune mediated events such as vitiligo, transient uveitis, hearing loss, and vestibular dysfunction. The use of the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen prior to cell administration increases the toxicity of this treatment as myelosuppression occurs in all patients.
 
The standard approach to the administration of high-dose IL-2 in all studies is to continue dosing until patients can no longer tolerate treatment, although the toxicities observed with ‘adjuvant’ IL-2 to TILs with only a single cycle and 6 doses are limited. As noted by Goff et al., the toxicities of treatment were largely a result of the known adverse effects of nonmyeloablative chemotherapy and administration of high-dose IL-2. These toxicities may sometimes require intubation for protection of the patient’s airway. Although these patients require significant supportive measures during this period, all toxicities are reversible and the overwhelming majority of patients have suffered no long term sequelae following this treatment regimen.
 
Next generation TIL product strategies
 
We hold an exclusive license from the NCI to a patent family directed to select TIL for various cell surface markers in order to treat patients with metastatic melanoma. This next-generation TIL technology supports more potent and efficient TIL production by selecting for TIL that express various activating receptors, including 4-1BB and PD-1. TIL that express these proteins are associated with higher tumor reactivity, so potentially fewer of the enriched cells are needed to be therapeutically effective. Selected TIL technology has the potential to reduce the time and cost of manufacturing.

In addition to selected TIL, we are evaluating strategies to genetically engineer TIL, and to pre-condition tumors from which we expand TIL so that more TIL are present at the time of tumor excision.
 
Process development and manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing and processing of TIL-based product candidates is based on the NCI’s original manufacturing and processing of TIL, which we have modified so that it can be reproduced in a Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) environment. We believe we have streamlined and improved the NCI’s original process to be able to produce TIL in a cGMP facility.
 
The processing of LN-144 begins with the collection of the patient’s tumor, which is then sent to a central processing facility, where the T cells are isolated. These cells are stimulated to proliferate, then propagated in cell culture flasks until sufficient cells are available for infusion back into the patient. The TIL is then washed and put in media suitable for infusion at the cell processing site and shipped back to the clinical center where they can be administered to the patient. In preparation for administration of the TIL, the patient undergoes a short chemotherapy lymphodepletion regimen, which is intended to improve the survival and proliferative capacity of the newly infused T cells. The following diagram illustrates our current TIL manufacturing process.
 

We have entered into Manufacturing Services Agreements with Lonza and WuXi pursuant to which they have agreed to manufacture, package, ship and handle quality assurance and quality control of certain clinical trials for our TIL products. The production line for LN-144 is established at Lonza and is providing product for our Phase 2 trial in metastatic melanoma. Our production line at WuXi is available to manufacture TIL for both a clinical and commercial setting. Cell processing activities will be conducted at both companies under current good manufacturing processes, or cGMP, using qualified equipment and materials. We believe that all materials and components utilized in the production of the final TIL product is readily available from qualified suppliers. We expect to rely on Lonza and WuXi to meet anticipated clinical trial demands. In the future, we may rely on them or other third parties, or develop our own manufacturing capabilities for the manufacturing and processing of TIL-based product candidates for our clinical trials. To meet projected needs for commercial sale quantities, we may develop our own commercial manufacturing facility to supply and process products. Developing our own manufacturing capabilities may require more costs than we anticipate or result in significant delays. If we are unable to develop our own manufacturing capabilities, we will rely on contract manufacturers, including both current and alternate suppliers, to ensure sufficient capacity is available for commercial purposes.
 
The Manufacturing and Services Agreement that we entered into on November 23, 2016 with WuXi governs the terms under which we may, from time to time, engage WuXi, under separate statements of work, to provide manufacturing and other services. The agreement will also govern certain work orders placed under a prior cell therapy development and manufacturing that we entered into with WuXi in September 25, 2015. Each statement of work describes the services to be performed by WuXi, the consideration to be paid for such services, and other details related thereto the requested work. To date, we have entered into two such statements of work for two cGMP manufacturing suites to be established and operated by WuXi for us, one of which is expected to be capable of being used for the commercial manufacture of our products. The fee payable under the first statement of work for the use of one of the manufacturing suites during the first year of the agreement, including the fees for the necessary personnel, was $2.5 million. Under the second statement of work, WuXi agreed to establish and operate a second, dedicated facility for a late stage/commercial manufacturing cGMP suite to be established at WuXi’s facilities, and we agreed to transfer our current tumor infiltrating lymphocyte manufacturing process to the dedicated cGMP cell processing suite. The fee payable under the second statement of work for the use of one of the manufacturing suites during the first year, including the fees for the necessary personnel, is $5.85 million. Under the two statements of work, we agreed to pay WuXi additional fees based on the amount of testing, analysis, raw materials purchased and manufacturing/production services provided by WuXi.

The WuXi Manufacturing and Services Agreement has a three-year term. However, we may terminate that agreement or any statement of work by providing written notice of termination not less than 30 days in advance of the date of termination; provided, that we shall remain liable for any fees owed under any outstanding statement of work, including termination fees. WuXi may terminate the agreement by providing written notice of termination not less than 180 days in advance of the date of termination; provided, that, the Manufacturing and Services Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any statements of work outstanding at the time that such termination becomes effective.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
During 2015, we received orphan drug designation for LN-144 in the United States to treat metastatic melanoma. This designation provides seven years of market exclusivity in the United States, subject to certain limited exceptions. However, the orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process.
 
Commercialization plan
 
We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities. As we progress our clinical trials for our leading product candidates, we will build our own sales and commercialization capabilities in support of commercialization of TIL.
 
We believe we can address physicians who treat metastatic melanoma with a direct specialty sales force. In the U.S., there are approximately 76,380 patients diagnosed with melanoma each year. According to SEER approximately 2-5% of patients with melanoma have metastatic disease. If LN-144 is approved, since an important part of the TIL therapy regimen includes treatment with IL-2 after the patient receives their TIL, we expect to commercialize the product in the U.S. with a focused specialty sales force targeting hospitals and clinics that have experience in treating patients with IL-2.
 
Additionally, we are developing LN-145 to treat cervical and head and neck cancers. We also anticipate that these patients will be treated at the same hospitals that have experience in treating patients with IL-2. It is estimated that approximately 12,990 women are diagnosed in the U.S. every year with cervical cancer. If cervical cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or organs and/or the regional lymph nodes, the five-year survival rate is 67.5%. If the cancer has spread to a distant part of the body, the five-year survival rate is 16.8%. Head and neck cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers in the U.S. This year, an estimated 48,330 people will develop head and neck cancer in this country. It was estimated that 9,570 deaths will occur in 2016 from this disease.
 
Outside the US, we have not yet defined our commercial strategy for our TIL products. Our commercial strategy for markets outside the US may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial infrastructure. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for one of our product candidates.
 
As additional product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, size of the development programs, size of the target market, size of a commercial infrastructure, intellectual property protection and manufacturing needs may all influence our U.S., Europe and rest-of-world strategies.
 
Intellectual property
 
Intellectual property is of importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We plan also to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. To achieve this objective, a strategic focus for us has been to identify and license key patents that provide protection and serve as an optimal platform to enhance our intellectual property and technology base.
 
We have also engaged in the development of our own patent portfolio based on internal research and development activities in 2016. As a result, we now own a number of pending patent applications in the fields of TIL therapy, TIL manufacturing processes, and TIL expansion methods, and we expect to further develop our patent portfolio as a strategic focus in 2017.
 
Research, development and license agreements
 
Currently, our research and development is conducted with the NCI under the CRADA, with Moffitt under our Collaborative Research Agreement, and at our own internal research and development laboratory in Tampa, Florida. We also have clinical collaborations with the NCI under our CRADA, and with Moffitt and Karolinska University Hospital under clinical trial agreements.
 
In addition, we have the exclusive, co-exclusive, and non-exclusive licenses to certain patent rights with the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), Moffitt and PolyBioCept AB described below in this Annual Report.

Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI
 
In August 2011, we signed a five-year CRADA with the NCI to work with Dr. Steven Rosenberg on developing adoptive cell immunotherapies that are designed to destroy metastatic melanoma cells using a patient’s tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.
 
In January 2015, we executed an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the CRADA to include four new indications. As amended, in addition to metastatic melanoma, the CRADA included the development of TIL therapy for the treatment of patients with bladder, lung, triple-negative breast, and HPV-associated cancers.
 
In August 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the CRADA. The principal changes effected by the second amendment included (i) extending the term of the CRADA by another five years to August 2021, and (ii) modifying the focus on the development of unmodified TIL as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with FDA-licensed products and commercially available reagents routinely used for adoptive cell therapy. The parties agreed to continue the development of improved methods for the generation and selection of TIL with anti-tumor reactivity in metastatic melanoma, bladder, lung, breast, and HPV-associated cancers.
 
Each party to the CRADA individually owns all inventions, data and materials produced solely by its employees in the course of performing the activities under the CRADA. The parties jointly own any inventions and materials that are produced by employees of both parties in the course of performing activities under the CRADA. Subject to certain conditions, this collaboration provides us with the first option to negotiate commercialization licenses from the NIH to intellectual property relating to TIL-based product candidates conceived or first reduced to practice in performance of the CRADA research plan. This includes the right to negotiate a license to intellectual property related to TIL-based product candidates that are being tested in multiple clinical trials that we are funding under the CRADA. We may exercise this right by providing written notice after either (1) we receive notice that a patent application covering an invention has been filed, or (2) the date on which we file a patent application for an invention. We then have ten months to negotiate the license with the NIH. These time periods may be extended by the U.S. Public Health Service upon good cause. Pursuant to the terms of the CRADA, we are currently required to make quarterly payments of $0.5 million to the NCI for support of research activities. To the extent we license patent rights relating to a TIL-based product candidate, we will be responsible for all patent-related expenses and fees, past and future, relating to the TIL-based product candidate. In addition, we will be required to supply certain test articles, including TIL, grown and processed under cGMP conditions, suitable for use in clinical trials, where we hold the IND for such clinical trial. The extended CRADA has a five-year term expiring in August 2021. Although there can be no assurance, we anticipate that we will renew the agreement on similar terms. The CRADA may be terminated at any time by mutual written consent. We or NCI may unilaterally terminate the CRADA for any reason or for no reason at any time by providing written notice at least 60 days before the desired termination date.
 
Patent License Agreements with the National Institutes of Health
 
Patent License Agreement Related to the Development and Manufacture of TIL
 
Effective October 5, 2011, we entered into a Patent License Agreement with the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the United States Public Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services (NIH), which Patent License Agreement was subsequently amended on February 9, 2015 and October 2, 2015. Pursuant to the License Agreement as amended, the NIH granted us licenses, including exclusive, co-exclusive, and non-exclusive licenses, to certain technologies relating to autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte adoptive cell therapy products for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, lung, breast, bladder and HPV-positive cancers. The Patent License Agreement requires us to pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales (which percentage is in the mid-single digits), a percentage of revenues from sublicensing arrangements, and lump sum benchmark royalty payments on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for each of the various indications and other direct costs incurred by the NIH pursuant to the agreement.
Exclusive Patent License Agreement Related to TIL Selection
 
On February 10, 2015, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement with the NIH under which we received an exclusive license to the NIH’s rights to patent-pending technologies related to methods for improving adoptive cell therapy through more potent and efficient production of TIL from melanoma tumors by selecting for T-cell populations that express various inhibitory receptors. Unless terminated sooner, the license shall remain in effect until the last licensed patent right expires.
 
In consideration for the exclusive rights granted under the Exclusive Patent License Agreement, we agreed to pay the NIH a non-refundable upfront licensing fee. We also agreed to pay customary royalties based on a percentage of net sales of a licensed product (which percentage is in the mid-single digits), a percentage of revenues from sublicensing arrangements, and lump sum benchmark payments upon the successful completion of clinical studies involving licensed technologies, the receipt of the first FDA approval or foreign equivalent for a licensed product or process resulting from the licensed technologies, the first commercial sale of a licensed product or process in the United States, and the first commercial sale of a licensed product or process in any foreign country. We will also be responsible for all costs associated with the preparation, filing, maintenance and prosecution of the patent applications and patents covered by the license.

Research Collaboration Agreement with Moffitt
 
In September 2014, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Moffitt to jointly engage in transitional research and development of adoptive tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapy with improved anti-tumor properties and process.
 
In December 2016, we entered into a new three-year Sponsored Research Agreement with Moffitt. At the same time, we entered into a Clinical Grant Agreement with Moffitt to support an ongoing clinical trial at Moffitt that combines TIL therapy with Opdivo® (nivolumab) for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma.
 
Exclusive License Agreement with Moffitt
 
We entered into a license agreement with Moffitt (the “Moffitt License Agreement”), effective as of June 28, 2014, under which we received a world-wide license to Moffitt’s rights to patent-pending technologies related to methods for improving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for adoptive cell therapy. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the license extends until the earlier of the expiration of the last patent related to the licensed technology or 20 years after the effective date of the license agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Moffitt License Agreement, we paid an upfront licensing fee and agreed to pay a patent issuance fee, upon the issuance of the first U.S. patent covering the subject technology. In addition, we also agreed to pay milestone license fees upon completion of specified milestones, customary royalties based on a specified percentage of net sales (which percentage is in the low single digits) and sublicensing payments, as applicable, and annual minimum royalties beginning with the first sale of products based on the licensed technologies, which minimum royalties will be credited against the percentage royalty payments otherwise payable in that year. We also agreed to be responsible for all costs associated with the preparation, filing, maintenance and prosecution of the patent applications and patents covered by the Moffitt License Agreement related to the treatment of any cancers in the United States, Europe and Japan and in other countries selected that we and Moffitt agree to.
 
Exclusive License Agreement with PolyBioCept
 
In September 2016, we entered into an exclusive and co-exclusive license agreement (the “PolyBioCept License Agreement”) with PolyBioCept AB, a corporation organized under the laws of Sweden. PolyBioCept has filed two patent applications with claims related to a cytokine cocktail for use in expansion of lymphocytes. Under the PolyBioCept License Agreement, we received the exclusive right and license to PolyBioCept’s intellectual property to develop, manufacture, market and genetically engineer TIL produced by expansion, selection and enrichment using a cytokine cocktail. The Company also received a co-exclusive license (with PolyBioCept) to develop, manufacture and market genetically engineered TIL under the same intellectual property. The licenses are for the use in all cancers and are worldwide in scope, with the exception that the uses in melanoma are not included for certain countries of the former Soviet Union.
 
We paid PolyBioCept a total of $2.5 million as an up-front exclusive license payment and agreed to make milestone payments to PolyBioCept under the PolyBioCept License Agreement if, and when, (i) certain product development milestones are achieved, (ii) certain regulatory approvals have been obtained from the FDA and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and (iii) certain product sales targets are achieved. The milestone payments will be payable both in cash (U.S. dollars) and in shares of our common stock. If all of the foregoing product development, regulatory approval and sales milestone payments are met, we will have to pay PolyBioCept an additional $8.7 million and will have to issue to PolyBioCept a total of 2,219,376 shares of unregistered common stock. In addition to these potential payments, we agreed to reimburse PolyBioCept for up to $0.2 million in expenses related to the transfer of know-how and to pay PolyBioCept $0.1 million as a clinical trials management fee.
 
The PolyBioCept License Agreement has an initial term of 30 years, and may be extended for additional five-year periods. The PolyBioCept License Agreement will automatically terminate if this company files a petition for reorganization, bankruptcy or insolvency, is served with an involuntary petition in any insolvency proceeding, and such petition is not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the filing thereof, becomes insolvent or discontinues business, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any similar arrangement under any bankruptcy law. The PolyBioCept License Agreement also may be terminated by PolyBioCept if we materially breach the agreement, if we challenge any of the patents licensed under the agreement, or after a third material breach by us in any consecutive six-month period. The PolyBioCept License Agreement also may be terminated by PolyBioCept if we do not achieve certain product development milestones or regulatory approvals, except that in all cases other than or requirement to commence a Phase I Trial, PolyBioCept’s right to terminate can be removed by paying PolyBioCept a milestone payment in lieu of meeting the milestone or obtaining the regulatory approval.
 
Clinical Trials Agreement with Karolinska University Hospital
 
In connection with the execution of the PolyBioCept License Agreement, we also (i) entered into a clinical trials agreement with the Karolinska University Hospital to conduct clinical trials in glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer at the Karolinska University Hospital, and (ii) agreed to enter into a sponsored research agreement with the Karolinska Institute for the research of the cytokine cocktail in additional indications. In 2016 we paid Karolinska University Hospital $1.6 million under this agreement to conduct the clinical trials.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries put significant resources in developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of cancer. We compete with many different sources in the space of immunotherapy, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, as well as companies developing novel targeted therapies for cancer. Universities and public and private research institutions in the U.S. and Europe are also potential competitors. For example, a Phase 3 study comparing TIL to standard ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma is currently being conducted in Europe by the Netherlands Cancer Institute, the Copenhagen County Herlev University Hospital, and the University of Manchester. While these universities and public and private research institutions primarily have educational objectives, they may develop proprietary technologies that lead to other FDA approved therapies or that secure patent protection. We anticipate that we will face possibly increasing competition as new drugs and therapies enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
 
Due to their promising clinical therapeutic effect in clinical exploratory trials, we anticipate substantial direct competition from other organizations developing advanced T-cell therapies. In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with genetically engineered T cells rendered reactive against tumor-associated antigens prior to their administration to patients. Genetically engineered T cells are being pursued by several companies, including Adaptimmune, Celgene (in collaboration with bluebird bio), Kite Pharma, Juno Therapeutics, Novartis and others. To date, these technologies have been applicable to hematologic malignancies, but it is conceivable that such genetic modification may be applied further to TIL and create competition with Lion.
 
While other types of cancer immunotherapies may potentially be used in combination with TIL, such as checkpoint blockers, to enhance efficacy, we also expect substantial direct competition from other types of immunotherapies. We face competition from immunotherapy treatments offered by companies such as Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Merck, and Roche. Immunotherapy is also being pursued by several biotechnology companies as well as by large-cap pharmaceutical companies. We cannot predict whether other types of immunotherapies may be enhanced and show greater efficacy and may have direct and substantial competition from such immunotherapies in the future.
 
Many potential competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect.
 
We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
Government regulations
 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is begun; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigations to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually when significant changes are made. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a new product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 
Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 

· | Phase I- The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


12
--


· | Phase II- The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III- The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase IV- In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase IV studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Phase I, Phase II and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial User Fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended if the FDA requests additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.

--

 

In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase II meeting with FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis.
 
Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
In 2015, we received orphan drug status for LN-144 in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. We plan to seek orphan drug designation for some or all of our other product candidates in specific orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for the use of these products.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identify of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. However, the orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process.
 
A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.

In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Our sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional state laws similar to the foregoing.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
 
The False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, which will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.

Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
In the EU, member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the EU regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. It is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes. Because our products are produced in that way, we would be subject to the centralized process. Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states, as well as the EEA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. By law, a company can only start to market a medicine once it has received a marketing authorization.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 51 employees, of whom the majority are full-time, 14 held Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 39 were engaged in research and development activities and 12 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, or administrative support. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key scientific, technical and senior management personnel.
