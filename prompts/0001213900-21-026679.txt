ITEM 1. BUSINESSOverview
 
We are a developmental stage biopharmaceutical company focused on merging traditional therapeutics with psychedelic research. We seek to acquire assets to license and fund research which we believe will be transformative to the well-being of patients and the health care industry, and we are committed to developing innovative solutions to address a variety of underserved conditions. In these uncertain times, the mental health of the nation and beyond is being put to the test. More than ever, creative new therapies are needed to address the health challenges of today. Combining our resources with world-class medical research partners, we hope to make significant advances in the medical and psychedelic space.
Rare Disease Therapeutics
 
We seek to acquire and/or develop intellectual property or technology rights from leading universities and researchers to treat rare diseases, including the use of psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, and the potential benefits they may have in certain cases involving depression, mental health issues and neurological disorders. We are focused on merging traditional therapeutics with psychedelic research for people suffering from indications such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), Parkinson’s, and other rare neurological disorders. Our mission is to identify assets to license and fund the research which we believe will be transformative to the well-being of patients and the health care industry. 
 
Psilocybin is considered a serotonergic hallucinogen and is an active ingredient in some species of mushrooms. Recent industry studies using psychedelics, such as psilocybin, have been promising, and we believe there is a large unmet need with many people suffering from depression, mental health issues and neurological disorders. While classified as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), there is an accumulating body of evidence that psilocybin may have beneficial effects on depression and other mental health conditions. Therefore, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) have permitted the use of psilocybin in clinical studies for the treatment of a range of psychiatric conditions.
 
The potential of psilocybin therapy in mental health conditions has been demonstrated in a number of academic-sponsored studies over the last decade. In these early studies, it was observed that psilocybin therapy provided rapid reductions in depression symptoms after a single high dose, with antidepressant effects lasting for up to at least six months for a number of patients. These studies assessed symptoms related to depression and anxiety through a number of widely used and validated scales. The data generated by these studies suggest that psilocybin is generally well-tolerated and has the potential to treat depression when administered with psychological support.
 
We have recently engaged in discussions with a number of world-renowned educational institutions and advisors regarding potential opportunities and have formed a scientific advisory board that is intended to help advise management regarding potential acquisition and development of products. In addition, we entered into certain sponsored research and/or license agreements, as more fully described below, and are seeking to enter into additional scientific research agreements and partnerships with other universities.
 
We plan to actively pursue the acquisition and/or development of intellectual property or technology rights to treat rare diseases, and to ultimately expand our business to focus on this new line of business.

Patent License Agreement with AIkido Pharma Inc.
 
On January 5, 2021, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (the “AIkido License Agreement”) with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Silo Pharma, Inc., and AIkido Pharma Inc. (“AIkido”) pursuant to which we granted AIkido an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license to certain intellectual property (i) to make, have made, use, provide, import, export, lease, distribute, sell, offer for sale, develop and advertise certain licensed products and (ii) to develop and perform certain licensed processes for the treatment of cancer and symptoms caused by cancer. The AIkido License Agreement relates to the rights which we had obtained under the UMB Option Agreement. Pursuant to the AIkido License Agreement, we agreed that if we exercised the UMB Option, we would grant AIkido a non-exclusive sublicense to certain UMB patent rights in the field of neuroinflammatory diseases occurring in patients diagnosed with cancer. The UMB Option was exercised on January 13, 2021. Accordingly, on February 12, 2021, we entered into a binding letter of intent with AIkido pursuant to which we agreed to grant AIkido a worldwide, exclusive sublicense to our licensed patents under the UMB License Agreement (See “Binding Letter of Intent to Grant Sublicense with AIkido Pharma Inc.”). 
 
Pursuant to the AIkido License Agreement, AIkido agreed to pay us, among other things, (i) a one-time non-refundable cash payment of $500,000 and (ii) royalty payments equal to 2% of Net Sales (as defined in the AIkido License Agreement) in the field of use in the territory covered by such agreement. In addition, AIkido issued us 500 shares of its Series M Convertible Preferred Stock. The AIkido License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the licensed patents set forth in the AIkido License Agreement, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the AIkido License Agreement.
 
Binding Letter of Intent to Grant Sublicense with AIkido Pharma Inc.
 
Following the execution of the UMB License Agreement, and in accordance with the terms of the AIkido License Agreement, we entered into a binding letter of intent (the “Letter of Intent”) with AIkido, on February 12, 2021, pursuant to which we agreed to grant AIkido a worldwide, exclusive sublicense to our licensed patents under the UMB License Agreement for use in the therapeutic treatment of neuroinflammatory disease in cancer patients. Pursuant to the Letter of Intent, AIkido agreed to pay us (i) a one-time license fee of $50,000 and (ii) the same royalty payments that we are subject to under the UMB License Agreement.

More specifically, the study is designed to evaluate (1) whether MS-1-displaying liposomes can effectively deliver dexamethasone to the central nervous system and (2) whether MS-1-displaying liposomes are superior to plain liposomes, also known as free drug, in inhibiting the relapses and progression of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis. Pursuant to the agreement, the shall commence on March 1, 2021 and will continue until substantial completion thereof, subject to renewal upon mutual written consent of the parties. The total cost under the agreement shall not exceed $81,474.
 
NFID Branded Apparel
 
In addition to our primary focus on psychedelic research, we have also been engaged in the development of a streetwear apparel brand, NFID, which stands for “No Found Identification”. We originally acquired the assets relating to the NFID brand pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, entered into on September 29, 2018, with Blind Faith Concepts Holdings, Inc., in exchange for 2,000,000 shares of our common stock. The acquired NFID assets consisted of three trademarks related to the NFID brand, the NFID website, shoe designs and samples, as well as the assumption of a one-year Brand Ambassador Agreement.
 
We have developed NFID as an exclusive brand of apparel consisting initially of sweatshirts, hoodies, t-shirts, jackets and hats. Our clothing brand features lifestyles graphic designs. The collection is inspired towards the lifestyle and wellness culture.
 
Recent Financing
 
February 2021 Private Placement
 
On February 9, 2021, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors pursuant to which, on February 12, 2021, we sold an aggregate of 4,276 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase up to 14,253,323 shares of our common stock in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately $4,276,000, before deducting placement agent and other offering expenses. The warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance at an exercise price of $0.30 per share, subject to adjustment, and subject to certain exceptions, may be exercised on a cashless basis. In connection with the offering, we entered into separate registration rights agreements with the investors pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement to register the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants which we initially filed on February 16, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the offering, we issued the placement agents warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,850,664 shares of our common stock. The placement agent warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the closing date of the offering at an exercise price of $0.35 per share, subject to adjustment.

Intellectual Property
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties. Our policy is to actively seek the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our products, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents. Specifically, we try to ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party that create intellectual property for us or that assign any intellectual property rights to us. In addition, we have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and entities with which we conduct business.
 
To date, we have filed four provisional patent applications related to the use of the central nervous system-homing peptides covered by the UMB Option Agreement to deliver certain compounds, including a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and/or psilocybin, for the treatment of arthritis, central nervous system diseases, neuroinflammatory diseases as well as cancer. In addition, pursuant to our acquisition of NFID, we acquired three trademarks related to the NFID brand.
 
Competition
 
With respect to the rare disease therapeutics segment of our business, our industry is characterized by many newly emerging and innovative technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary product rights. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and medical research organizations. Any product candidates that we may successfully develop and commercialize will compete with the standard of care and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many of the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with whom we may compete have established markets for their therapies and have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market superior products or therapies. In addition, many of these potential competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking non-clinical studies and human clinical trials of new therapeutic substances and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals for alternative or superior products. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. An increasing number of companies are increasing their efforts in discovery of new psychedelic compounds.
 
Government Regulation
 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with any potential our vendors, contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), its implementing regulations and other laws. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

The process required by the FDA before any product candidates are approved as drugs for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice requirements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Completion of the manufacture, under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing; 
● | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”) which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
● | Approval by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
● | Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); 
● | Payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; 
● | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA, to accept the filing for review; 
● | Satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
● | Potentially, satisfactory completion of FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 

Controlled Substances
 
The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
 
The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules — Schedule I, II, III, IV or V — with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence.

Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s).
 
The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non-narcotic substances may be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary, to ensure that the United States complies with its obligations under international drug control treaties.
 
For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.
 
The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
 
Employees
 
As of March 25, 2021, we employed a total of one full-time employee. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated as Gold Swap, Inc. (“Gold Swap”) under the laws of the State of New York on July 13, 2010.
 
On December 11, 2012, stockholders approved changing our state of incorporation from New York to Delaware via the merger of Gold Swap with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, Point Capital, Inc., and to change our name from “Gold Swap Inc.” to “Point Capital, Inc”. The merger was effective on January 24, 2013.
 
On May 21, 2019, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to change our name to “Uppercut Brands, Inc,” and on September 24, 2020, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to change our name to “Silo Pharma, Inc.”.

Through September 28, 2018, we were a closed-end, non-diversified investment company that had elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). As a business development company, we were required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally had to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets”, including securities of private U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
 
On September 29, 2018, we filed Form N-54C, Notification of Withdrawal of election to be Subject to Section 55 through 65 of the Investment Company Act, because we changed the nature of our business so as to cease to be a business development company. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, our consolidated financial statements of have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As a result of this change in status, we discontinued applying the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946 - Financial Services – Investment Company and account for the change in our status prospectively by accounting for our equity investments in accordance with ASC Topics 320 - Investments—Debt and Equity Securities as of the date of the change in status. In addition, the presentation of the financial statements are that of a commercial company rather than that of an investment company.
 
In accordance with ASC 946, we made this change to our financial reporting prospectively, and did not restate periods prior to our change in status to a non-investment company effective September 29, 2018. Accordingly, we may refer to both accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles applicable to corporations (“Corporation Accounting”), which applied commencing September 29, 2018 and to that applicable to investment companies under the Investment Company Act (“Investment Company Accounting”) which applied to prior periods. We determined that there is no cumulative effect of the change from Investment Company Accounting to Corporation Accounting on periods prior to those presented, and that there is no effect on our financial position or results of operations as a result of this change.
 
In order to maintain our status as a non-investment company, we will continue to operate so as to fall outside the definition of an “investment company” or within an applicable exception. We expect to continue to operate outside the definition of an “investment company” as a developmental stage company primarily engaged in merging traditional therapeutics with psychedelic research.
 
Through March 31, 2017, we elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and operated in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. At March 31, 2017, we failed the diversification test since our investment in Ipsidy Inc. accounted for over 25% of our total assets. We did not cure our failure to retain our status as a RIC and we will not seek to obtain RIC status again. Accordingly, beginning in 2017, we became subject to income taxes at corporate tax rates. The loss of our status as a RIC did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations.
 
Currently, we are not making any new equity investments.
 
On September 29, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Blind Faith Concepts Holdings, Inc. pursuant to which we completed the acquisition of 100% of the assets of NFID from the seller which consisted of three trademarks related to the NFID brand, the NFID website, shoe designs and samples, and the assumption of a one-year Brand Ambassador Agreement in exchange for 2,000,000 shares of our common stock. NFID is a recently developed unisex clothing brand. We plan on continuing product development to fully launch the product. Our acquisition of the NFID assets gives us access to the growing market for unisex products. 
 
On November 5, 2018, we entered into 14 separate Return to Treasury Agreements, whereby certain stockholders holding an aggregate of 28,734,901 shares of our common stock agreed to return a portion of their respective holdings to treasury in exchange for cash payments aggregating $2,872. As a result, the total issued and outstanding number of our common stock was reduced by 28,734,901 shares.
 
On April 8, 2020, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Silo Pharma Inc., in the State of Florida.
 
Our Corporate Information
