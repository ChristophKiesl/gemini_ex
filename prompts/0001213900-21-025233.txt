The transaction was accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, Enlightened was deemed to be the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on the facts that, immediately following the Merger: (i) Enlightened’s stockholders owned a substantial majority of the voting rights in the combined company. As a result of the Recapitalization Transaction, the shareholders of Enlightened received the largest ownership interest in the Company, and Enlightened was determined to be the “accounting acquirer” in the Recapitalization Transaction. As a result, the historical financial statements of the Company were replaced with the historical financial statements of Enlightened. The number of shares prior to the reverse capitalization have been retroactively adjusted based on the equivalent number of shares received by the accounting acquirer in the Recapitalization Transaction.

Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Employees
 
As of May 10, 2021, we have two employees, all of whom are officers. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Offices
 
The Company’s principal offices are located at 3 Kiryat Hamada, 3rd floor, Jerusalem, Israel. Our telephone number is 1-305-999-5232.
 
Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required governments approvals present that we need approval from or any existing government regulation on our business.
 
We currently have not obtained any copyrights, patents or trademarks. We do not anticipate filing any copyright or trademark applications related to any assets over the next 12 months.
 
Going Concern
 
Our cash balance is $Nil as of November 30, 2019. We do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations beyond one year’s time.
 
Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.
 
We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, if any, will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company will seek to obtain these funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements, debt or other sources of financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
 
At the present time, we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock, it will likely not be sufficient to support our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations, we will either suspend product development and marketing activities until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely
 
Subject to raising working capital, for which we have no commitments, management may also consider other business opportunities, including a strategic merger or acquisition outside our current line of business, in order to increase shareholder value.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
 
Limited operating history; Need for additional capital
 
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
 
We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.
