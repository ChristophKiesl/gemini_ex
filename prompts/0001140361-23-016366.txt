Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on January 7, 2021. We were incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination.
 
We seek to capitalize on the nearly 100 years of combined investing and operating experience of our management team. We believe our management team is uniquely qualified to identify, acquire and operate businesses that can benefit from our industry, operating and investment experience, and the established relationships of our management team, Industry Advisors and board of directors to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, we intend to focus our search broadly within the consumer and distribution related and adjacent industries. Investment opportunities are sourced through our proprietary and differentiated network and deep relationships with executives, advisors, and intermediaries built over decades of investing in and operating consumer and distribution businesses.
 
Our company was founded by the senior executives of Twin Ridge Capital Management, LLC (“TRCM”) and is led by our Chairman, Dale F. Morrison, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and President, Sanjay K. Morey and our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, William P. Russell, Jr. We believe that we derive significant benefit from our affiliation with TRCM. Founded in 2011, TRCM is a private investment firm that makes investments in consumer and distribution companies, with a particular focus on investing in food, food distribution, and other food-related companies. The firm’s investment thesis is to identify strong companies led by excellent management teams with the desire to take on an active partner who can help drive transformational operational change in their business. For each investment opportunity, TRCM develops detailed investment theses and operational improvement plans which have the potential to create highly attractive returns. Over the course of their careers, the partners of TRCM have overseen approximately $2.9 billion in equity capital across 30 investments.
 
On March 6, 2023, we held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (“Extension Meeting”) to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination. In connection with that vote, the holders of 15,042,168 Class A ordinary shares of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $153,567,547 or $10.21 per share. After the satisfaction of such redemptions and receipt of the initial deposit of $480,000 to the Trust Account, the balance in our trust account was approximately $64,457,034.
 
Proposed Carbon Revolution Business Combination
 
 Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed
 
On November 29, 2022, the Company, Carbon Revolution, Carbon Revolution Limited (formerly known as Poppetell Limited), a private limited company incorporated in Ireland with registered number 607450 (“MergeCo”), and Poppettell Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of MergeCo (“Merger Sub” and, together with the Company, Carbon Revolution and MergeCo, collectively, the “Parties” and each a “Party”), entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), and on November 30, 2022 Carbon Revolution, the Company and MergeCo entered into the Scheme Implementation Deed (the “Scheme Implementation Deed”).

 
 Entry into the Business Combination Agreement and the Scheme Implementation Deed, and the respective transactions contemplated thereby (the “Transactions”) were unanimously approved by the board of directors of each of the Company and Carbon Revolution.
 
The Business Combination and the Scheme Implementation Deed
 


 
 The Business Combination Agreement provides for the business combination, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company shall be merged with and into MergerSub, with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MergeCo (the “Surviving Company”), (the “Merger”), subject to, among other things, the approval of the Company’s shareholders.

 
 Under the Scheme Implementation Deed, Carbon Revolution has agreed to propose a scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Scheme”) and a capital reduction under Part 2J.1 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Capital Reduction”) which, if implemented, will result in all shares of Carbon Revolution (the “Carbon Revolution Shares”) being cancelled in return for consideration, with Carbon Revolution issuing a share to MergeCo (resulting in Carbon Revolution becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of MergeCo), subject to Carbon Revolution shareholder approval, approval of the Federal Court of Australia and the satisfaction of various other conditions (a full list of the conditions is set out in the Scheme Implementation Deed).

 
 Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement and the Scheme Implementation Deed, certain members of management and all the directors of Carbon Revolution entered into voluntary escrow deeds with Carbon Revolution, pursuant to which, such individuals agreed to certain lock-up restrictions on Carbon Revolution Shares held by each such member of management or director of Carbon Revolution, as applicable, effective from November 29, 2022 until the Implementation Date (as defined in the Scheme Implementation Deed) of the Scheme.
 
Consideration

 
 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Scheme Implementation Deed, shareholders of Carbon Revolution will receive, in exchange for each Carbon Revolution Share, a number of ordinary shares of MergeCo (the “MergeCo Ordinary Shares”) pursuant to the Scheme Implementation Deed (as at the Scheme Record Date (as defined in the Scheme Implementation Deed)) calculated in the following manner: $200,000,000 (y)(i) less Outstanding Debt (as defined in the Scheme of Arrangement – Share Scheme) (ii) plus Cash (as defined in the Scheme of Arrangement – Share Scheme) and (z) divided by US$10.00, with such total amount, divided by the total number of the Carbon Revolution Shares on issue as at the Scheme Record Date (or which would be on issue if all securities of Carbon Revolution convertible into Carbon Revolution Shares had converted on such date).

 
 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or holder of securities, at the SPAC Merger Effective Time (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) (a) each of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares shall convert automatically on a one-for-one basis, into the Company’s Class A ordinary shares (the “Pre-Merger Conversion”), (b) immediately after the Pre-Merger Conversion, each Class A ordinary share will be automatically cancelled in exchange for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable MergeCo Ordinary Share, (c) the public warrants shall be automatically exchanged for one warrant to acquire one MergeCo Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (“MergeCo Public Warrants”), subject to substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the warrant agreement pursuant to which such public warrant was issued immediately prior to the SPAC Merger Effective Time (d) each private placement warrant shall be automatically exchanged for one MergeCo Public Warrant (each, a “MergeCo Founder Warrant”) with each such MergeCo Founder Warrant being subject to substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the warrant agreement pursuant to which such SPAC Private Warrant was issued immediately prior to the SPAC Merger Effective Time and (e) each ordinary share of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the SPAC Merger Effective Time shall be converted into, and exchanged for, one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Company.

Under the Business Combination Agreement and the Scheme Implementation Deed, the parties thereto made customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type, with respect to the parties, the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the Scheme Implementation Deed and their respective business operations and activities. The representations and warranties made under the Business Combination Agreement and the Scheme Implementation Deed shall terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby. The representations and warranties made under the Business Combination Agreement and the Scheme Implementation Deed are solely for the benefit of the parties thereto.

 The Scheme Implementation Deed may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to 8:00am on the Second Court Date (as defined in the Scheme Implementation Deed), including:
 


 
 (a) by Carbon Revolution if the Company (in the case of a termination by Carbon Revolution) or the Company if Carbon Revolution, MergeCo or MergerSub (in the case of a termination by the Company) (1) has materially breached the Scheme Implementation Deed or the Business Combination Agreement and the party in breach has failed to remedy the breach within ten business days (or such shorter period ending at 5:00pm on the business day before the Second Court Date) after receipt by it of a notice in writing from the terminating party setting out details of the relevant circumstances and stating an intention to terminate the Scheme Implementation Deed, (2) if the Federal Court of Australia or another government agency (including any other court) has taken any action permanently restraining or otherwise prohibiting or preventing the Merger or the Scheme, or has refused to do anything necessary to permit the Merger and the Scheme to be implemented by the End Date (as defined in the Scheme Implementation Deed), and the action or refusal has become final and cannot be appealed or reviewed or the party, acting reasonably, believes that there is no realistic prospect of an appeal or review succeeding by the End Date, (3) if the Effective Date (as defined in the Scheme Implementation Deed) of the Scheme has not occurred, or will not occur, on or before the End Date, or (4) if the shareholders of Carbon Revolution have not agreed to the Scheme and Capital Reduction at the Scheme Meeting (as defined in the Scheme Implementation Deed) by the requisite majorities;

 Related Agreements
 
Sponsor Side Letter
 
 Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement and the Scheme Implementation Deed, the Sponsor, the TRCA Subsidiary, Alison Burns (“Burns”), Paul Henrys (“Henrys”) and Gary Pilnick (“Pilnick” together with Burns and Henrys, the “Independent Directors”) and Dale Morrison (“Morrison”), Sanjay K. Morey (“Morey”) and William P. Russell, Jr. (“Russell”, and together with Morrison and Morey, the “Other Insiders”, and together with Sponsor, TRCA Subsidiary and the Independent Directors, the “Sponsor Parties”), the Company, Carbon Revolution and MergeCo entered into a Sponsor Side Letter (the “Sponsor Side Letter”), pursuant to which the Sponsor Parties have agreed to take, or not take, certain actions during the period between the execution of the Sponsor Side Letter and the consummation of the Merger, including, (i) to vote any ordinary shares of the Company owned by such Sponsor Party (all such shares, the “Covered Shares”) in favor of the Merger and the Scheme and other related proposals at the shareholders’ meeting of the Company, and any other special meeting of the Company’s shareholders called for the purpose of soliciting shareholder approval in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the Scheme, (ii) to waive the anti-dilution rights or similar protections with respect to the Class B ordinary shares owned by such party as set forth in the governing documents of the Company, or otherwise, and (iii) not to redeem any Covered Shares (as defined in the Sponsor Side Letter) owned by such Sponsor Party.
 


 
 Pursuant to the Sponsor Side Letter, Sponsor has also agreed that, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, and conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, 327,203 of the 5,267,203 Class B ordinary shares beneficially owned by Sponsor shall be automatically forfeited and surrendered to the Company for no additional consideration.
 
 Standby Equity Purchase Agreement
 
 Concurrently with the parties entering into the Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed, the Company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the “CEF”) with YA II PN, Ltd. (“Yorkville”) pursuant to which, subject to the consummation of the Transactions, MergeCo has the option, but not the obligation, to issue, and Yorkville shall subscribe for, an aggregate amount of up to $60 million of MergeCo Ordinary Shares at the time of MergeCo’s choosing during the term of the agreement, subject to certain limitations, including caps on exchanges, issuances and subscriptions based on trading volumes. Each advance under the CEF (an “Advance”) may be in an amount of MergeCo Ordinary Shares up to the greater of $10 million or the aggregate daily trading volume of MergeCo Ordinary Shares in the five trading days prior to MergeCo requesting an Advance. The purchase price for an Advance is determined at the option of MergeCo and is either (a) 95% of the average daily VWAP (as defined below) during the applicable one-day pricing period or (b) 97% of the lowest daily VWAP during the applicable three consecutive trading day pricing period.   “VWAP” means, for any trading day, the daily volume weighted average price of MergeCo Ordinary Shares for such date on the securities listing exchange that the MergeCo Ordinary Shares are trading as of such date during regular trading hours as reported by Bloomberg L.P. The CEF will continue for a term of three years commencing from the sixth trading day following the closing of the business combination, unless prior terminated pursuant to its terms.
Underwriting Agreement
 
As representatives of the underwriters from our initial public offering, Barclays Capital Inc. (“Barclays”) and Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) were entitled to deferred underwriting commission of approximately $3,729,042 and $3,729,042, respectively, which commission would have been waived by the underwriters in the event that the Company did not complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with our initial public offering. The deferred fee is payable only if a business combination is consummated, without regard to the number of the Class A ordinary shares redeemed by the public shareholders in connection with a business combination. On November 15, 2022, the Company received formal letters from each of Barclays and Evercore, that each bank has agreed to waive its right to the deferred underwriting commission, and did not receive any payment from the Company in connection with the fee waiver and will not receive any payment from the Company in connection with the business combination, other than Barclay’s receipt of reimbursement for reasonable expenses. Each of Barclays and Evercore has not performed any additional services for the Company after our initial public offering for any contingent fees, and is not expected to perform any additional services following the consummation of the business combination.  The waiver of fees for services that have already been rendered is unusual. Our board of directors does not expect that the waiver of the deferred underwriting commission will have any significant impact on the business combination other than reducing the amount of expenses associated with the business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers: Dale F. Morrison, Sanjay K. Morey and William P. Russell. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Also, Dale F. Morrison, as Chairman, does not have day-to-day control of our affairs and is not involved in our day-to-day operations.
Industry Advisors
 
We have assembled a large and highly accomplished team of Industry Advisors, each of whom invested in our Sponsor, to assist us in the sourcing, evaluation, due diligence, deal execution and value-creation strategies of prospective business combination partners. With their in-depth industry knowledge, extensive domain and transaction experience and exceptionally broad professional networks, our Industry Advisors are important partners to our management team.
 
We believe the experience of our Industry Advisors is a differentiating element in our approach, magnifies the breadth and depth of industry sectors where we have expertise and increases our likelihood of finding and completing a suitable business combination. Importantly, we believe our Industry Advisors can potentially fill critical roles in the leadership teams or on the board of directors of prospective business combination partners while also providing access to their vast network of industry executives, helping our management team drive value-creation strategies at the combined company.

Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and build a company in the consumer or distribution sector that complements the experience of our management team, Industry Advisors and directors and that can benefit from their collective operational experience of over 200 years.
 
We are evaluating a broad range of targets across all segments of the consumer and distribution industries including, without limiting our scope, businesses that focus on the food, food distribution, and other food-related industries.

We believe there are a large number of companies operating within these sizeable and growing sectors which possess various attractive qualities that are key to successful public companies such as resilient financial profiles through economic cycles, predictable revenues and high cash flow generation, scale opportunities, brand equity and innovation, and both organic and inorganic growth opportunities
 
Our management team, Industry Advisors and directors bring together a number of competitive strengths that contribute in our ability to successfully execute a transaction within these industries, including:
 

• | a track record of successfully identifying and acquiring companies and deploying a value creation toolkit to deliver shareholder value over an extended time period;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | substantial depth of industry experience which enables us to understand market trends, quickly evaluate business models and gauge their fit with our investment criteria;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | significant experience leading many of North America’s largest consumer and distribution companies, and developing and executing shareholder value creation programs including recruiting world-class management, identifying growth opportunities, delivering operating efficiencies and successfully integrating strategic acquisitions; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a deep network of senior-level industry executives who can be recruited to enhance target company management teams to help accelerate implementation of our value creation initiatives;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a vast and highly leverageable deal sourcing network providing significant reach and access to a comprehensive opportunity set imperative to the sourcing process for our initial business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a history of accessing the public capital markets across various business cycles, including assisting companies with the transition to public ownership and providing leadership within public companies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a deep expertise in proprietary and brokered deal sourcing, financial and operational due diligence, transaction negotiation and execution, equity and debt financing and managing multiple acquisitions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Members of our management team, Industry Advisors and directors are utilizing their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters of our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potentially interesting leads. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.
 
Our Acquisition Criteria
 
In line with our business strategy, our management team has identified certain criteria and non-exhaustive guidelines that helps inform our evaluation of prospective targets. Although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the criteria described below, it is our intention to acquire companies with the following characteristics:

• | fundamentally sound but underperforming their potential and exhibit unrecognized value creation opportunities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | can benefit from our team’s ability to harness its extensive industry sector experience and professional networks to develop and implement our collection of value-creation operational strategies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strong competitive market positioning driven by brand equity, advantages of scope or scale, differentiated products or services, proprietary technology, robust infrastructure or strong customer or supplier relationships;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attractive financial profile with multiple avenues for continued future growth and margin upside that result in sustainable free cash flow generation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experienced and public-ready management team with internal reporting and control systems that can comply with the requirements of a public listing; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential to offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders across business cycles.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Given the strength of our relationships, network, reputation, expertise and proprietary deal flow, our management team is provided with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. We believe we are well-positioned to identify potential target businesses with appropriate valuations which can benefit from new capital for growth and a public listing.
 
Our Business Combination Process
 
As the deal sourcing process yields targets that we believe are strong candidates for a business combination, we began conducting a comprehensive due diligence review process which includes, among other things, analyzing both historical and projected financial data, meetings with key stakeholders and senior management, on-site visits of facilities, interviews with suppliers and customers, legal diligence, and other reviews and analyses which may be necessary.
 


 
Additionally, we are leveraging our value creation framework, including operational and capital allocation experience, in order to:
 

• | Acquire the target company at an attractive price relative to our view of its intrinsic value:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon completion of a thorough due diligence process, we will conduct comprehensive and detailed analyses of each business, both operational and financial, to arrive at a fair view of the intrinsic value of any potential business combination. We may leverage various operational, financial, and industry experts to further develop our analyses. Certain metrics we may use include relative valuation benchmarks for each industry, relevant precedent transactions within each sector, profitability and future cash flow potential and other valuation methods we deem appropriate in order to effect a business combination at an attractive price relative to the intrinsic value of the target company.
 

• | Enhance operational performance through driving organic growth, increasing profitability and strengthening market position:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Conducting rigorous research and analysis from the bottom-up is core to our strategy. Our management team, Industry Advisors and directors have significant experience in systematically creating substantial equity value as owners and operators of consumer and distribution companies. Our framework is structured around strengthening corporate leadership and implementing data driven competitive strategies and best practices to achieve operational improvements and organizational efficiencies which lead to profitable organic growth, increased market share, and improved margin profile and cash flow generation.
 

• | Optimize capital structure to establish a strong financial profile in support of future growth:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe our expertise in structuring M&A transactions and operating businesses enable the team to execute a business combination with an effective capital structure that supports future long-term growth, providing the flexibility for investments in organic and inorganic growth opportunities while maintaining a strong financial profile.
 

• | Seek follow-on strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further grow shareholder value:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The management team are continuously examining and reviewing the strategic direction of the company and may determine follow-on acquisitions or divestitures of non-core assets are strategically and/or financially appropriate. For example, the team may seek consolidation opportunities in the company’s primary and/or adjacent sectors in addition to vertical or horizontal integration opportunities.
 
Following the completion of our initial business combination, we will seek to drive additional shareholder value by leveraging the collective experience of our management team, Industry Advisors and directors to develop and implement various operational, financial and other corporate strategies. We seek to improve long-term profitability, cash flow generation and liquidity. As the business evolves, we may access capital markets, consider strategic acquisitions or divestitures, evaluate corporate governance or any other initiatives we identify to improve shareholder value.
 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, Industry Advisors or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, Industry Advisors or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion that our initial business combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view from either an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 


 
Members of our management team, our Industry Advisors or members of our board of directors may directly or indirectly own our founder shares, ordinary shares and/or private placement warrants following our initial public offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers, Industry Advisors and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer, director or Industry Advisor is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers, Industry Advisors or directors become aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. For a list of our executive officers and entities for which a conflict of interest may or does exist between such officers and the company, please refer to “Management—Conflicts of Interest.”
 
In addition, our Sponsor and our officers, Industry Advisors and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
So long as our securities are then listed on the NYSE, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our Sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test.
 


 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Other Considerations
 
Past performance of our management team or our Industry Advisors is not a guarantee of either (i) success with respect to a business combination that may be consummated or (ii) the ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction. You should not rely on the historical record of management and its affiliates or our advisors as indicative of future performance. See “Risk Factors—Past performance by our management team or our Industry Advisors or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.” Our management has no prior experience in operating blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies.

We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
 


 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.23 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30 or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
 
Competition
 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for business combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
 We have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.


We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America  (“GAAP”), or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination by the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.


We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains, or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains, or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures, or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
