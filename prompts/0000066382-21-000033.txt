Raw Materials
The Company's manufacturing materials are available from a significant number of sources within North America, South America, Europe and Asia. The costs of certain direct materials used in the Company's manufacturing and assembly operations are sensitive to shifts in commodity market prices. In particular, the costs of steel, plastic, aluminum components and particleboard are sensitive to the market prices of commodities such as raw steel, aluminum, crude oil, lumber and resins. Increases in the market prices for these commodities can have an adverse impact on the Company's profitability. Further information regarding the impact of direct material costs on the Company's financial results is provided in Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this report, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. 
Herman Miller, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Etc.
The Company has active utility and design patents in the United States. Many of the inventions covered by these patents also have been patented in a number of foreign countries. Various trademarks, including the name and stylized “Herman Miller” and the “Herman Miller Circled Symbolic M” trademark are registered in the United States and many foreign countries. The Company does not believe that any material part of its business depends on the continued availability of any one or all of its patents or trademarks, or that its business would be materially and adversely affected by the loss of any such marks, except for the following trademarks: Herman Miller®, Herman Miller Circled Symbolic M®, Maharam®, Geiger®, Design Within Reach®, DWR®, HAY®, naughtone®, Nemschoff®, Action Office®, Aeron®, Mirra®, Embody®, Setu®, Sayl®, Cosm®, Caper®, Eames®, Eames Lounge & Ottoman Configurations, Eames Aluminum Group Configuration, and Canvas Office Landscape®.
Working Capital Practices
Information concerning the Company's working capital levels relative to its sales volume can be found under the Executive Overview section in Item 7 of this report, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. Beyond this discussion, the Company does not believe that it or the industry in general has any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding the Company's business.
Customer Base
The Company approximates that no single dealer accounted for more than three percent of the Company's net sales in the fiscal year ended May 29, 2021. The Company estimates that the largest single end-user customer accounted for $113.0 million, $122.9 million and $129.6 million of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. This represents approximately five percent of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company's ten largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 17 percent of net sales in fiscal 2021 and 18 percent of net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019.
Backlog of Unfilled Orders
As of May 29, 2021, the Company's backlog of unfilled orders was $446.9 million. At May 30, 2020, the Company's backlog totaled $470.8 million. The decrease in backlog in the current year was primarily due to delays in processing customer orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 and related facility shut-downs. It is expected that substantially all the orders forming the backlog at May 29, 2021, will be filled during the next fiscal year. Many orders received by the Company are reflected in the backlog for only a short period while other orders specify delayed shipments and are carried in the backlog for up to one year. Accordingly, the amount of the backlog at any particular time does not necessarily indicate the level of net sales for a particular succeeding period.
Government Contracts
Other than standard provisions contained in contracts with the United States Government, the Company does not believe that any significant portion of its business is subject to material renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of various government entities. The Company sells to the U.S. Government both through a General Services Administration ("GSA") Multiple Award Schedule Contract and through competitive bids. The GSA Multiple Award Schedule Contract pricing is principally based upon the Company's commercial price list in effect when the contract is initiated, rather than being determined on a cost-plus-basis. The Company is required to receive GSA approval to apply list price increases during the term of the Multiple Award Schedule Contract period.
Competition
All aspects of the Company's business are highly competitive. From an office furniture perspective, the Company competes largely on design, product and service quality, speed of delivery and product pricing. Although the Company is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the world, it competes with manufacturers that have significant resources and sales as well as many smaller companies. The Company's most significant competitors are Haworth, HNI Corporation, Kimball International, and Steelcase. 
The Company also competes in the home furnishings industry, primarily against national, regional and independent home furnishings retailers who market high-craft furniture to end-user customers and the interior design community. 
 2021 Annual Report


These competitors include companies such as Crate & Barrel Holdings, Inc., Hive Modern, Restoration Hardware, Room & Board, Wayfair and Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Similar to its office furniture product offerings, the Company competes primarily on design, product and service quality, speed of delivery and product pricing in this market.
On July 19, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Knoll, Inc. Refer to the "Executive Overview" and "Business Overview" sections within Item 7 for further discussion of the acquisition of Knoll as well as in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
Research, Design and Development
The Company believes it draws great competitive strength from its research, design and development programs. Through research, the Company seeks to understand, define and clarify customer needs and problems they are trying to solve. The Company designs innovative products and services that address customer needs and solve their problems. The Company uses both internal and independent research resources and independent design resources. Exclusive of royalty payments, the Company spent approximately $50.8 million, $54.3 million and $58.8 million on design and research activities in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Generally, royalties are paid to designers of the Company's products as the products are sold and are included in the Design and Research line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
Environmental Matters
The Company believes that a business must stand for more than just its products and services and the Company's people around the globe share a commitment to using business as a force for good. The Company’s commitment to the planet is embedded in its corporate strategy and will continue to develop as the Company outlines next steps in its sustainability strategy. As part of this commitment, the Company focuses on operating its global footprint with minimal impact on the environment and designing products with materials and processes that are safe for both people and the planet. Based on current facts known to management, the Company does not believe that existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. However, there can be no assurance that environmental legislation will not result in or require material capital expenditures or additional costs to our manufacturing process.
Human Resources
The Company considers its employees to be another of its major competitive strengths. The Company stresses individual employee participation and incentives, believing that this emphasis has helped attract and retain a competent and motivated workforce. The Company's human resources group provides employee recruitment, education and development, as well as compensation planning and counseling. Additionally, there have been no work stoppages or labor disputes in the Company's history. As of May 29, 2021, approximately four percent of the Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are employees of its Nemschoff and Herman Miller Holdings Limited subsidiaries.
As of May 29, 2021, the Company had approximately 7,600 employees, which was consistent with May 30, 2020. In addition to its employee workforce, the Company uses temporary labor to meet fluctuating demand in its manufacturing operations.
