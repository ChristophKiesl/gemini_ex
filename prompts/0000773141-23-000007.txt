Our financial services operations include subsidiaries that provide mortgage financing, place title insurance and homeowner insurance for our homebuyers, and provide general liability insurance for our subsidiaries and most of our subcontractors.
Homebuilding Operations
Operating Divisions. The primary functions of our homebuilding segments include land acquisition and development, home construction, sales and marketing, and customer service. Operating decisions are made by our local management teams under the oversight of our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), or decision-making group, defined as two key executives - our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our organizational structure (i.e., the grouping and reporting of divisions) changes based upon the current needs of the Company. We had 21 active homebuilding operating divisions at December 31, 2022. We had 21 active homebuilding operating divisions at December 31, 2021 and 17 active homebuilding operating divisions at December 31, 2020.
Corporate Management. Our homebuilding business is managed primarily through members of senior management in our Corporate segment and our four Asset Management Committees (“AMCs”), three for reviewing real estate transactions and one for reviewing corporate transactions. Each real estate AMC is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and at least one of our other corporate officers, with the corporate AMC comprised of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  All real estate acquisition transactions are reviewed to confirm that the transaction is projected to achieve the objectives established by our decision-making group and must be approved by the designated real estate AMC. Generally, the role of our senior management team and/or AMC includes:
•review and approval of division business plans and budgets;
•oversight of land and home inventory levels;
•review of major personnel decisions; and
•review of capital allocation decisions.
Additionally, our corporate executives and corporate departments generally are responsible for establishing and monitoring compliance with our policies and procedures. Among other things, the corporate office has primary responsibility for:

•treasury;
•insurance and risk management;
•merchandising and marketing;
•national purchasing contracts;
•accounting, tax and internal audit functions;
•legal matters;
•human resources and payroll;
•information technology; and
•training and development.
Housing. Generally, our homebuilding subsidiaries build single-family detached homes in a number of standardized series, designed to provide variety in the size and style of homes for our potential homebuyers. In certain markets, our homebuilding subsidiaries build and sell duplexes. Within each series of our single-family detached homes, our homebuilding subsidiaries build several different floor plans offering standard and optional features (such as upgraded appliances, cabinetry, flooring, etc.). Differences in sales prices of similar models from market-to-market depend primarily upon homebuyer demand, home prices offered by our competitors, market conditions (such as home inventory supply levels), location, cost of land, optional features and design specifications. The series of homes offered at a particular location is based on perceived customer preferences, lot size, area demographics and, in certain cases, the requirements of major land sellers and local municipalities. In general, our homebuilding subsidiaries focus on selling “build-to-order,” also referred to as “dirt sales,” and limit the number of homes started without a contract, also known as “spec homes.” Based on the sudden increase in interest rates during 2022, we have seen an increased preference for spec homes that can be closed within 30 - 60 days. As a result, we have increased the number of spec home construction starts in recent months in response to this demand.
Land Acquisition and Development. Our homebuilding subsidiaries acquire lots with the intention of constructing and selling homes on the acquired land. Generally, we prefer to purchase finished lots using option contracts, in phases or in bulk for cash. However, because there often is significant competition for finished lots, more than one-half of the lots we purchase require some level of development. In making land purchases, we consider a number of factors, including projected rates of return, estimated gross margins from home sales, sales prices of the homes to be built, mortgage loan limits within the respective county, population and employment growth patterns, proximity to developed areas, estimated cost and complexity of development including environmental and geological factors, quality of schools, estimated levels of competition and demographic trends.
In their option contracts, our homebuilding subsidiaries generally obtain the right to purchase lots in consideration for an option deposit in the form of cash or letters of credit. In the event they elect not to purchase the lots within a specified period of time, they may be required to forfeit the option deposit. Our option contracts do not contain provisions requiring our specific performance.
Our homebuilding subsidiaries may own or have the right under option contracts to acquire undeveloped parcels of real estate that they intend to develop into finished lots. They generally develop land in phases in order to limit our risk in a particular subdivision and to efficiently employ available capital resources. Generally, building permits and utilities are available and zoning is suitable for the current intended use of substantially all of our undeveloped land. When developed, these lots generally will be used in our homebuilding activities. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Labor and Raw Materials. Materials used in our homebuilding operations are mainly standard items carried by major suppliers. We generally contract for our materials and labor at a fixed price for the anticipated construction period of our homes. This allows us to mitigate the risks associated with increases in the cost of building materials and labor between the time construction begins on a home and the time it is closed. Increases in the cost of building materials and subcontracted labor may reduce gross margins from home sales to the extent that market conditions prevent the recovery of increased costs through higher home sales prices. From time to time and to varying degrees, we may experience shortages in the availability of building materials and/or labor in each of our markets. These shortages and delays may result in delays in the delivery of homes under construction, reduced gross margins from home sales, or both. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above. Current shortages in the availability of building materials and labor are described in more detail in our description of Risk Factors under the heading "Supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could continue to increase costs and delay deliveries."
Warranty. Our homebuilding subsidiaries sell their homes with limited third-party warranties that generally provide for one year of coverage for workmanship and materials, two years of coverage for plumbing, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and structural coverage for an amount of time depending on the jurisdiction in which the house was

purchased. Under our agreement with the issuer of the third-party warranties, our homebuilding subsidiaries perform all of the work for the first two years of the warranty coverage and pay for certain work required to be performed subsequent to year two.
Seasonal Nature of Business. The homebuilding industry can experience noticeable seasonality and quarter-to-quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels. The seasonal nature of our business is described in more detail in our description of Risk Factors under the heading “Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate.”
Backlog. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, homes under contract but not yet delivered (“backlog”) totaled 2,974 and 7,640, respectively, with an estimated sales value of $1.75 billion and $4.30 billion, respectively. We anticipate that homes in backlog at December 31, 2022 generally will close during 2023 under their existing home order contracts or through the replacement of an existing contract with a new home order contract. The estimated backlog sales value at December 31, 2022 may be impacted by, among other things, subsequent home order cancellations, incentives provided, and/or options and upgrades selected. See “Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Customer Service and Quality Control. Our homebuilding divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ post-closing needs. We have a product service and quality control program, focused on improving and/or maintaining the quality of our customers’ complete home buying and homeownership experience.
Sales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing programs are designed to attract homebuyers in a cost-effective manner. We have a centralized in-house advertising and marketing department, including digital marketing, that oversees our efforts to communicate the inherent value of our homes to our prospective homebuyers and distinguish our Richmond American Homes brand from our competitors and other home buying opportunities. The main objective of this team is to generate homebuyer leads, which are actively pursued by our HomeBuyer Resource Center (HBRC) and community sales associates. Our HBRC team consists of new home specialists local to each market we build in, who are dedicated to supporting our digital and phone leads and set appointments for them to meet at one of our sales centers with a community sales associate. Our centralized in-house merchandising team furnishes our model homes and sales centers.
Another important part of our marketing presentation takes place in our design centers (also known as Home Galleries). Here, homebuyers are able to personalize their homes with a variety of options and upgrades. Additionally, these locations often serve as an information center for prospective homebuyers and real estate agents who may opt to receive personalized attention from one of our new home specialists, resulting in a more focused and efficient home search across all of our Richmond American communities in a given market place. We believe that the services provided by our Home Galleries represent a key competitive advantage in attracting and retaining prospective homebuyers who prefer to personalize their home purchase.
Competition. The homebuilding industry is fragmented and highly competitive. The competitive nature of our business is described in more detail in our description of Risk Factors.
Regulation. Our homebuilding operations are subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which are described in more detail in our description of Risk Factors.
Financial Services Operations
Mortgage Lending Operations
General. HomeAmerican is a full-service mortgage lender and the principal originator of mortgage loans for our homebuyers. HomeAmerican has a centralized loan processing center where it originates mortgage loans, primarily for our homebuyers.
HomeAmerican is authorized to originate Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) (together “the government-sponsored enterprises”), Federal Housing Administration-insured (“FHA”), and Department of Veterans Affairs-guaranteed (“VA”) mortgages and is an authorized issuer of Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) mortgage-backed securities. Furthermore, HomeAmerican also is an authorized loan servicer for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae and, as such, is subject to the rules and regulations of these entities.
HomeAmerican uses a mortgage repurchase facility, internally generated funds, and temporary financing provided by its parent to finance the origination of mortgage loans until they are sold. HomeAmerican sells originated mortgage loans to 
Table of Contents

third-party purchasers on either a bulk or flow basis. Mortgage loans sold on a bulk basis include the sale of a package of substantially similar originated mortgage loans, while sales of mortgage loans on a flow basis are completed as HomeAmerican originates each loan. Mortgage loans sold to third-party purchasers include HomeAmerican’s representations and warranties with respect to certain borrower payment defaults, credit quality issues and/or misstatements made by HomeAmerican or misrepresentations by our homebuyers. Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated by HomeAmerican are sold to third-party purchasers, generally between 5 to 35 days of origination.
Pipeline. HomeAmerican’s mortgage loans in process for which a rate and price commitment had been made to a borrower that had not closed (the “locked pipeline”) at December 31, 2022 and 2021 had an aggregate principal balance of approximately $394.0 million and $268.8 million, respectively, and were under interest rate lock commitments at an average interest rate of 5.50% and 2.91% respectively.
Forward Sales Commitments. HomeAmerican is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates. We mitigate our exposure to interest rate market risk relating to mortgage loans held-for-sale and interest rate lock commitments using: (1) forward sales of mortgage-backed securities, which are commitments to sell a specified financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified price, (2) mandatory delivery forward loan sale commitments, which are obligations of an investor to buy loans at a specified price within a specified time period, and (3) best-effort delivery forward loan sale commitments, which are obligations of an investor to buy loans at a specified price subject to the underlying mortgage loans being funded and closed. The market related risks in our business are described in more detail in our description of Risk Factors.
Competition. HomeAmerican has significant competition with other mortgage bankers to arrange financing for our homebuyers. The competitive nature of our mortgage business is described in more detail in our description of Risk Factors.
Regulation. Our mortgage lending operations are subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which are described in more detail in our description of Risk Factors.
Insurance Operations
General. Allegiant and StarAmerican were formed to provide insurance coverage of homebuilding risks for our homebuilding subsidiaries and most of our homebuilding subcontractors. Allegiant was organized as a risk retention group under the Federal Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981. Allegiant, which began operations in June of 2004, is licensed as a Class 3 Stock Insurance Company by the Division of Insurance of the State of Hawaii and is subject primarily to the regulations of its state of incorporation. StarAmerican is a single parent captive insurance company licensed by the Division of Insurance of the State of Hawaii. Pursuant to agreements executed on an annual basis since June of 2004, StarAmerican has re-insured Allegiant for all claims in excess of $50,000 per occurrence up to $3.0 million per occurrence prior to July 1, 2022, and up to $5.0 million per occurrence subsequent to July 1, 2022, subject to various aggregate limits.
Allegiant generates premium revenue generally by providing to its customers, comprised of the Company’s homebuilding subsidiaries and most subcontractors of the Company’s homebuilding subsidiaries, general liability insurance on homes sold by our homebuilding subsidiaries and for work performed in completed subdivisions. Allegiant seeks to provide to its customers coverage and insurance rates that are competitive with other insurers. StarAmerican generates premium revenue by providing re-insurance coverage to Allegiant. Allegiant and StarAmerican incur expenses for actual losses and loss adjustment expenses and for reserves established based on actuarial studies including known facts, such as our experience with similar insurance cases and historical trends involving insurance claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid insurance claims, claim severity, claim frequency patterns and interpretations of circumstances including changing regulatory and legal environments.
Regulation. Allegiant and StarAmerican are licensed in the State of Hawaii and, therefore, are subject to regulation by the Hawaii Insurance Division. This regulation includes restrictions and oversight regarding: types of insurance provided; investment options; required capital and surplus; financial and information reporting; use of auditors, actuaries and other service providers; periodic examinations; and other operational items. Additionally, as a risk retention group, Allegiant is also registered in other states where certain MDC homebuilding subsidiaries do business.
