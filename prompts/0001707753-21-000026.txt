Item 1. Business.
Elastic is a search company. 
Search is foundational to a wide variety of experiences. Elastic makes the power of search—the ability to instantly find relevant information and insights from large amounts of data—available for a diverse set of applications and solutions, including Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security.
Elastic powers the search behind a ride sharing app to help locate nearby riders and drivers. Elastic powers the search for finding the right products to add to your cart for an ecommerce application. Elastic powers the search for a digital creative software company, enabling users to search across millions of digital assets to find the right photo, font, or color palette to complete a creative project. Elastic powers the logging of billions of events per day to track and manage website performance issues and network outages of a telecommunications company with nationwide networks of mobile subscribers. Elastic powers the processing of terabytes of daily data in real time to monitor the usage of thousands of servers for a financial services company across their entire IT environments. Elastic powers a university’s cybersecurity operations to protect thousands of devices and critical data. All of this is search.
Why we search remains constant: we’re looking for insight, information, and answers. But how and what we search changes over time, from the Dewey Decimal System for libraries to Google for the World Wide Web to conversations with virtual assistants for everyday inquiries. Today, what we search has grown to include a rapidly increasing amount of structured and unstructured data from a multitude of sources such as databases, websites, applications, and mobile and connected devices. While search experiences often begin with search boxes, they are not confined to them. Dragging your finger across a map on a smartphone screen is search. Zooming into a specific time frame in a histogram is search. Mining log files for errors is search. Forecasting storage capacity two weeks into the future is search. Using natural language processing to analyze user sentiment is search.
Elastic created the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source, and in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization in milliseconds or less. Developers build on top of the Elastic Stack to apply the power of search to their data and solve business problems. We have also built software solutions on the Elastic Stack that address a wide variety of use cases: Elastic Enterprise Search for workplace search, app search and site search, Elastic Observability for logging, metrics and application performance management (“APM”), and Elastic Security for security information and event management (“SIEM”) and endpoint security. 
The Elastic Stack and our solutions are designed to run in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments. As the technology landscape shifts, our products grow and adapt. In that sense, we believe that our company is truly elastic. 
Our origins are rooted in open source, which facilitates rapid adoption of our software and enables efficient distribution of our technology. Developers can either download or deploy our software directly in the cloud as a managed offering on our website, for use in development and production environments. Our offerings include both free and paid products and solutions. 
Our business model is based on a combination of free and paid proprietary software. For self-managed users who download our products, we make some of the proprietary features of our software available for free. Other proprietary features are only available through paid subscriptions, which also include access to support on all free and paid features. We also provide our software as a service (“SaaS”). There is no free subscription tier in our SaaS offerings. Unlike some open source companies, we do not build a separate enterprise version of an original open source project. Instead, we develop and test one robust codebase, over which we maintain control. We believe that maintaining full control over the source code enables us to develop better products for our users and customers. Our sales and marketing efforts start with developers and other users who have already adopted our software and then evolve to departmental decision-makers and senior executives who have broad purchasing power in their organizations. All of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model.
Our customers often significantly expand their usage of our products over time. Expansion includes increasing the number of developers using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and applying our products to new use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging these types of expansion within our customer base. 
Our business has experienced rapid growth around the world. As of April 30, 2021, we had over 15,000 customers compared to over 11,300 customers and over 8,100 customers as of April 30, 2020 and April 30, 2019, respectively. Our revenue was $608.5 million in the year ended April 30, 2021, $427.6 million in the year ended April 30, 2020, and $271.7 million in the year ended April 30, 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 42% and 57% for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Subscriptions accounted for 93%, 92% and 91% of our total revenue in the years ended 
April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue from outside the United States accounted for 45%, 43% and 43% of our total revenue in the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
In the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $129.4 million, $167.2 million and $102.3 million, respectively. For the year ended April 30, 2021, our cash provided by operating activities was $22.5 million, and for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, our cash used in operating activities was $30.6 million and $23.9 million, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. 
Our Products
We founded Elastic to bring the power of search to a broad range of business and consumer use cases. Our products enable our users and customers to instantly find relevant information and insights in large amounts of data.
We offer the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source, in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization, usually in milliseconds. The Elastic Stack can be used by developers to power a variety of use cases. We also offer software solutions built in the Elastic Stack that address a wide variety of use cases. The Elastic Stack and our solutions are designed to run in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments.
The Elastic Stack
The Elastic Stack is primarily composed of the following products:
•Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack. It is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine and datastore for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.
•Kibana. Kibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It is the visualization layer for data stored in Elasticsearch. It is also the management and configuration interface for all parts of the Elastic Stack.
The Elastic Stack also supports data ingest with a number of supporting products:
•Logstash. Logstash is the dynamic data processing pipeline for ingesting data into Elasticsearch or other storage systems from a multitude of sources simultaneously.
•Beats. Beats is the family of lightweight, single-purpose data shippers for sending data from edge machines to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
•Elastic Agent. Elastic Agent, currently in beta, is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each host. Elastic Agent includes integrated host protection and central management.
Some features of the Elastic Stack are free and open, available to users at no cost, while others require paid subscriptions. Paid proprietary features enable capabilities such as automating anomaly detection on time series data at scale through machine learning, facilitating compliance with data security and privacy regulations, supporting search across low cost cold and frozen data tiers, and allowing real-time notifications and alerts. The source code of both free and paid features in the Elastic Stack is visible to the public in the form of “open code.”
Our Solutions
We have built a number of solutions on top of the Elastic Stack to make it easier for organizations to use our software for common use cases. Like the Elastic Stack, our solutions comprise a combination of free and open features, and paid proprietary features. Our solutions include:
•Enterprise Search.  Our Enterprise Search solution provides powerful search for documents and results living in websites, applications and workplaces. Enterprise Search includes: Workplace Search, a unified search platform for the workplace that seamlessly connects to the most widely used enterprise systems and tools; App Search, a flexible, API-driven tool for building search experiences to support websites and portals, e-commerce, mobile app search, and customer support; and Site Search, an easy way to bring powerful search to any website.
•Observability.  Our Observability solution enables unified analysis across the IT ecosystem of applications, networks, and infrastructure. Observability includes: Logs, to search and analyze petabytes of structured and unstructured logs; Metrics, to search and analyze numeric and time series data; APM, to deliver insight into application performance and health metrics and provide developers with confidence in their code; and Uptime, to easily track and monitor the availability of hosts, websites, services and applications.
•Security.  Our Security solution provides unified protection to prevent, detect, and respond to threats. Security includes: SIEM, with integrations to network, host, user, and cloud data sources, as well as workflow and 
operations, shareable analytics, incident management, and investigations; and Endpoint Security, for prevention, detection and response in a single, stack-integrated agent.
Our Deployment Options
The Elastic Stack and our solutions generally can be deployed in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments, to satisfy various user and customer needs. 
•Self-Managed. Today, most users manage their own deployments of the Elastic Stack and our solutions. To help with more complex deployment scenarios, we offer Elastic Cloud Enterprise and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes, paid proprietary products, to deliver centralized provisioning, management, and monitoring across multiple deployments.
•SaaS. Many customers are becoming increasingly interested in SaaS deployment alternatives that reduce the burden of administration. For these customers we have developed a family of SaaS products called Elastic Cloud, which includes Elasticsearch Service and Site Search Service. We host and manage our Elastic Cloud products on infrastructure from multiple public cloud providers.
Our Business Model 
Our business model refers to how we make our software available, including our free and open distribution and go-to-market strategy, and how we charge our customers. We believe our business model creates significant value for our users, our customers, and our company. 
Our business model is based on a combination of free and paid proprietary software. We market and distribute the Elastic Stack and our solutions using a free and open distribution strategy. Developers and other users are able to download our software directly from our website. Some features of our software can be used free of charge. Others are only available through paid subscriptions, which include access to proprietary features and support. These paid features can be unlocked with a simple license update, without the need to re-deploy the software. We also provide our software as a service, as part of Elastic Cloud. There is no free subscription tier in our Elastic Cloud offerings. The rate at which our customers purchase additional subscriptions and expand the value of existing subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including customers’ level of satisfaction with our products, the nature and size of the deployments, the desire to address additional use cases, and the perceived need for additional proprietary features. The source code of all Elastic Stack features is visible to the public in the form of “open code.”
Our distribution model facilitates rapid and efficient adoption, particularly by empowering individual developers and other users to download and use our software without payment, registration, or the friction of a formal sales interaction. It also fosters a vibrant developer community around our products and solutions, which drives adoption of our products and increased interaction among users. Further, this approach enables community review of our code and products, which allows us to improve the reliability and security of our software. We believe that the number of times our products have been downloaded and the size of our developer community are indicative of the benefits of our free and open strategy and the growth in adoption of our products. However, we generally do not have visibility into, and cannot accurately determine how often, our downloaded products are being actively used.
We have designed our strategy to avoid some of the risks associated with an open source model. One such risk relates to control over the direction and roadmap of our products. We maintain full control over the source code of our products and solutions. While community members may suggest changes to our products, only Elastic employees are able to commit changes to the codebase. Also, many of our free features have been historically distributed under a proprietary license. In February 2021, with the release of version 7.11 of the Elastic Stack, we changed the source code of Elasticsearch and Kibana that had previously been licensed under an open source license to be licensed under a proprietary license. Further, unlike some open source companies, we do not build a separate enterprise edition of an original open source project. Instead, we develop, maintain, and test a single robust codebase that is shared by our entire developer community. 
Some open source companies sell only support for software that they make available at no cost. We believe this can create misaligned incentives in that the support vendor benefits from low software quality. Accordingly, we focus on designing high-quality software products that include proprietary features and are easy to use and reliable. We include support only as part of our subscriptions. 
We believe in building products that provide value and appeal to the people who use them, including developers, architects, DevOps personnel, IT professionals, and security analysts. At the same time, a software company should be able to engage and build relationships with departmental or organizational leaders who make large technology purchasing decisions. At Elastic, we do both. 
Strengths of Our Products 
The strengths of our products include the following: 
•Speed. The Elastic Stack can find matches for search criteria in milliseconds within even the largest structured and unstructured datasets. Its schema-less structure and inverted indices enable real-time search of high volumes of structured, unstructured, and time series data. 
•Scale. The Elastic Stack is a distributed system and can scale massively. It has the ability to subdivide search indices into multiple pieces called shards, which enables data volume to be scaled horizontally and operations to be distributed across hundreds of systems or more. A developer running hundreds of nodes has the same user experience as a developer running a single node on a laptop. 
•Relevance. Elasticsearch uses multiple analytical techniques to determine the similarity between stored data and queries, generating highly relevant results reflecting a deep understanding of text and context. Its sophisticated yet developer-friendly query language permits advanced search and analytics. Additionally, the speed of the Elastic Stack permits query iteration, further enhancing the relevance of search results. 
•Ease of Use. The Elastic Stack is engineered to take a user from data to dashboard or inquiry to insight in minutes. It offers an easy getting started experience, featuring streamlined download and deployment, sensible defaults, a simple and intuitive query language that just works, and no need to define a schema up front. Administrative tasks such as securing the Elastic Stack are intuitive and integrated into the user experience, as are investigative tasks such as data visualization. 
•Flexibility. The Elastic Stack is able to ingest, filter, store, search, and analyze data in any form, whether structured or unstructured. These capabilities enable the Elastic Stack to generate insights from a wide variety of data sources for a range of use cases. The flexibility of the Elastic Stack also enables users to begin using our products along with their existing systems, which lowers barriers to adoption. 
•Extensibility. Developers can use the Elastic Stack as a foundation for addressing a wide variety of use cases. Our open approach to building the Elastic Stack empowers developers to innovate and utilize it to fit their specific needs. Additionally, our developer community actively engages with us to improve and expand the Elastic Stack. 
Our Growth Strategies 
We intend to pursue the following growth strategies: 
•Increase product adoption by improving ease of use and growing our user community. With our engineering efforts focused on the user experience, we will continue to develop software that makes our products easier to use and adopt for both developers and non-developers. We will continue to engage with developers globally through a wide range of touch points such as community meetups, global community groups, hackathons, our global events, which we call ElasticON, and engagement on our website, user forums, and code repositories, to grow our user community. 
•Expand our customer base by acquiring new customers.  Through our distribution model, self-managed users can easily download our software directly from our website and access many features free of charge, which facilitates rapid adoption. Through Elastic Cloud, our SaaS offering, we provide the fastest and easiest way to get started with a free trial. However, there is no free subscription tier in Elastic Cloud. Our sales and marketing team conducts campaigns to drive further awareness and adoption within the user community. As a result, many of our sales prospects are already familiar with our technology prior to entering into a commercial relationship with us. Additionally, we leverage our network of partners to drive awareness and expand our sales and marketing reach to target new customers. We will continue to engage our community and our partners to drive awareness and to invest in our sales and marketing team to grow our customer base. 
•Expand within our existing customer base through new use cases and larger deployments. We often enter an organization through a single developer or a small team for an initial project or use case with an objective to quickly solve a technical challenge or business problem. Because of the rapid success with our products, knowledge of Elastic often spreads within an organization to new teams of developers, architects, IT operations personnel, security personnel, and senior executives. We will continue to invest in helping users and customers be successful with our products, and we view initial success with our products as a path to drive expansion to new use cases and projects and larger deployments within organizations. 
•Extend our product leadership through continued investment in our technology.  We will continue to invest in our self-managed and SaaS products to extend into new use cases, industries, geographies, and customers. 
•Increase usage of Elastic Cloud.  We believe that providing our SaaS products represents a significant growth opportunity. We plan to expand Elastic Cloud geographically and through more public cloud providers. We plan to continue to invest resources in increasing the adoption of Elastic Cloud. 
•Expand our strategic and regional partnerships. Our partners assist us in driving awareness of Elastic and our products, building new solutions on top of the Elastic Stack to solve customer pain points, and extending our reach in geographic areas and verticals where we do not have a formal sales presence. We have a diverse range of partners and we will continue to pursue partnerships to further the development of the Elastic Stack and our customer reach. 
•Selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments. We have selectively pursued acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses and technologies in order to drive product and market expansion. Since inception, we have acquired technology underlying our security offerings (formerly Endgame), Site Search and App Search offerings (formerly Swiftype), our APM offering (formerly Opbeat), our machine learning feature (formerly Prelert), our Beats product (formerly Packetbeat), our Elastic Cloud SaaS offering (formerly Found) and our Kibana and Logstash products through strategic transactions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and strategic investments selectively.
Customers
Organizations of all sizes, across many industries, both private and public, purchase our products for a variety of use cases. As of April 30, 2021, we had over 15,000 customers. No customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in the year ended April 30, 2021. 
Engineering 
Our engineering organization focuses on enhancing existing products and developing new products, both open source and proprietary, that are easy to use and can be run in any environment including in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments. With a distributed engineering team spanning over 30 countries, we are able to recruit, hire, and retain high-quality, experienced developers, tech leads, and product managers, and operate at a rapid pace to drive product releases, fix bugs, and create new product offerings. 
Our software development process is based on iterative releases across the Elastic Stack, our solutions, and Elastic Cloud. We are organized in small functional teams with a high degree of autonomy and accountability. Our distributed and highly modular team structure and well-defined software development processes also allow us to successfully incorporate technologies that we have acquired. 
 We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our products. Research and development expense totaled $199.2 million and $165.4 million, in the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We plan to continue to devote significant resources to research and development. 
Sales and Marketing 
We make it easy for individual developers to begin using our products in order to drive viral adoption. Users can download our software directly from our website without any sales interaction, and immediately begin using the full set of free and paid features. Access to our paid features is available for an initial trial period for both self-managed and SaaS subscriptions. 
As a result of our free and open strategy, our sales prospects are often already using our technology. Our sales and marketing efforts extend our free and open strategy in two key ways. First, we conduct low-touch marketing campaigns to keep users and customers engaged after they download our software. This includes providing high-quality content, documentation, webinars, videos, and blogs through our website. Second, we conduct high-touch virtual and field campaigns with qualified prospects and customers who have typically already deployed our software to drive further awareness, adoption, and expansion of our products and solutions. 
Our sales teams are segmented primarily by geography and secondarily by employee count in relation to our prospects and customers. We rely on inside sales development representatives to qualify leads based on their likelihood to make a purchase. We pursue sales opportunities primarily through a direct sales motion, in some cases assisted by partners. Our relationships within customer organizations often extend beyond the initial users of the technology and include technology and business decision-makers at various levels. We also engage with our customers on an ongoing basis through a customer success team, to ensure customer satisfaction and expand their usage of our technology. 
Partners
We maintain partner relationships that help us market and deliver our products to our customers and complement our community. Our partner relationships include the following:
•Cloud providers. We work with many of the major cloud providers to increase awareness of our products and make it easy to access our software. We partner with Google and Microsoft to offer our Elasticsearch Service (part of Elastic Cloud) on Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”), and Microsoft Azure, respectively, including direct purchase from us and through their respective marketplaces. We also partner with other cloud providers to provide our free and paid proprietary features to users on their cloud platforms. In addition, we make our Elasticsearch Service available on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), for direct purchase or through the AWS marketplace. Elastic’s Elasticsearch Service is a different offering than Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We do not partner with Amazon, provide support for Amazon Elasticsearch Service, or provide Amazon or customers of Amazon Elasticsearch Service with access to any of our free or paid proprietary features.
•Systems integrators, channel partners, and referral partners. We have a global network of systems integrators, channel partners, and referral partner relationships that help deliver our products to various business and government customers around the world.
•OEM and MSP partners. Our original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”), and managed service provider (“MSP”), partners embed an Elastic subscription into the products or services they offer to their own customers. OEM or MSP partners are able to include Elastic’s paid and unpaid proprietary features in their product, receive ongoing support from Elastic for product development, and receive support for end customer issues related to Elastic.
•Technology partners.  Our technology partners collaborate with Elastic to create a standardized solution for end users that includes technology from both Elastic and the partner. For example, we work with Micro Focus to integrate our products with their ArcSight product. Technology partners represent a deeper collaboration than community contributions and are distinct from distribution-oriented relationships like OEMs and MSP partners.
Professional Services 
We offer consulting and training as part of our offerings. To assist customers in accelerating their success with our software, our consulting team consists of engineers and architects who bring hands-on experience and deep technical knowledge to a project. Our training offerings enable our users to gain the necessary skills to develop, deploy, and manage our software. 
Customer Support
We endeavor to make it easy for users to download, install, deploy and use the Elastic Stack and our solutions. To this end, our user community functions as a source of support and enables users to engage in self-help and collaboration. 
However, in many situations, such as those involving complex enterprise IT environments, large deployments and novel use cases, our users require our support. Accordingly, we include support as part of the subscriptions we sell for our products. Our global support organization consists of highly technical support engineers who provide support experiences including troubleshooting, technical audits, cluster tuning, and upgrade assistance. Our support team is distributed across over 20 countries and provides coverage 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, across multiple languages. 
We believe that software companies should not have incentives to build low quality software. In that connection, we do not sell support separately from our software subscriptions. 
Our Technology 
Our products consist of the Elastic Stack, our solutions and software that supports our various deployment alternatives. Because our solutions are built on the Elastic Stack, innovations and new capabilities built into the Elastic Stack may benefit many of our solutions. Our customers can customize and extend our solutions to fit their needs by leveraging the power of the Elastic Stack and our developer capabilities.
Technology Features of the Elastic Stack
Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack, where users store, search, and analyze data. Key features of Elasticsearch include the following:
•Store any type of data.  Elasticsearch combines powerful parts of traditional search engines, such as an inverted index to power fast full text search and a column store for analytics, with native support for a wide range of data types, including text, dates, numbers, geospatial data, date/numeric ranges, and IP addresses. With sensible defaults, and no upfront schema definition necessary, Elasticsearch makes it easy to start simple and fine-tune as datasets grow.
•Powerful query languages.  The Elasticsearch query domain specific language is a flexible, expressive search language that exposes a rich set of query capabilities across any kind of data. From simple Boolean operators to custom relevance functions, users can articulate exactly what they are looking for and bring their own definition of relevance. The query language also includes a composable aggregation framework that enables users to summarize, slice, and analyze structured or semi-structured datasets across multiple dimensions. Examples of these capabilities include tracking the top ten users by spend, looking at data week over week, analyzing data across geographies, and drilling down into details with specific filters all with a single search. 
•Developer friendliness.  Elasticsearch has consistent, well-documented APIs that work the same way on one node during initial development as on a hundred nodes in production. Elasticsearch also ships with a number of language clients that provide a natural way to integrate with a variety of popular programming frameworks, reducing the learning curve, and leading to a shorter time to realizing value.
•High speed. Everything stored in Elasticsearch is indexed by default, such that users do not need to decide in advance what queries they will want to run. Our architecture optimizes throughput, time-to-data availability and query latency. Elasticsearch can easily index millions of events per second, and newly added data can be available for search nearly instantly.
•High scale and availability. Elasticsearch is designed to scale horizontally and be resilient to node or hardware failures. As nodes join a cluster, data is automatically re-balanced and queries and indexing are spread across the new nodes seamlessly. This makes it easy to add hardware to increase indexing throughput or improve query throughput. Elasticsearch also detects node failures and hardware or network issues and automatically protects user data by ejecting the failing or inaccessible nodes and creating new replicas of the data.
•Machine learning and alerting. Machine learning capabilities such as anomaly detection, forecasting, and categorization are tightly integrated with the Elastic Stack to automatically model the behavior of data, such as trends and periodicity, in real time in order to identify issues faster, streamline root cause analysis, and reduce false positives. Without these capabilities, it can be very difficult to identify issues such as infrastructure problems or intruders in real time across complex, high-volume, fast-moving datasets.
•Security. Security features give administrators the rights to grant specific levels of access to their various types of users, such as IT, operations, and application teams. Elasticsearch serves as the central authentication hub for the entire Elastic Stack. Security features include encrypted communications and encryption-at-rest; role-based access control; single sign-on and authentication; field-level, attribute-level, and document-level security; and audit logging.
Kibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It allows users to manage the Elastic Stack and visualize data. Additionally, the interfaces for many of our solutions are built into Kibana. Key features of Kibana include the following:
•Explore and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch. Kibana provides interactive data views, visualizations, and dashboards powered by structured filtering and unstructured search to enable users to get to answers more quickly. A variety of data visualization types, such as simple line and bar charts, purpose-built geospatial and time series visualizations, tree diagrams, network diagrams, heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms, support diverse user needs. 
•Incorporate advanced analytics and machine learning from Elasticsearch. Kibana’s query, filtering, and data summarization capabilities reflect Elasticsearch’s powerful query domain specific language and aggregation framework while making it interactive.
•Manage the Elastic Stack. Kibana presents a broad user interface showing the health of Elastic Stack components and provides cluster alerts to notify administrators of problems. Its central management user interfaces (UIs) make it easier to operate the Elastic Stack at scale.
•Home for Solutions. Kibana is where our users and customers access the user interfaces for our Observability and Security solutions. Kibana provides core services, like security, alerting, and data visualization components. This makes it easy for users to discover all of the capabilities our solutions provide, and enables solution users to benefit from the core capabilities of the Kibana. 
•Application framework.  Kibana is designed to be extensible. Users interested in a highly specialized visualization type not distributed with Kibana by default can customize experiences through a Kibana plugin and make the plugin available to the community. Dozens of Kibana plugins have been shared by the community via Elastic documentation and code sharing platforms such as GitHub.
Beats, Elastic Agent, and Logstash are data ingestion tools that enable users to collect and enrich any kind of data from any source for storage in Elasticsearch. Beats and Logstash have an extensible modular architecture. Beats are lightweight agents purpose-built for collecting data on devices, servers, and inside containers. Elastic Agent, currently in beta, is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each host, and also includes integrated host protection. Key features of Beats and Elastic Agent include the following:
•Data shippers.  Beats are lightweight agents built for the purposes of efficient data collection at the edge for specific types of data, such as Filebeat for the collection of logging data, Metricbeat for the collection of system or service metric data, Auditbeat for the collection of security data, Packetbeat for the collection of network data, and Heartbeat for the collection of availability data. Dozens of community Beats enable the collection of data from specialized sources. Elastic Agent introduces a new single agent architecture across hosts that simplifies management and deployment.
•Extensibility and community Beats.  The Beats platform enables rapid creation of custom Beats that can be run on a variety of edge technologies for data collection. Over 90 Beats have been shared by the community via Elastic documentation and many more are available through code sharing platforms such as GitHub.
•Host protection. Specifically with Elastic Agent, we extend protection to hosts in addition to data transfer. Elastic Agent stops malware and ransomware and enables environment-wide visibility and advanced threat detection.
Logstash enables centralized collection and extract, transformation, and load capabilities. Key features of Logstash include the following:
•Data transformation engine.  Logstash is a centralized data transformation engine that can receive and pull data from multiple sources, transform and filter that data, and send it to multiple outputs. Logstash has a powerful and flexible configuration language that allows users to create data stream acquisition and transformation logic without having to write code. This greatly extends and accelerates the ability to create data management pipelines to a wide variety of organizations and individuals.
•Plugins. Logstash collects data from a variety of sources, such as network devices, queues, endpoints, and public cloud services. Logstash enriches the data via lookups against local data sources, such as a geolocation database, and remote data sources, such as relational databases. Logstash can output events to Elasticsearch or downstream queues and other datastores. We develop and support more than 80 plugins for many common integrations.
•Logstash extensibility and community plugins.  A vibrant community of users extends our reach through hundreds of community Logstash plugins that enable integration with a wide variety of data sources across many use cases.
Technology Features of Our Solutions
Our solutions are designed to minimize time-to-value and deployment costs of using the Elastic Stack for common use cases. The functionality of our solutions often includes specialized data collection, through standardized APIs or custom agents, and custom user interfaces for specific data analytics, visualizations, workflows, and actions. Most of our solutions can be self-managed or accessed through Elastic Cloud. 
Enterprise Search gives users the tools to bring search experiences to customers, partners and teams quickly and scale them seamlessly.
•Workplace Search. Workplace Search brings modern search to collaborative decisions and experiences. It seamlessly connects to some of the world’s most widely adopted productivity tools, customer relationship management platforms, cloud storage platforms, collaboration tools, operation management platforms, and content management systems. Custom sources provide an elegant set of APIs that lets customers and users ingest any type of content from even more sources while preserving access control information.

By querying logs in ad hoc ways, users can triage, troubleshoot, and resolve performance issues. 
•Metrics. Metrics ingests, searches, visualizes, and analyzes numeric and time series data from IT systems, including applications, datastores, hosts, containers, cloud infrastructure, and more. Users can review performance and utilization trends to optimize and plan for future needs. Metrics helps users deliver on infrastructure service level objectives (“SLOs”), and resolve downtime or performance issues by understanding how the state of individual components fits into the bigger picture.
•APM.  APM delivers insight into application performance at the code level. Developers can instrument apps and see the lifecycle of a transaction across services from front end to back end. This can give developers confidence in the code they ship, and can give operational teams visibility into code-level errors and performance bottlenecks to accelerate root cause analysis and resolution during an investigation.
•Uptime. Customers and users leverage Uptime to track and monitor the availability of the hosts, websites, services, and application endpoints that support business operations. Through proactive monitoring, customers can detect troublesome components before they are reported by end users.
Security delivers unified protection to prevent, detect, and respond to a variety of threats across the IT ecosystem.
•SIEM. Elastic SIEM automates threat detection and remediation, reducing mean time to detect (“MTTD”) and mean time to respond (“MTTR”). With prebuilt Beats integrations, SIEM can ingest data from cloud, network, endpoints, applications, and other systems. With Elastic Common Schema (“ECS”), users can centrally analyze information like logs, flows, and contextual data from disparate data sources. SIEM provides an interactive workspace for security teams to detect and respond to threats. Teams can triage events and perform investigations, gathering evidence on an interactive timeline. SIEM also streamlines opening and updating cases, forwarding potential incidents to security operations workflows and IT ticketing systems.
•Endpoint Security. Endpoint Security combines prevention, detection, and response into a single, autonomous agent that can even run in isolated environments. It is designed for ease of use and for speed, and can help stop threats in early stages of an attack. Endpoint Security includes protection against ransomware, malware, phishing, exploits, fileless attacks, and more. When deployed together, SIEM and Endpoint Security provide a strong security posture with broad visibility on potential threats.
Elastic Cloud, Elastic Cloud Enterprise, and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes 
The Elastic Stack and our solutions can be deployed in public or private clouds, in hybrid environments, or in traditional on-premises environments. We divide our deployment models into two categories: self-managed, which refers to users deploying the Elastic Stack and solutions on infrastructure they manage themselves (such as their own data center or private or public cloud environments), and Elastic Cloud, which refers to our SaaS products that we host and manage. To help self-managed users with more complex deployment scenarios, we offer Elastic Cloud Enterprise and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes. 
•Elastic Cloud. Elastic Cloud is our growing family of SaaS products and technologies that make it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elastic products and solutions in the cloud. Elastic Cloud products include Elasticsearch Service and Site Search Service and are offered by us on certain large cloud providers. 
•Elastic Cloud Enterprise and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes.  As part of building our Elastic Cloud offering, we built a comprehensive orchestration and administration infrastructure tool to easily provision, monitor, manage, secure, upgrade and backup the thousands of clusters that comprise our Elastic Cloud products. We then packaged this infrastructure into a downloadable and easily installable proprietary product called Elastic Cloud Enterprise, which makes this tool available to customers to use with their own self-managed deployments. Elastic Cloud Enterprise enables our customers to provision, monitor, manage, secure, upgrade and backup any number of 
clusters. It also helps our customers improve their hardware utilization and operational efficiency by allowing them to leverage shared hardware resources to manage multiple clusters, while still maintaining a strong level of isolation between those clusters. More recently, we also launched Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes, extending our cloud orchestration capabilities to Kubernetes environments via the official Elasticsearch operator for Kubernetes.
Community 
Our team extends beyond our employee base. It includes all the users who download our software. Our users interact with us on our website forums and on Twitter, GitHub, Stack Overflow, Quora, Facebook, Weibo, WeChat, and more. 
In order to build products that best meet our users’ needs, we focus on, and invest in, building a strong community. Each download of the Elastic Stack is a new opportunity to educate our next contributor, hear about a new use case, explore the need for a new feature, or meet a future member of the team. Community is core to our identity, binding our products closely together with our users. Community gives us an ability to get their candid feedback, creating a direct line of communication between our users and the builders of our products across all of our features—including both free and paid capabilities—enabling us to make our products simpler and better. 
The Elastic community has a Code of Conduct. It covers the behaviors of the Elastic community in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, code repository, IRC channel, private correspondence, or public meeting. It is designed to ensure that the Elastic community is a space where members and users can freely and openly communicate, collaborate, and contribute both ideas and code. It also covers our community ground rules: be considerate, be patient, be respectful, be nice, communicate effectively, and ask for help when unsure. 
Competition 
Our market is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new offerings. Our principal competitors include: 
•For Enterprise Search (app search, site search, and workplace search): incumbent offerings such as Solr (open source offering), Lucidworks Fusion, search tools including Google Custom Search Engine (an advertisement-based site search tool with limited user controls), and workplace search tools including Coveo, Endeca (acquired by Oracle) and Autonomy (acquired by HP and now offered by Micro Focus). 
•For Observability (logging, metrics, APM, and uptime monitoring): software vendors with specific observability solutions to analyze logging data, metrics, APM data, or infrastructure uptime, such as Splunk, New Relic, Dynatrace, AppDynamics (owned by Cisco Systems) and Datadog. 
•For Security (SIEM and endpoint security): security analytics solutions vendors such as Splunk and Azure Sentinel (offered by Microsoft) and endpoint security vendors such as CrowdStrike, Carbon Black (acquired by VMware), McAfee and Symantec (acquired by Broadcom).
•Certain cloud hosting providers and managed service providers, including Amazon Web Services, that offer products based on older Elastic Stack releases. These offerings are not supported by Elastic and come without any of Elastic’s proprietary features, whether free or paid. 
The principal competitive factors for companies in our industry are: 
•product capabilities, including speed, scale, and relevance, with which to power search experiences; 
•an extensible product “stack” that enables developers to build a wide variety of solutions; 
•powerful and flexible technology that can manage a broad variety and large volume of data; 
•ease of deployment and ease of use; 
•ability to address a variety of evolving customer needs and use cases; 
•strength of sales and marketing efforts; 
•flexible deployment model across public or private clouds, hybrid environments, or traditional on-premises environments; 
•productized solutions engineered to be rapidly adopted to address specific applications; 
•mindshare with developers and IT executives; 
•adoption of products by many types of users (developers, architects, DevOps personnel, IT professionals, security analysts, and departmental and organizational leaders); 
•enterprise-grade technology that is secure and reliable; 
•size of customer base and level of user adoption; 
•quality of training, consulting, and customer support; 
•brand awareness and reputation; and 
•low total cost of ownership. 
We believe that we compare favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks and presence, more established relationships with current or potential customers and partners, more diverse product and services offerings and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets. While our products and solutions have various competitors across different use cases, such as app search, site search, workplace search, logging, metrics, APM, business analytics and security analytics, we believe that few competitors currently have the capabilities to address our entire range of use cases. We believe our industry requires constant change and innovation, and we plan to continue to evolve search as a foundational technology to solve the problems of today and new emerging problems in the future. 
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual measures to safeguard our core technology and other intellectual property assets. In addition, we maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, and consultants to enter into disclosure and invention assignment agreements. As of April 30, 2021, we had 24 issued patents in the United States with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2039, 57 pending U.S. patent applications, and 17 pending non-U.S. patent filings. The pending patent applications, if issued, would expire between 2032 and 2041. In addition, as of April 30, 2021, we had 38 registered trademarks in the United States, 2 pending trademark applications in the United States, as well as 326 registered trademarks in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and no pending trademark applications in various non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The laws, procedures and restrictions on which we rely may provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Business.” 
In addition, our technology incorporates software components licensed to the general public under open source software licenses such as the Apache Software License Version 2.0. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source components of our technology. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute our platform. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. 
Human Capital Management
Our employees (whom we call “Elasticians”) and our culture are vital to Elastic’s long-term success. Our human capital management efforts are focused on:
•Attracting, engaging and retaining talent
•Maintaining our strong company culture
•Enhancing our diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”)
•Continuing strong employee engagement
•Facilitating continuous employee learning and development
•Offering effective total rewards, including employee well-being
Our management regularly updates our board of directors and its committees on human capital trends and employee-focused activities and initiatives.
As of April 30, 2021, we had a total of 2,179 employees in over 35 countries globally, including 946 employees located outside of the United States. In addition, approximately 30% of our workforce encompasses women and non-binary employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. In certain countries in which we operate, such as France and Spain, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages. 
Our Culture
We describe our culture by the Elastic “source code,” the things that make Elastic, Elastic. Our source code guides our culture, business, product development, people practices and brand. The guiding ideas are:
•Home, Dinner. There is no such thing as work-life balance. We are successful if we find balance in life. Elastic empowers its employees with the flexibility to do so. Be home for dinner, go for a run midday, care for a sick child, or visit a parent. Finding balance means being more innovative and efficient at work. Which makes for a better Elastic.
•Space, Time.  It’s easy to get stuck in a day-to-day work pattern. Allowing for the space and time to dream requires conscious effort. Embracing a high failure rate does, too. Fulfillment comes from doing the obvious and dreaming up the un-obvious. Both are foundations of Elastic.
•IT, Depends.  It’s pretty complicated to make some things simple, and even more complicated to make other things possible. We embrace and value the knowledge required to do both. When a question is asked, buckle up. Sh*t is about to get real. Your journey will likely start with “it depends.”
•Progress, SIMPLE Perfection. Perfection is not a destination. Color inside the lines or color outside the lines. Just pick a color. It’s as simple as 2048. An Elastic that moves is an Elastic that survives, thrives, and stands the test of time.
•01.02, /FORMAT.  Our products are distributed by design, our company is distributed by intention. With many languages, perspectives, and cultures, it’s easy to lose something in translation. Over email and chat, doubly so. Until we get a perpetual empathy machine, don’t assume malice. A distributed Elastic makes for a diverse Elastic, which makes for a better Elastic.
•As YOU, Are.  We all come in different shapes with different interests and skills. We all have an accent. Celebrate it. Just come as you are. No need to invest neurons trying to fit an arbitrary mold. We’d rather you put them to work shaping Elastic.
•HUMBLE, Ambitious.  Ambition drives us to challenge ourselves and the people around us to do better. It is not an excuse to be an *sshole. Be humble. Be ambitious. At Elastic, we are both.
•Speed, SCALE, Relevance. Elastic is a search company. We focus on value to users by producing fast results that operate at scale and are relevant. This is our DNA. We believe search is an experience. It is what defines us, binds us, and makes us unique.
Elastic was born a distributed company and continues to be distributed by design. We have designed our processes, systems, and teams so that employees can generally perform their jobs without needing to be physically present in the same room or even in the same time zone. Just as distributed systems are more resilient, we believe that being distributed helps build a strong company that can scale and adapt as new challenges arise. Having a distributed workforce gives us a global candidate pool, which gives us the opportunity to cast a wider recruiting net, a critical aspect of helping open our pipelines to a broader set of diverse talent. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Our focus on DEI is critical to how we develop, strengthen and sustain a sense of belonging and inclusion among all Elasticians. 
 Balanced Teams. We strive to be an employer of choice for a diverse and inclusive workforce through our talent brand, talent attraction, development, and retention efforts. Our recruiting approach is underpinned by the desire to create balanced teams at Elastic, which includes considering broad aspects of diversity from race and gender mix as well as diversity of thought, experience and tenure when recruiting new team members. In fiscal year 2021, the created-by-women-for-women workplace review site, Fairygodboss, recognized Elastic as number one in the Best Technology Company for Women category, and as one of the best workplaces for women in two additional categories: Best Company for Women, and Best Company Where CEOs Support Gender Diversity. 
Elastician Resource Groups. We strive to embed DEI deep within our culture through various initiatives, projects and programs, the centerpiece of which is the Elastician Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which are organizationally sponsored, self-organized, Elastician-run groups. Aligned to specific shared identities, interests, affinity or allyship, such as Latinx, parent(s), disability or accessibility, Black, LGBTQ+ and others, each group identifies goals and objectives with executive sponsorship to ensure that they provide tangible benefits and result in all Elasticians feeling a sense of belonging. 
Code of Conduct. All of our employees must adhere to a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”) that sets standards for appropriate behavior and are required to complete annual training on the Code of Conduct and training to help prevent, identify and report any type of discrimination and harassment.
Employee Engagement
We are committed to ensuring that Elasticians have a voice in how we can collectively make Elastic a better place to work.
New Employee Onboarding. Our new employee onboarding experience is centered around attending “X-School”, our extensive new-hire orientation program, which enables new Elasticians to meet and collaborate with other new Elasticians from around the globe and to learn about our products and solutions.
Engagement Surveys. We maintain a regular pulse on how our employees are feeling through two primary feedback mechanisms – an annual employee engagement survey and a mid-year pulse survey check-in. The results of these surveys are reviewed at the company, functional, team and manager level, with action plans put in place annually. Elasticians were highly engaged in providing feedback in fiscal year 2021, with very high participation rates for the mid-year and annual surveys as well as high engagement scores across a spectrum of questions. 
Learning and Development
Our Learning & Organizational Development team’s mission to enable Elasticians to pursue their purpose, in work and life, makes for a better Elastic. To that end, we have a variety of ways in which we support the continuous learning and development of all Elasticians, including access to on-demand video based learning.
We also conduct specific programs to develop managers and leaders at Elastic, including our flagship Leadership Performance Program, an externally-led program focused on high-performing leaders who have the potential to have a significant strategic impact on the achievement of our long-term objectives. 
Total Rewards
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being. We provide market competitive compensation which typically includes cash compensation as well as equity awards. Reflecting our interest in the whole person, we provide programs designed to enable Elasticians to meet their well-being goals, from starting a family to being at their physical and emotional best. These programs include market competitive medical and dental programs, in addition to focus on mental health and holistic well-being. We provide market competitive paid time off (“PTO”) programs, including offering 16 weeks of paid leave to all new parents. In addition, we also provide retirement and income protection plans, which include a 401k plan with a dollar-for-dollar match by Elastic up to 6% of eligible earnings up to a plan-limit maximum for U.S.-based Elasticians as well as similar competitive plans outside of the United States. 
Fair Pay. We have fair and consistent compensation practices through our use of local third-party market data specific to each country, where available, so that we understand local compensation and cost of labor levels. We retain external experts to review our compensation outcomes on an ongoing basis to ensure they are bias-free and fairly reward employee performance and contributions. We take great pride in our focus on fair pay and the positive results we’ve established. Our external review continues to validate that we have gender-based pay parity between male and female Elasticians globally.
Community Involvement. Through Elastic Cares, employees can support the charitable organizations that matter the most to them on a local and global level. Elastic Cares is a program consisting of donation matching, our nonprofit organization program which provides our technology for free to certain nonprofit organizations, and our volunteer time off (“VTO”) initiative. Employees are encouraged to volunteer for these organizations throughout the year using our VTO program which provides our employees with 40 hours of volunteer time each year.
COVID-19 Response
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary focus was and continues to be on the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we closed our offices globally and required our employees to 
work remotely. Additionally, due to concerns over risks related to travel and large gatherings, we have replaced our in-person events, including our internal global all-hands, annual flagship conference and other in-person marketing events, with web-based virtual events. Given the significant personal and professional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided reimbursements for home office equipment and established specific learning opportunities for our employees that allowed teams to better connect to each other, including fun activities to help teams bond. To allow employees to deal with and alleviate the physical, mental, and emotional effects of the pandemic on themselves and loved ones, we offered two weeks of COVID leave and implemented company-wide days off called “Shut it Down Days” twice per month. 
Government Regulations
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory Matters” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K” for a discussion of these potential impacts.
