Overview
Evelo Biosciences is discovering and developing a new class of orally delivered investigational medicines that are intended to act on cells in the small intestine to produce therapeutic effects throughout the body. The target cells in the small intestine play a central role in governing human immune, metabolic and neurologic systems. We refer to this biology as the small intestinal axis, or SINTAX™. We have built a platform to discover and develop novel oral medicines which target the small intestinal axis. By harnessing the small intestinal axis, we have the potential to transform healthcare via medicines that have the potential to be effective, safe, convenient and affordable and to thereby treat patients at all stages of diseases and to treat patients globally.
Our first product candidates are orally delivered pharmaceutical preparations of naturally occurring, specific single strains of microbes. In preclinical models, our product candidates engaged immune cells in the small intestine and drove changes in systemic biology without any observed systemic exposure. We have observed in early clinical trials and preclinical studies that our approach led to modulated immune responses throughout the body by acting on the small intestinal axis. Our most advanced product candidate, EDP1815 is being developed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and the hyperinflammatory response associated with COVID-19. Additional product candidates include EDP1867 and EDP2939 for the treatment of inflammatory disease and EDP1908 for the treatment of cancer.
Orally delivered SINTAX medicines have the potential to address patient needs at all stages of disease due to their potentially superior characteristics over current therapies:
•In preclinical models, our product candidates have acted through multiple clinically relevant and validated biological pathways. By acting on multiple pathways simultaneously, we believe our product candidates could impact disease in ways that are not possible with current single-target or dual-target therapies.
•Our data suggest that our product candidates for inflammatory diseases have the potential to resolve disease causing inflammation whilst preserving immunity, a significant potential benefit. Anti-inflammatory therapies often cause significant immune suppression.
•We believe our product candidates are likely to be well-tolerated as they are derived from naturally occurring, specific single commensal strains of human bacteria, have not shown systemic exposure in clinical trials, and have been cleared from the body with no colonization of the gut.
•Our products candidates are formulated as oral medicines, which many patients prefer over injectable biologics and burdensome application of topical drugs.
•We have developed robust manufacturing processes for our product candidates, allowing for large-scale production and the potential for global, room-temperature stable distribution of our product candidates at affordable prices.
•We believe our discovery and development of oral SINTAX medicines has the potential to be more efficient than other product classes such as cell therapy, monoclonal antibodies and small molecules. We believe that our product candidates will not require the lengthy target validation and compound discovery requirements of conventional drug discovery.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to create and develop a new class of therapies that has the potential to transform the treatment of a broad range of diseases by targeting SINTAX. 
Key elements of our strategy:
•Explore the full potential of SINTAX to create an expansive and diversified product portfolio. We believe targeting SINTAX has applicability across a broad range of disease areas and we are committed to pursuing opportunities in which our platform has the potential to transform their treatment. Our initial focus is on inflammatory diseases and oncology. We intend to expand into other disease areas, such as 
autoimmune diseases, respiratory diseases, neuro-inflammation and degeneration, liver diseases, type I diabetes, food allergy, neurobehavior, cardiovascular disease and diseases of metabolism.
•Develop best-in-class therapies to improve outcomes across various stages of disease. We intend to develop best-in-class orally delivered therapies and explore the potential of SINTAX medicines across the full spectrum of disease severity, including in patients with mild and moderate forms of disease. We intend to pursue what we believe to be the inherent advantages of SINTAX medicines to enable use in all stages of disease.
•Advance and scale our SINTAX medicine platform. We plan to continue to invest in our platform, which integrates microbiology, immunology and computational biology capabilities. We intend to expand the diversity of our microbial library and enhance our proprietary in vitro and in vivo assays to optimize selection of our future product candidates. Our manufacturing processes are designed to ensure the quality and scalability of our product candidates. We plan to continue to invest in novel methods for process development, manufacturing and formulation for our SINTAX medicine. In the future, we intend to invest in commercial scale manufacturing. We plan to leverage the efficiency of our integrated capabilities to accelerate the clinical development of product candidates.
•Strengthen and expand our intellectual property to protect our platform and product candidates. We have exclusive rights to our technologies including issued composition of matter and method of use patents in the United States for some of our product candidates. We intend to pursue patent protection for our scientific innovations and to maintain a strong and broad estate of patents and trade secrets in the United States and other geographies.
•Collaborate to realize the potential of SINTAX medicines. We intend to continue to seek collaborations with academic groups, biotech and pharmaceutical companies to realize the value of our broad platform and extend the range of our development activities and disease areas in a timely and cost-effective manner. We plan to commercialize products in multiple geographies both on our own and with collaborators.
The Immune System and the Use of Immunotherapy in Disease
Immunology and Current Immunotherapy
The immune system consists of many different cell types that act together as a coordinated system constantly scanning for, identifying and responding to both human and microbial signals. Immune cells, including different types of T-cells, circulate throughout the body via the lymphatic system searching for signs of disease or infection. When this immune surveillance is functioning correctly, immune cells recognize and destroy both pathogens and cancer cells. However, when the immune system responds excessively, diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis can result. Conversely, an inadequate immune system response may allow various types of cancer and infections to progress unchecked.
Advances in our understanding of how the immune system affects a broad spectrum of disease has resulted in the development of immunotherapies, which are medicines that reduce, suppress, elicit or amplify specific immune responses. Antibody-based immunotherapies for inflammatory diseases and oncology have fundamentally changed the treatment landscape for patients. For example, anti-TNFα antibodies are widely used to treat moderate to severe stages of many inflammatory diseases. In 2019, three of the fifteen top selling drugs worldwide were anti-TNFα antibodies, with HUMIRA alone generating worldwide annual net sales of $19.7 billion. In oncology, checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, including those targeting the programmed cell death protein/ligand 1, or PD-1/PD-L1 pathways, block the tumor’s ability to suppress the immune response. They have improved the treatment of many cancers and are expected as a class to reach peak annual net sales of $30 billion by 2025. While existing immunotherapies have been successful in treating inflammatory diseases and oncology, there remains a substantial unmet need for a majority of patients.
Emergence of a Broad New Opportunity in Immunotherapy
Until recently, immunotherapeutic approaches have largely ignored one of the body’s naturally-evolved routine immunological processes and its associated immune organ— the gut, and specifically the small intestine. Immunomodulation through the small intestine has the potential to address certain limitations of current immunotherapies by acting on multiple naturally evolved and clinically relevant pathways. We believe this novel 
approach presents advantages, including potentially minimizing adverse events, enhancing patient convenience and targeting multiple immune pathways simultaneously. We believe that a novel class of therapeutics with these attributes has the potential to be transformative in treating a broad range of immune-mediated diseases. Furthermore, we believe this approach could also expand the use of immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with earlier stages of disease.
SINTAX is Central to Human Biology and Immunology
The small intestine is the largest part of the immune system. Specific types of immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, are resident in the tissue of the small intestine. They sample specific contents in the interior of the small intestine, which is called the lumen. These immune cells then migrate to lymph nodes where they condition other important immune cells, including T-cells. These conditioned T-cells then travel throughout the body via the lymphatic system to impact disease. We believe SINTAX provides an opportunity for immunomodulation throughout the body after oral delivery of products that remain physically restricted to the lumen and lymphoid tissues of the gut. Immunomodulation via SINTAX may represent an underappreciated opportunity to drive therapeutically relevant immune responses throughout the body.
SINTAX and Microbes
Microbes in the human gut are single-cell organisms that have co-evolved with the human immune system. Many human immune cells are programmed to sense and respond to microbes that they contact in the small intestine. Research in mucosal immunology has revealed that microbial interactions in the small intestine can drive activity in SINTAX.
Multiple mechanisms for direct interactions between microbes and immune cells in the small intestine have been demonstrated. We believe that dendritic cells and macrophages in the lymphoid tissues of the small intestine are key target cells of immunomodulatory microbes. The small intestine has a large surface area and thin and diffuse mucus layer, which allows for close contact between microbes and immune cells. Dendritic cells are a specialized type of immune cell that survey the body’s tissues, detecting and presenting antigens to T-cells. Macrophages can take on many functional forms depending on the conditioning of their environment in the body and are important for both anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor immunity. Immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, can extend protrusions through junctions between epithelial cells in the lining of the small intestine. These protrusions come into direct contact with and sample the microbial contents of the small intestine lumen. These immune cells then migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes where they come into contact with T-cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages that have been primed by exposure to microbes in the gut, condition T-cells within the mesenteric lymph node and push them towards an inflammatory or immunoregulatory phenotype depending on the specific strain of the microbe. Conditioned T-cells continue to move through the body via the lymphatic system to other parts of the body where they may act in local tissue to modulate an immune response.
Figure 1: The small intestine and microbes. The small intestine is connected to many other parts of the body via the lymphatic system in green. The cross-section of the small intestine depicts (1) sampling of microbes in the small intestine by dendritic cells and macrophages, (2) conditioning of T-cells by dendritic cells and macrophages in the lymph node, and (3) migration of conditioned T-cells to other areas of the body.
Several of our academic collaborators have explored the functional consequences of the interactions between immune cells and single strains of microbes in the gut. Veena Taneja, Ph.D. and Joseph Murray M.D. of Mayo Clinic showed that an orally administered strain of Prevotella histicola modulated immune function in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. In the field of immuno-oncology, Thomas Gajewski, M.D., Ph.D. and his group at the University of Chicago conducted an experiment in which a single strain of orally administered Bifidobacterium had equivalent activity to an anti-PD-L1 antibody and additive activity in combination in a mouse model of melanoma. We believe these and other examples from the academic literature support our theory that single strains of microbes can act on SINTAX to suppress or activate immune responses throughout the body. Our Phase 1b clinical data to date also support this theory.
SINTAX medicines as a Potential New Class of Oral Biologic Medicines
Our company was founded to discover and develop therapies that act on SINTAX. We aim to develop therapies based on our observations on the central role of the small intestine in modulating immune activity throughout the body and the equally important role of microbes as key modulators of SINTAX.
We have developed the tools to isolate, select, and develop specific microbes that have historically been difficult to identify, isolate and culture. This extends from microbial isolation to manufacturing. We have developed proprietary insights and tools that enhance our ability to produce pharmaceutical compositions of microbes at scale. This allows us to deliver potentially therapeutic doses of appropriately formulated strains.
We are developing SINTAX medicines- whole, inactivated microbes and bacterial extracellular vesicles ("EVs") to engage cells in the small intestine and drive changes in systemic biology by either downregulating or upregulating immune responses for the treatment of disease. SINTAX medicines are orally delivered pharmaceutical compositions of specific strains of microbes or EVs from specific strains of microbes.
We believe key features and advantages of our SINTAX medicine candidates are:
•Single strain. Our product candidates are pharmaceutical compositions of single strains of microbes or EVs produced by single strains of microbes that we have selected for their specific immunomodulatory properties. We extensively characterize the ability of our product candidates to elicit a desired immunomodulatory effect.
•Orally administered formulation. We intend to deliver our initial product candidates orally in formulations designed for targeted release to specific regions within the small intestine. Patients typically prefer oral administration to intravenous infusion, subcutaneous injection, and topical administration, which we believe will facilitate the adoption of our SINTAX medicines, if approved.
•Limited systemic exposure. In preclinical studies, we observed that our product candidates had limited systemic exposure, that they cleared from the gut within 24 to 48 hours and that colonization was not required for beneficial activity. We believe that these factors suggest that SINTAX medicines may have limited systemic off-target side-effects. Our Phase 1b clinical data to date support this potential.
•Action on multiple clinically relevant and validated pathways. Our preclinical data have shown that SINTAX medicines may act simultaneously on multiple clinically relevant and validated biological pathways. The diseases we intend to treat are multifactorial, and we believe that our potential therapies will be advantageous over single-target treatments. Additionally, our data suggest that SINTAX medicines resolve inflammation whilst preserving immunity, a significant potential benefit compared to other anti-inflammatory therapies that often cause significant immune suppression.
Given these expected features, we believe that SINTAX medicines may have a number of advantages in comparison to other immunotherapies such as antibodies, cell therapies and small molecules.
SINTAX Medicine Platform
We have developed an integrated platform designed to identify individual strains of microbes capable of modulating the immune system by acting on SINTAX when administered at pharmacologically active doses and appropriately formulated. We use the process development and formulation capabilities of our platform to develop selected microbes as product candidates.
Our proprietary SINTAX platform is comprised of the following four key areas:
Candidate discovery. We have assembled a proprietary library of diverse strains of microbes. The continuing accrual of strains in our library is from human mucosal and small intestinal sources in order to benefit from the co-evolution of microbes and the human immune system. We also add to our library through selective licensing agreements and collaborations with academic partners. The proprietary tools within our platform are designed to identify and characterize selected microbes using in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo assays. Proprietary in vitro assays simulate the interactions between microbes and human immune cells, allowing us to evaluate the immunological activity of each microbial strain in relevant experimental systems. Our in vitro assays can screen hundreds of microbes, producing more than 150 data points per strain, including levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This assists our comprehensive selection process to identify candidates for testing in relevant animal models.
Product form. The activity of our SINTAX medicines observed in preclinical studies has been driven by engagement with and modification of immune cells in the small intestine. This activity has not been reliant on engraftment (or colonization) as we have observed that our SINTAX medicines passed through the gut and did not 
distribute around the body or engraft in the gut. Furthermore, this preclinical activity was observed to be independent of the ability of our SINTAX medicines to replicate. From this observation, we believe that activity of SINTAX medicines is likely driven by recognition of structural motifs on the surface of microbes or EVs by immune cells in the small intestine. Our candidate selection process may include an additional manufacturing step for our whole-microbe candidates to develop them as non-replicating product candidates, such as EDP1867. We are also developing reduced forms of our whole-microbe product candidates, or EVs, to target SINTAX. Preclinical studies suggest that this approach may further improve potency and activity and we anticipate the initiation of clinical development of EDP2939 and EDP1908, our initial EV product candidates, in 2022.
Formulation. In our first clinical trials, product candidates were formulated as capsules containing lyophilized powder for targeted release in the small intestine. We have continued to explore potency and dose as it relates to formulation and have developed manufacturing processes that increase the concentration of EDP1815. Additionally, we have developed a tablet formulation with the higher concentration of EDP1815, also for targeted release in the small intestine. We have tested capsules with the higher concentration in a human experimental model of inflammation and we intend to test capsules and tablets with the higher concentration of EDP1815 in patients in our on-going Phase 1b clinical trial during 2021. We are committed to continuously investing in formulation development to improve the potency and delivery of our product candidates and enhance their ability to target and act on SINTAX.

Process development and manufacturing. Process development and manufacturing are critical for the translation of SINTAX medicines into therapies. Our expertise and investments in laboratory and pilot scale development have allowed us to mitigate challenges inherent to manufacturing of SINTAX medicines at clinical scale.
Process development is integrated into our research activities, combining discovery and downstream development. We believe we have achieved control of quality, identity, purity, and potency throughout the process of strain selection, fermentation, EV purification, formulation, and pharmacology, with high yield. Importantly, we believe our manufacturing processes enable us to produce a drug substance that is pharmacologically active in the form of a lyophilized powder, which is suitable for production in accordance with cGMP regulations. For each of our clinical product candidates, we have observed therapeutic activity in lyophilized powder form and in compressed tablet form in relevant preclinical mouse models and, in the case of EDP1815, in clinical studies using lyophilized powder in capsules.
We have been able to manufacture SINTAX medicines in a relatively short timeframe compared to other biologic therapies, which we believe may accelerate our speed into the clinic. Additionally, we believe that we may be able to cost-effectively manufacture SINTAX medicines.
Product Development Strategy and Portfolio
We are advancing SINTAX medicines to potentially treat a spectrum of immune-mediated diseases with an initial focus on inflammatory diseases and oncology. We expect our initial clinical trials for our product candidates to provide information on safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic responses and biomarkers of immune response in multiple indications with different pathologies and sites of disease. This may allow for expansion into a broad range of clinical indications, which could enable us to capture the breadth of clinical value.
Beyond our first wave of product candidates in inflammatory diseases and oncology, we are continuing to invest in the discovery of new candidates to build a deep pipeline across a wide range of diseases, including in neuroinflammation and metabolism, and tissue types to leverage the broad potential of our platform. We also intend to opportunistically collaborate to expand indications and accelerate development of programs where collaborators can contribute further disease-specific expertise to our platform.
In addition to product candidates based on whole, inactivated microbes, which include EDP1815 and EDP1867, we continue to advance the development of orally delivered EVs. EVs are lipoprotein nanoparticles naturally produced by some bacteria. EVs have the potential to enable increased target engagement driven by their small size as they are approximately 1/1,000th the volume of whole microbes. We have nominated two EV clinical candidates, EDP2939 and EDP1908 for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer respectively and anticipate first-in-human studies of this new product form in 2022. 
Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our current product candidates are illustrated below.
Notes:
1 The Phase 2/3 TACTIC-E study is an investigator-sponsored study being conducted by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
2 The Phase 2 trial is in collaboration with Rutgers University and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital
3 Evelo is conducting Phase 1b studies on increased concentration and tablet formulations of EDP1815 
Inflammatory Diseases Portfolio
We have three candidates in development for inflammatory diseases. EDP1815 is a whole-microbe product candidate currently in a Phase 2 trial for the treatment of psoriasis, with plans underway for an additional Phase 2 trial in atopic dermatitis, following positive Phase 1b data announced in December 2020 and January 2021. Additionally, we advanced EDP1867, an inactivated, whole-microbe product candidate, into a Phase 1b study in February 2021 in patients with atopic dermatitis. EDP2939 is our first product candidate based on EVs, and we anticipate initiation of clinical development of this product candidate in 2022. 
EDP1815
EDP1815 is an investigational oral biologic being developed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. It is a single strain of Prevotella histicola, selected for its specific pharmacology.
Human Experimental Model of Inflammation 
In addition to testing our product candidates in patients with inflammatory disease, we also have employed a human experimental model of inflammation in healthy volunteers. This model is very similar in design to a standard preclinical model of T cell driven inflammation. We have recently used this model to test two different concentrations of EDP1815 to investigate the relative effectiveness of the different concentrations. A total of 32 volunteers were enrolled into the trial and treated with either EDP1815 (n=12 per formulation) or placebo (n=4 per formulation) daily for 28 days. The participants were immunized with an antigen used in preclinical inflammation experiments. After 28 days of daily oral dosing with EDP1815 or placebo, the participants were given a skin challenge with the same antigen, which causes measurable skin inflammation a day later. Inflammation was determined by measuring five parameters in the skin at the challenge site.
The increased concentration of drug results from improvements made in the commercial-scale manufacturing process, referred to as A2. This is the same active drug at four times the concentration compared to a prior manufacturing process, referred to as A'. Twelve participants were dosed with A’ EDP1815. Another 12 participants were given the higher concentration A2 EDP185. Eight participants who received a placebo were divided between the two treatment groups. The results are in the figure below.
A2 EDP1815 is more effective than A’ at same total dose in human experimental model of inflammation
The higher concentration A2, given in fewer capsules, resulted in numerically superior reductions across the full range of skin scores compared to A’ and placebo. A2 and A’ were given at the same total daily dose of drug. These results are consistent with preclinical data that showed increased drug concentration resulted in increased activity. This is a key advance in our understanding of how to get more benefit from SINTAX medicine candidates. We plan to evaluate tablets and capsules containing the higher concentration A2 EDP1815 in patients with psoriasis in our on-going Phase 1b trial, and expect to report data in the third quarter of 2021. Results from the Phase 1b trial and our on-going Phase 2 trial in psoriasis will position us to go forward into Phase 3 trials with an optimized dose and formulation of EDP1815, which may further improve on the positive results already seen.
Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis 
Phase 2 clinical trial in psoriasis 
Based on previously reported positive clinical data in two cohorts of individuals with mild and moderate psoriasis in a Phase 1b clinical trial, we advanced EDP1815 into a Phase 2 dose ranging trial, evaluating three doses of A' EDP1815 in capsules versus placebo in approximately 225 individuals with mild and moderate psoriasis. The primary endpoint of the trial is the mean reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (“PASI”) score at 16 weeks. Other clinical measures of psoriasis are also being evaluated. We initiated the Phase 2 clinical trial in October 2020 and have completed enrollment and, therefore, now plan to report topline data for all patients in the study in the third quarter of 2021. Clinical data from this trial, if positive, may enable us to advance directly into Phase 3 registrational trials, subject to end of Phase 2 discussions with regulatory agencies.
We intend to evaluate EDP1815 in additional inflammatory disease indications, depending on the results from the Phase 2 trial. Potential indications include psoriatic arthritis, axial spondylarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Phase 1b clinical trial in atopic dermatitis
In November 2018, we initiated our ongoing Phase 1b double-blind placebo-controlled dose-escalating safety and tolerability trial of EDP1815 in healthy volunteers and individuals with mild or moderate psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. The primary endpoint of the phase 1b trial is safety and tolerability.
In December 2020 and January 2021, we reported positive clinical data from our Phase 1b trial in a cohort of patients with mild and moderate atopic dermatitis (n=24), randomized 2:1 to receive EDP1815 in capsules or placebo for 56 days. EDP1815 was well-tolerated with no treatment-related adverse events of moderate or severe intensity, and no serious adverse events. Secondary endpoints included a range of established markers of clinical efficacy in atopic dermatitis, such the Eczema Area and Severity Index (“EASI”), the Investigator’s Global Assessment times body surface area (“IGA* BSA”), and the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (“SCORAD”) scores. 
Table 1

Clinical Measure | Treatment Difference between EDP1815 and Placebo Percentage Change at Day 56*
EASI | 52% (p=0.062) 
IGA*BSA | 65% (p=0.022) 
SCORAD | 55% (p=0.043) 
*Least Squares Mean Percentage Change From Baseline. Note that the Phase 1b trial was not powered to detect statistically significant outcomes on efficacy endpoints: p-values presented are nominal values presented for illustrative purposes only.

The data showed consistent improvements in percentage change from baseline compared to placebo for all three clinical scores: EASI, IGA*BSA, and SCORAD. In addition, 7 out of 16 (44%) patients treated with EDP1815 achieved an outcome of a 50% improvement from baseline in EASI score by day 70, compared with 0% in the placebo group, showing sustained improvement in those patients responding to EDP1815.
In addition to physician-reported clinical outcomes, this trial also assessed patient-reported outcomes. Treatment with EDP1815 resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (“DLQI”) and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (“POEM”). These patient-reported outcomes capture the important impact of the disease on patients, including the domains of itch and sleep, both of which saw improvements in patients receiving EDP1815 in the trial. All five measures of itch within the Pruritus-Numerical Rating Scale (“Pruritus-NRS”), SCORAD, POEM, and DLQI showed greater improvements in the treated group at day 56 compared with placebo. We believe these results provide further evidence that modulating SINTAX has the potential to drive significant clinical benefit without the need for systemic exposure.
Subject to regulatory approval, we anticipate initiation of a Phase 2 trial of EDP1815 in atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2021.
COVID-19
EDP1815 is being evaluated in two ongoing clinical studies for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The first is a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of EDP1815 for the treatment of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 early in the course of their disease. The trial initially will evaluate 60 individuals to determine if early intervention with EDP1815 can prevent the progression of COVID-19 symptoms and the development of COVID-Related complications. Individuals who have presented at the emergency room within the last 36 hours and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 are randomized 1:1 to receive the capsule formulation of EDP1815 or placebo for 14 days, along with the standard of care. The primary endpoint is reduced requirements for oxygen therapy, as measured by the ratio of oxygen saturation (SpO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Key secondary endpoints include total symptom duration, progression along the World Health Organization (“WHO”) scale of disease severity, and mortality. The trial is being led by Reynold A. Panettieri, Jr., M.D., Vice Chancellor for Translational Medicine and Science at Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences and Professor of Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.
EDP1815 is also included as a treatment arm in the TACTIC-E clinical trial. TACTIC-E is a Phase 2/3 randomized trial, sponsored by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, that is expected to evaluate up to 469 patients per arm at Addenbrooke’s Hospital and other leading clinical centers in the United Kingdom and select international sites. The trial is investigating the safety and efficacy of certain experimental therapies in the prevention and treatment of life-threatening complications associated with COVID-19 in hospitalized individuals at early stages of the disease. The trial is enrolling individuals with COVID-19 who have identified risk factors for developing severe complications and are at risk of progression to the intensive care unit or death. The primary outcome measure of the trial is time to incidence (up to day 14) of any one of the following: death, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiovascular organ support, renal failure, hemofiltration or dialysis. Secondary outcome measures include duration of stay in hospital, duration of oxygen therapy, changes in biomarkers associated with COVID-19 progression, and time to clinical improvement.
As a result of the varying infection rates and resulting hospitalizations that have occurred with the pandemic, we experienced slower than expected enrollment early on in both trials and now expect to report data from the clinical trial conducted at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and interim safety data and futility 
analysis from TACTIC-E in the second quarter of 2021. In order to expedite patient recruitment and expand access to potential therapies for COVID-19, new trial sites have been opened for TACTIC-E, including in the United Kingdom and Mexico. 
If EDP1815 is successfully developed and approved as a treatment for COVID-19, we believe that we could rapidly scale the manufacturing of EDP1815 to supply the drug at a reasonable cost. If approved and established as effective for early intervention, we expect that oral EDP1815 could also be useful in the outpatient setting to control the community impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the Phase 2 trials are successful in COVID-19, we plan to investigate EDP1815 as a potential therapy for other diseases, such as influenza infection, in which hyperinflammation and cytokine storm can play a key role. 
EDP1867
EDP1867 is an inactivated investigational oral biologic being developed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. EDP1867 was selected from a broad screen of single strains of microbes in in vitro cellular assays and in vivo models of inflammation. In preclinical studies EDP1867 was shown to resolve multiple pathways of inflammation. This observed activity suggests a number of possible initial clinical indications to pursue for EDP1867, including TH2-dependent inflammation, which underlies atopic diseases and a large spectrum of asthma. We initiated our first Phase 1b clinical trial of EDP1867 in healthy volunteers and patients with moderate atopic dermatitis in February of 2021 and expect to report interim data in the fourth quarter of 2021.
EDP2939
EDP2939 is an EV investigational oral biologic being developed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. EDP2939 is the first EV product candidate we have nominated in our inflammation program and we anticipate initiation of clinical development in 2022.
Inflammation Preclinical Data
Each of our product candidates in our inflammation program have demonstrated the potential to simultaneously impact multiple pathways and associated cytokines in preclinical assays, suggesting that they may have broader applicability than individual cytokine-directed therapies. In addition, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-27 can inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Certain of our product candidates induced increased production of IL-10 and IL-27 in preclinical assays. Importantly, pre-clinical experiments and human biomarker data from the EDP1815 Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with psoriasis, suggest that SINTAX medicines are inflammation resolving and are not immunosuppressive. 
Inflammation Development Strategy
We selected mild-to-moderate psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema, as indications for first-in-human studies based upon our preclinical data, unmet need in large patient populations, the ease of access to patient tissue for biomarker analysis and the speed of clinical data readout. Patients with mild-to-moderate disease represent between 80% and 90% of the patient population, which is estimated to represent more than 25 million people in the United States. We believe these patients are underserved by current treatments, including topical steroids, which either inadequately control inflammation, are not safe for long-term use, or are inconvenient and burdensome in application, leading to poor adherence and reduced efficacy in a real-world setting. The majority of novel therapies, including next generation biologics targeting IL-17, IL-23 or IL4RA, two anti-inflammatory cytokines and a cytokine receptor, are only approved for patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Even in the moderate to severe setting, a large majority of eligible patients do not receive biologics. Many patients are uncomfortable with high-cost, injectable antibody therapies or with the toxicity concerns and monitoring requirements of systemic immunosuppressants. There is a large need across the spectrum of disease severity, and especially for midline, pre-biologic patients, for a safe and well-tolerated oral medicine that resolves the systemic inflammation that drives psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.
If our product candidates demonstrate safety and tolerability and limited adverse events in clinical trials, they could open up a larger market than the one currently treated by biologics. If proof-of-concept in mild-to-moderate patients is established, we also intend to broaden our studies to treat patients with moderate-to-severe inflammation, potentially expanding this market opportunity further.
In preclinical mouse models, our inflammatory disease product candidates reduced systemic inflammation with equal or better activity than current standard of care therapies. We believe that this observation may translate to broad activity across a variety of inflammatory diseases. We have produced preclinical data in distinct mouse models that are representative of different biologies, suggesting that single SINTAX medicines may impact multiple immune pathways.
T-cells of the Th1 or Th17 type are implicated in psoriasis, joint inflammatory diseases and neuroinflammation, while T-cells of the Th2 type are more important for atopies and allergic diseases. With current cytokine-directed therapies, agents are targeted towards a specific cytokine to influence one or more of these pathways. For instance, Th1-driven inflammation can be controlled by TNFa or IL-6 inhibition, Th17-driven inflammation can be controlled by IL-17 or IL-23 inhibition, and Th-2 driven inflammation can be controlled by IL-4 or IL-13 inhibition.
Oncology Portfolio
We are developing SINTAX medicines for the treatment of multiple cancer types. 
EDP1908
In December 2020, we announced EDP1908 as our lead product candidate in oncology following presentation of preclinical data at the Society for Immunotherapy for Cancer meeting in November 2020. Preclinical data presented showed that orally administered EDP1908, an EV, resulted in superior tumor growth control versus either the parent microbial strain or anti-PD-1 therapy, with an observed dose-dependent reduction in tumor growth. We anticipate initiation of clinical development in 2022.
Preclinical data suggests that EDP1908 is active through different immune mechanisms beyond those targeted by checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 inhibitors. Research suggests that checkpoint inhibition prevents the downregulation of the immune system induced by tumors. In preclinical models, we observed that EDP1908 stimulated upregulation of the immune response to tumors. Oral administration of EDP1908 in preclinical mouse models resulted in robust, dose-dependent anti-tumor activity superior to that of anti-PD-1 using different immune mechanisms. The effects were at least comparable to those reported in the literature for intratumorally administered immune stimulators.
We believe that EDP1908, and possibly additional EV product candidates, have the potential to broaden the base of cancer immunotherapy and augment current standard-of-care therapies. Treatment with EDP1908 in syngeneic mice suggested a variety of potential effects on innate and adaptive immunity, including activated IFNγ-positive cytolytic and helper lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) in the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescent biodistribution analysis showed that EDP1908 was not detected outside the gastrointestinal tract. These data suggest that EDP1908 activated innate immunity locally on host immune cells in the gut and triggered distal immune responses within the tumor microenvironment, with no apparent adverse safety or tolerability issues. We believe that oral administration of EDP1908 has the potential to offer an improved safety profile compared to systemically - or intratumorally-administered immunotherapy agents as well as broader potential for combination regimens with existing therapies.
Manufacturing
We have developed proprietary methods for the manufacture of pharmacologically active whole microbe and EVs that are scalable and transferable to cGMP manufacturing facilities. Microbes are isolated, grown and purified in a manner analogous to the manufacture of pharmaceutical drugs. The whole microbe and EV manufacturing process produces drug substance in a powder form that makes our product candidates suitable for oral administration, for instance in the form of a capsule, tablet or powder. Additionally, we believe we have established robust analytical methods to assess the identity, strength and purity of our product candidates. We expect that these controlled manufacturing processes and analytical methods will allow us to produce and release cGMP-compliant batches of material with consistent quality.
Our internal manufacturing capabilities include production of non-GMP materials for in vitro and in vivo preclinical assessment of product candidates. We currently use third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the production of materials for clinical studies. Our internal personnel have cGMP manufacturing experience to ensure efficient technology transfer and oversee the development and manufacturing activities 
conducted by our CMOs. Our agreements with CMOs include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights to our SINTAX medicine candidates.
We expect our CMOs to meet manufacturing requirements and drug supply required by our clinical studies. In some instances, we have reserved resources from CMOs for the development and manufacture of our product candidates for near-term clinical programs. We believe that these relationships are integral to ensuring reliable, high-quality drug supply for clinical development.
While we do not have a current need for commercial manufacturing capacity, we intend to evaluate both building internal capabilities and contracting with CMOs at the appropriate time. In anticipation of a possible near-term need for commercial supplies of EDP1815, we have established relationships with CMOs who have the capacity to rapidly scale the manufacturing of EDP1815.
Process development and manufacturing are critical for the development of whole microbe and EV product candidates. We believe our internal expertise and external partnerships have allowed us to address unique challenges associated with whole microbe and EV manufacturing. Some of these major challenges include limited prior know-how in the field for novel microbes, strict anaerobic growth conditions required by many commensal microbes and temperature and oxygen sensitivities that affect downstream processing.
Our proprietary methods for the manufacture of pharmacologically active SINTAX medicines address these three challenges. Many human commensals are strict anaerobes with no development precedent. Process development of commensal microbes requires strong technical expertise in microbiology and anaerobic fermentation. We are pioneering strict anaerobic bioprocessing technologies that can allow for rapid development of robust manufacturing processes. We continue to optimize processes across a wide range of parameters in fermentation and formulation. 
Our manufacturing processes consist of drug substance and drug product manufacturing. We have established expertise across all aspects of drug substance manufacturing operations including cell banking, fermentation, cell separation and lyophilization. We have also advanced knowledge related to drug product manufacturing and our drug product has demonstrated stability under long-term storage conditions. We will continue to advance novel formulation technologies for enhanced delivery and activity in future trials.
Sales and Marketing
Given the current developmental stage of our product candidates and platform, we have not yet established a commercial organization. We intend to commercialize our products globally and in multiple disease areas. We intend to do this both through selectively building our own sales and marketing team and partnering or collaborating with third parties.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover both our broad platform and individual product candidates. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treatment, methods of manufacture, and methods for patient selection created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates, as well as discoveries based on our proprietary platforms. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce any patents that we may obtain, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position and, in the future, may rely on or leverage in-licensing opportunities.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent may be challenged in courts 
after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or at all, whether the claims of any patent applications, should they issue, will cover our product candidates, or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors or otherwise provide any competitive advantage, or, if challenged, in courts or administrative proceedings, be determined to be invalid or unenforceable.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Accordingly, we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter, and we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "USPTO") to determine priority of invention.
Patent Portfolio 
Our patent portfolio includes patent applications in varying stages of prosecution in the United States and selected jurisdictions outside of the United States. As of March 5, 2021, our patent portfolio consisted of twelve issued U.S. patents, one European patent, one Singaporean patent, and 51 patent families, which include composition, method of use, formulation, and manufacturing process claims. Additionally, a Notice of Allowance has been received for one application in the United States. Of the U.S. patents in our portfolio, seven are owned by us, and five are exclusively licensed from the Mayo Clinic Foundation for Medical Education and Research, an affiliate of Mayo Clinic, (the "Mayo Clinic"). The European patent is owned by us, and the Singaporean patent is exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago. Of the patent families in our portfolio, 49 are owned by us, one is exclusively licensed to us from the University of Chicago and one is exclusively licensed to us from the Mayo Clinic. 
The patent portfolio includes patents and applications covering the following:
•Formulation platforms in which applications that issue as a patent are expected to expire in 2038 to 2041.
•Manufacturing platforms in which applications that issue as a patent are expected to expire in 2041.
•Modality platforms in which applications that issue as a patent are expected to expire in 2038 to 2041.
•Inflammation portfolio:
▪EDP1815, consisting of five issued U.S. patents in-licensed from the Mayo Clinic, covering compositions and methods of use (the patents from the Mayo Clinic are expected to expire in 2030) and ten patent families we own directed to compositions, methods of use, formulations and manufacturing processes. Any applications claiming priority to these applications we own that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2040 to 2041; 
▪EDP1867, consisting of six patent families we own directed to compositions, methods of use and formulations. Any applications claiming priority to these applications that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2039 and 2041; and
▪EDP2939, consisting of two patent families we own directed to compositions and methods of use. Any applications claiming priority to these applications that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2038 and 2042.
•Oncology portfolio:
▪EDP1908, consisting of one patent family we own directed to compositions and methods of use. Any applications claiming priority to these applications that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2041.
▪An oral oncology platform exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago, consisting of 24 pending applications and one issued patent in Singapore. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2036.
Patent Term
The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of such an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or fourteen years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug, and a patent cannot be extended more than once or for more than a single product. During the period of extension, if granted, the scope of exclusivity is limited to the approved product for approved uses. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply, if appropriate, for patent term extension on patents covering those product candidates, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture.
Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities’ relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
License and Manufacturing Agreements 
We are a party to several license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. The licensed intellectual property includes composition of matter and methods of using monoclonal microbials. In some cases, licenses cover physical material in the form of microbial strains. Certain diligence and financial obligations are tied to these agreements. Additionally, we are a party to manufacturing agreements for committed resources and exclusivity. We consider the following agreements to be material to our business.
University of Chicago License Agreement
In March 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Chicago. This agreement gives us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to patent rights related to administration of microbes to treat cancer. Under this agreement, we may make, have made, use, import, have sold, offer to sell, and sell microbial products to treat cancer in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Many microbial genera are covered by these patent rights. In addition, we have a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use technical information disclosed to us by the University of Chicago for the development and commercialization of microbial products to treat cancer in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Under this agreement, we must use commercially reasonable 
efforts to develop and market licensed products. Commercially reasonable efforts can be demonstrated by achieving specific milestones by specific dates.
Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we paid the University of Chicago an upfront fee of an amount less than $0.5 million and are required to make low five-digit license maintenance fees on an annual basis, creditable against royalties owed in that given year. In addition, we may owe the University of Chicago future milestone payments totaling an aggregate of approximately $60.9 million upon achievement of specific milestones, the vast majority of which are associated with specific regulatory and commercial milestones.
The University of Chicago is entitled to receive low single-digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of products that fall under the licensed patent rights on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. The royalty percentage depends on the amount of annual net sales and whether the product is covered by valid patent claims, un-published technical information, or published technical information. Our valid claims royalty obligations to the University of Chicago will expire upon the later of (a) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim covering the product, or (b) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity of a product covered by the patent rights. Technical information royalty obligations will expire upon the earlier of (a) fifteen years from first commercial sale of the applicable product, or (b) when a substantially similar product comes onto the market.
Under the license agreement, we have the right to sublicense licensed rights to third parties, provided that the sublicense agreement is consistent with the terms of the original license and that we hold any sublicensees compliant. Should we enter a sublicense under these patent rights, we are required to pay the University of Chicago a percentage of our sublicense revenue. The University of Chicago is entitled to percentages of sublicense revenue in the low- to mid-teens depending on the stage of development of licensed products at the time the sublicense is entered.
The University of Chicago maintains control of patent prosecution, defense and maintenance on their patent rights. We are responsible for reimbursing the University of Chicago for patent costs incurred. If we cease payment for patent prosecution, our patent rights will terminate and revert to the University of Chicago. We have the first right, but not obligation, to control any post grant proceedings and to take action in the prosecution or prevention of any infringement by a third party to patent rights.
The license granted by the University of Chicago is subject to any retained rights of the U.S. government in the patent rights and to retained rights of the University of Chicago to use the patent rights for non-commercial research purposes. The license agreement will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of (a) expiration date of the last to expire licensed patents, or (b) a set number of years in the mid-teens from first commercial sale of a licensed product. Prior to the expiration date, we may terminate the license with written notification to the University of Chicago. Prior to the expiration date, the University of Chicago may terminate the agreement in whole or in part if we fail to make payments within thirty days of receiving a written notice of missed payment, if we breach any material obligation of the agreement and do not cure such breach within thirty days, if we become bankrupt or insolvent, or if we are dissolved or liquidated. The University of Chicago may also terminate the license if we fail to show commercially reasonable efforts in meeting diligence milestones.
License Agreement with the Mayo Clinic
In August 2017, we entered into an agreement with the Mayo Clinic to license intellectual property and microbial strains. This agreement gives us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to patent rights related to compositions of matter and methods of using microbes from a specific species to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In addition to patent rights, this agreement also includes an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to an immuno-modulatory microbial strain isolated from a human small intestinal sample by the Mayo Clinic. Under the licensed patent rights and/or using the licensed microbial strain, we may make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, and import products containing microbes of a specific species to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In addition, we have a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use know-how disclosed to us by the Mayo Clinic related to the development and commercialization of products containing microbes of a specific species to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The licensed patents include five issued U.S. patents. Issued claims cover compositions containing microbes from a specified species and methods of using these compositions to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. EDP1815, one of our lead candidates in the inflammation program, contains the microbial strain licensed from the Mayo Clinic and is covered by these patent rights. Under this agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to bring licensed products to the market.
In consideration for the licenses, we paid the Mayo Clinic an upfront payment of $0.2 million. Beginning on the second anniversary of the effective date, we owe the Mayo Clinic escalating annual license maintenance fees in the low- to mid-five digits. Annual license maintenance fees count towards milestones and royalties owed in a given year. The Mayo Clinic is entitled to future clinical, approval and sales milestones. In addition, we have agreed to pay the Mayo Clinic future milestone payments totaling a maximum of $1.0 million upon achievement of specific development milestones and $56 million upon achievement of specific regulatory and commercial milestones.
The Mayo Clinic is entitled to receive low single-digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of products that fall under the licensed patent rights or contain the licensed microbial strain on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. The royalty percentage depends on the amount of annual net sales and whether the product is covered by valid patent claims or contains the licensed microbial strain. Royalties on products containing the licensed microbial strain will only be due in countries where licensed products are not covered by valid claims. Our valid claims royalty obligations to the Mayo Clinic will terminate on expiration of the last to expire valid claim covering the product. Royalty obligations on products containing the licensed microbial strain will expire 15 years from the first commercial sale of the licensed product.
Under the license agreement, we have the right to sublicense licensed patent rights and the licensed microbial strain to third parties through multiple tiers, provided that the sublicense agreement is on substantially the same terms as the original license and that we are responsible for the performance of sublicensees. We must obtain the Mayo Clinic’s permission to grant any fully paid-up, royalty-free or exclusive sublicenses. We have no financial obligations to the Mayo Clinic related to sublicenses.
The Mayo Clinic has the responsibility to prepare, file, prosecute or abandon its patent rights. We may provide prior comment and advice to the Mayo Clinic and we are responsible for reimbursing the Mayo Clinic for past and future patent costs. If we cease payment for patent preparation, filing or prosecution, our patent rights will terminate and revert to the Mayo Clinic. We have the first right, but not obligation, to control any post grant proceedings and to take action in the prosecution or prevention of any infringement by a third party to patent rights.
The license granted by Mayo Clinic is subject to any retained rights of the US government in the patent rights and to retained rights of Mayo Clinic to use the patent rights and licensed microbial strain for non-commercial research purposes, which excludes human use. The license to patent rights will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the expiration date of the last to expire licensed patents. The license to Mayo Clinic’s microbial strain will expire 15 years from first commercial sale of a product containing the licensed microbial strain. Prior to the expiration date, Mayo Clinic may terminate the license if we fail to make payments within thirty days of receiving a written notice of missed payment, if we breach any material obligation of the agreement and do not cure such breach within thirty days, if we become bankrupt or insolvent, or if we or any sublicensee directly or indirectly brings suit against Mayo Clinic. Upon early termination of our license, any sublicensee that is not in material breach of the agreement will have the right to retain its sublicense to the patent rights and microbial strain. We do not have the right to terminate the agreement prior to the expiration date.
Biose Committed Resource and Exclusivity Agreement
Effective February 2018, we entered into an exclusivity and commitment agreement with Biose Industrie ("Biose"). Under this agreement, Biose reserved manufacturing resources for the manufacture of our drug substance according to a specified schedule of manufacturing runs over a three-year period. We were required to pay Biose fees in the high five digits to low six digits for each run depending on the type of run being conducted. If we did not use committed manufacturing resources, we were required to pay Biose for these resources unless Biose was able to re-sell unused runs.
In addition to manufacturing resources, this agreement included exclusivity provisions, which ensured that we were Biose’s exclusive customer for the manufacture of certain microbial biotherapeutic products. We were required to pay annual fees in the mid six digits to Biose in consideration for these exclusivity provisions.
The term of the agreement was three years from the effective date. We had the right to terminate the agreement at any time with prior notice within a specified period to Biose, or if there was a change of control of Biose that adversely affected our interest. In the event that we terminated at will, we were obligated to pay Biose a mid-range percentage of the committed manufacturing resource fees for a specified period less than one year following the effective date of termination. In addition, both parties had the right to terminate if the other party 
materially breached the agreement and did not cure such breach within a specified period or if either party became bankrupt or insolvent, or was dissolved or liquidated. The agreement expired on February 15, 2021 in accordance with its terms.
Sacco Collaboration Agreement
In July 2019, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Sacco S.r.l. ("Sacco"), an affiliate of one of our contract manufacturing organizations. Pursuant to the agreement, Sacco has agreed that it and its affiliates will, on an exclusive and worldwide basis for and on behalf of us, manufacture and supply single strain, non-genetically modified microbes intended for oral delivery or oral use in pharmaceutical products for a period of five years. Sacco and its affiliates may not manufacture and supply single strain, non-genetically modified microbes for oral delivery or oral use in pharmaceutical products for itself or other parties, with the exception of pre-existing products for pre-existing customers. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to pay annual fees in the mid six digits to Sacco during the exclusivity period. 
The agreement will remain in effect during the exclusivity period and may be terminated by (i) us upon written notice to Sacco if an independent third-party representative concludes following an audit that Sacco or its affiliates are not in compliance with the exclusivity provisions of the agreement, (ii) Sacco upon written notice to us if the manufacturing relationship has been inactive for a period of six consecutive months and there are no services scheduled to be performed or products scheduled to be supplied within the next six months, or (iii) either party in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for 20 business days or the insolvency of the other party.
Cambrex Master Services Agreement 
In December 2020, we entered into a development and clinical master services agreement with Halo Pharmaceutical, Inc. d/b/a Cambrex Whippany (“Cambrex”). Pursuant to the agreement, Cambrex has agreed that it will perform manufacturing process development, manufacturing, packaging, related analytical and storage services for us, as mutually agreed by the parties from time to time in work orders. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to pay service fees to Cambrex and to reimburse Cambrex for purchasing excipients, components, consumables, raw materials, packaging and other items necessary for Cambrex to perform the services, as mutually agreed in a work order. We will supply active pharmaceutical ingredients to Cambrex to enable it to perform the services.
At our request or upon expiration or termination of the agreement, Cambrex has agreed to provide technical assistance to us, at our cost, to implement the technology transfer of the manufacturing processes developed by Cambrex under the agreement to us and of related analytical testing methodologies to us or a third party designated by us.
Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will expire on the later of (i) five years from the effective date or (ii) six months after the expiration or termination of all work orders. We may terminate the agreement or any work order at any time upon 60 days or 5 business days, respectively, prior written notice to Cambrex. In addition, either party may terminate for an uncured material default or if the other party becomes bankrupt or insolvent.
The agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by Evelo, indemnification obligations of Evelo and Cambrex, and other obligations of the parties.
Collaboration
Merck-MSD International GmbH
In November 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Merck under which we are sponsoring and conducting a clinical trial evaluating EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and checkpoint inhibitor relapsed tumors. Under the agreement, we retain sole ownership of all rights to EDP1503, and there are no material financial terms or commitments required of either party. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid growth and a dynamic landscape of proprietary therapeutic candidates. While we believe that our monoclonal microbial platform and candidates, coupled with our resources and industry expertise, give us a competitive advantage in the field, we face competition from a variety of institutions, including larger pharmaceutical companies with more resources. Specialty biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, as well as public and private institutions are also potential sources of competitive products and technologies.
In both inflammatory diseases and oncology, we anticipate intensifying competition as new therapies are approved and advanced technologies become available. Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have considerably greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Competitors may also have more experience developing, obtaining approval for, and marketing novel treatments in the indications we are pursuing. These factors could give our competitors an advantage over us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, completing clinical development, and commercializing their products. Competitors that are able to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can for our products may also establish a stronger market position, diminishing our commercial opportunity. Key considerations that would impact our capacity to effectively compete include the efficacy, safety, ease of use, as well as pricing and reimbursement of our products.
In autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, we may be challenged by a wide range of competitors. In later, more severe stages of disease, the majority of competition will stem from companies marketing or developing injectable biologics and novel small molecule therapies, such as AbbVie Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc, Novartis International A.G., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Sanofi S.A., Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Amgen Inc. Potentially competing mechanisms of action include TNF, IL-4, IL-17, IL-23, JAK, TYK2, and PDE4 inhibitors. Novel delivery of biologics, particularly via oral administration, and the entry of biosimilars will also add to competition within the therapeutic area. In more mild disease segments, we may face competition from companies marketing or developing topical formulations of small molecules for inflammatory skin diseases, including Pfizer Inc., Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc., and Dermavant Sciences Ltd. 
Significant competition exists in the immuno-oncology field, where we are developing product candidates. Although our SINTAX medicine approach is unique from most other existing or investigational therapies in immuno-oncology, we will need to compete with all currently or imminently available therapies within the indications where our development is focused. Although there is a wide range of potentially competitive mechanisms, possible synergies between these and SINTAX medicines will also be evaluated.
The main classes of immunotherapy that are available or are being evaluated by our competitors include:
•Checkpoint inhibitors: Agenus Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol Myers Squibb, F. Hoffmann-La Roche A.G., Merck, Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.; and
•Cell therapy: Bristol Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Inc., and Novartis International A.G.
Government Regulation
Government Regulation in the United States
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval for our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health 
Service Act. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a biologics license application ("BLA") and licensure, which constitutes approval, by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. 
The process required by the FDA before our biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice ("GLP") requirements;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application ("IND") which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin;
•approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at each clinical site before the clinical trial is commenced;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for each proposed indication, conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice ("GCP") requirements;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
Preclinical and Clinical Trials
Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which must be conducted in accordance with GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. 
A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other clinical trials or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent IRB for each investigator site proposing to participate in a clinical trial must also review and approve the clinical trial and its informed consent form before it can begin at that site, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some clinical trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 - the investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2 - the investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3 - the investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.
In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. Concurrent with clinical trials, biotechnology companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Although most clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA, under the IND regulations and procedures described above, there are certain circumstances under which clinical trials can be conducted without submission of an IND. For example, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND.
BLA Submission and FDA Review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in 
the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee unless a waiver is granted, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. Each BLA submitted to the FDA is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days of the FDA’s receipt of the application. If the BLA is found to be complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full substantive review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of reviewing BLAs within ten months of the 60-day filing date for standard review or six months for BLAs designated for priority review, but the overall timeframe is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the biological product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility or facilities in which it is manufactured meet standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured, and will not license the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance with GCP requirements, and will not license the biologic unless compliance with such requirements is satisfactory. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. 
For example, a product candidate is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor meetings with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A BLA is eligible for Priority Review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. 
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing clinical trials or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
Post-Approval Requirements
Licensed biologics that are manufactured or distributed in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record keeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
Any biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals remain subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon BLA sponsors and their contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Biosimilars and Regulatory Exclusivity
As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the "ACA", the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the "BPCIA") established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway provides legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics based on their similarity to an existing brand product, referred to as a reference product, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable with a brand product. 
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
Under the BPCIA the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for a reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological drug products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. In addition, the period of exclusivity provided by the BPCIA only operates against third parties seeking approval via the abbreviated pathway, but would not prevent third parties from pursuing approval via the traditional approval pathway. 
In addition, a biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of drugs and biologics. For instance, in the European Economic Area (the "EEA") (comprised of the 27 European Union Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either a centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure-Under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"), the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application (the "MAA") by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops.
National authorization procedures-There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the European Union until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the European Union. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
The criteria for designating an "orphan medicinal product" in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EEA a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. The ten year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing 
authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice and the related national implementing provisions of the individual European Union Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union (the “EU”). Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier, or the Common Technical Document, with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual Member State and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
In April 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, (the “Clinical Trials Regulation”) was adopted. The Clinical Trial Regulation is expected to enter into force by the end of 2021 but this could be delayed. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all the European Union Member States and will supersede the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the "European Union portal"; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, the U.S. federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations related to payments and other transfer of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers, as well as similar state and foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors and governments provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products.
In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, 
examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Furthermore, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. By way of example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, absent additional congressional action. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
Research and Development
We have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to our efforts to develop our product candidates.  We incurred research and development expenses of $69.6 million and $63.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development in 2021 as we continue to advance our product candidates through clinical development.
Employees
As of March 5, 2021, we had 90 full-time employees, including 40 with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of those full-time employees, 67 are engaged in research and development. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
