Item 1. Business
A.The Company
SIFCO Industries, Inc. ("SIFCO," "Company," "we" or "our"), an Ohio corporation, was incorporated in 1916. The executive offices of the Company are located at 970 East 64th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44103, and its telephone number is (216) 881-8600.
SIFCO is engaged in the production of forgings, sub-assemblies, and machined components primarily for the Aerospace and Energy ("A&E") markets. The processes and services include forging, heat-treating and machining. The Company's operations are conducted in a single business segment. Information relating to the Company's financial results is set forth in the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
COVID-19 Pandemic
Since being recognized by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") outbreak continues to impact the United States and other countries in which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continue to evolve, including scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, the potential for additional outbreaks of the virus, the impact of new variants of COVID-19, actions to contain the pandemic's spread or treat its impact, the ongoing effectiveness of the vaccine and vaccination rates, and governmental, business and other actions taken in response to the pandemic. The exact timing and pace of the recovery is currently indeterminable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since experienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, and, throughout the course of the pandemic, new variants of COVID-19 have been identified and spread significantly, resulting in additional restrictions put in place by certain governments around the world. Capital markets and economies worldwide have been negatively impacted by COVID-19 and given the fluidity of the situation, it is still unclear how lasting and deep the economic impacts will be, specifically in relation to the commercial aerospace and energy industries. 
B.Principal Products and Services
Operations
SIFCO is a manufacturer of forgings and machined components for the A&E markets. We provide our customers with envelope and precision forgings, rough and finished machined components, as well as sub-assemblies. SIFCO services both original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") and aftermarket customers with products that range in size from approximately 2 to 1,200 pounds. The Company's strategic vision is to build a leading A&E company positioned for long-term, stable growth and profitability. 
SIFCO's long-term plan is to have a balance comprised of military and commercial aerospace revenues, supplemented with energy, commercial space, and adjacent market components. In fiscal 2021, commercial and military revenues accounted for 36.7% and 63.3% of revenues, respectively, compared with 42.6% in commercial revenues and 57.4% in military revenues in fiscal 2020. The Company's capabilities are focused on supplying critical components, consisting primarily of steel, high temperature alloys, nickel alloys, titanium and aluminum.
SIFCO operates from multiple locations. SIFCO manufacturing facilities are located in Cleveland, Ohio ("Cleveland"); Orange, California ("Orange"); and Maniago, Italy ("Maniago"). SIFCO's operations are AS 9100D and/or ISO 9001:2015 certified and the Company also holds multiple NADCAP certifications and site approvals from key OEM customers.
The Company's success is not dependent on patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises.
Raw Materials
SIFCO generally has multiple sources for its raw materials, which consist primarily of high-quality metals essential to its business. Suppliers of such materials are located principally in North America and Europe. SIFCO generally does not depend on a single source for the supply of its materials. Due to the limited supply of certain raw materials, some material is provided by a small number of suppliers; however, SIFCO believes that its sources are adequate for its business. 
Products
SIFCO’s products are made primarily of steel, stainless steel, nickel alloy, titanium and aluminum. SIFCO's product offerings include: OEM and aftermarket components for aircraft and industrial gas turbine engines; steam turbine blades; structural airframe components; aircraft landing gear components; aircraft wheels and brakes; critical rotating components for helicopters; and commercial/industrial products. SIFCO also provides heat-treatment, surface-treatment, non-destructive testing and select machining and sub-assembly of forged components.
Industry
The performance of the domestic and international air transport industry, the energy industry, as well as government defense spending, directly and significantly impact the performance of SIFCO. The impact of COVID-19 continues to be assessed by the Company. It has significantly impacted the commercial aerospace industry through the ongoing disruption of global travel, which remains depressed due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, as the outbreak of variants and responses continue to be fluid and ever changing, the shape and speed of recovery for the commercial aerospace industry remain uncertain; however, resurgences in COVID-19 infections and/or new strains of the virus, along with the availability, distribution and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be critical factors in the recovery of passenger travel.
•SIFCO supplies new and spare components to the U.S. military for aircraft, helicopters, vehicles, and munitions. The defense budget in the United States varies from year to year, driven by defense procurement policy and government budget constraints. To this point, the defense aerospace market has not been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Uncertainty may arise if the government reprioritizes funding as a result of, among other factors, potential changes in the threat environment, defense spending levels, government priorities, political leadership, procurement strategy, military strategy and planning, and broader changes in social, economic or political demands or priorities. Certain programs in which the Company participates have been favorable and are expected to continue.
•SIFCO supplies new and spare components for commercial aircraft, principally for large aircraft produced by Boeing and Airbus. As the pandemic has continued, the decrease in passenger air travel demand has impacted and continues to impact our customers' orders for new aircraft. Current estimates regarding the return of passenger air traffic to pre-COVID-19 levels is another two to four years as recovery has been extremely uneven. Increases in domestic leisure travel has led to some recovery and domestic business travel is expected to pick-up later into 2022, while international travel continues to lag as individual countries and regions have experienced varied recovery from, and resurgences in, the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, build rates, particularly the Boeing 777X, 787, 737 Max and the Airbus A320/A321neo and A350, declined and partially rebounded in 2021, but not as quickly as previously anticipated.
•SIFCO supplies new and spare components to the energy industry, particularly the industrial gas and steam turbine markets. The industrial gas and steam turbine markets have experienced a downturn in demand for new units in the near term. While alternative energy markets continue to strengthen, oil and gas prices are expected to rebound given rising gas prices from historic lows. As such, it's currently anticipated that purchases of parts and supplies within the industry will increase. SIFCO has positioned itself to be less dependent on OEM production, but with flexibility to address the demand cycle in this segment as well as continuing to support the aftermarket.
•SIFCO also supplies components to the commercial space industry, which is rapidly evolving. An increasing number of commercial companies are participating in the space launch and reentry industry, which brings continuous development, innovation in technologies, and new approaches in this market. We believe there is an opportunity for SIFCO to gain an increased market share as this industry continues to evolve and grow.
Competition
SIFCO competes with numerous companies, approximately fifteen of which are known by SIFCO.  SIFCO competes with both U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers of forgings, some of which are significantly larger than SIFCO; however, our competitors range from companies focused on the A&E markets to large diversified corporations that may also have business interests outside of the A&E markets to smaller companies that offer a limited portfolio of products in this market. SIFCO believes that it has an advantage and distinguishes itself in the primary markets it serves due to its: (i) demonstrated A&E expertise; (ii) focus on quality and customer service; (iii) operating initiatives such as SMART (Streamlined Manufacturing Activities to Reduce Time/Cost) and Six Sigma; and (iv) broad range of capabilities and offerings. As customers establish and utilize new facilities throughout the world, SIFCO will continue to encounter non-U.S. competition. SIFCO believes it can expand its market share by (i) continuing to increase capacity utilization; (ii) broadening its product lines through investment in equipment that expands its manufacturing capabilities; and (iii) developing new customers in markets where the participants require similar technical competence and service as those in the A&E industries. See further discussion of the risks relating to competition SIFCO faces in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Government Contracts
Companies, such as SIFCO, that supply equipment and products to the U.S. military are subject to certain risks related to commercial relationships with the U.S. government and its agencies. Under the terms of these agreements, it is possible for demand and build rate to fluctuate or for the U.S. government to terminate existing contracts.
Customers
During fiscal 2021, SIFCO had two customers that accounted for 20% of consolidated net sales; and 38% of the Company's consolidated net sales were from three customers and their direct subcontractors, which individually accounted for 17%, 11%, and 10% of net sales, respectively. SIFCO believes that the loss of sales to such customers would result in a material adverse impact on the business. However, SIFCO has maintained a business relationship with these customers for many years and is currently conducting business with them under multi-year agreements. Although there is no assurance that these relationships will continue, as one or more major customers have reduced their purchases, SIFCO has generally been successful in gaining new business, thereby avoiding a material adverse impact on the Company. SIFCO relies on its ability to adapt its services and operations to changing requirements of the market in general and its customers in particular. No material part of SIFCO’s business is seasonal. For additional financial information about geographic areas, refer to Note 12, Business Information, of the consolidated financial statements.
Backlog of Orders
SIFCO’s total backlog as of September 30, 2021 decreased to $77.2 million, compared with $91.1 million as of September 30, 2020. Orders for delivery scheduled in the upcoming fiscal year 2022 decreased to $59.3 million compared with $63.6 million scheduled in fiscal 2021. Orders may be subject to modification or cancellation by the customer with limited charges. The decrease in total backlog as of September 30, 2021 compared with the previous year is primarily due to timing of annual awards and SIFCO's customers adjusting orders due to operational and pandemic related challenges within the commercial airline industry. The continuing uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its duration and impact on the commercial airline industry is expected and may continue to impact sales order backlog growth in that market into fiscal 2022. Backlog information may not be indicative of future sales.
C.Regulatory Matters
The Company is subject to a number of domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide and is required to comply with various environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations. The Company believes that it is in compliance with these laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with such laws and regulations have not had, and are not presently expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company or its subsidiaries under existing regulations and interpretations. Nevertheless, the Company cannot guarantee that, in the future, it will not incur additional costs for compliance or that such costs will not be material.
D.Human Capital Management
SIFCO employed approximately 446 full-time employees at the beginning of fiscal 2021, which decreased to approximately 378 employees at the end of fiscal 2021. In response to the impact of COVID-19 on the commercial aerospace industry (including declines in revenues of our customers and temporary closures in accordance with government health orders), during fiscal 2021, the Company experienced two furloughs at its Orange facility, which primarily manufactures commercial aerospace product. While the Company has brought back the workforce subject to the furloughs, the Company has experienced a decrease in the number of employees. 
The Company’s employees include full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. Approximately 71% of our employees were located within the U.S. and 29% of our employees were located in Italy. Approximately 66% of our workforce within the U.S. is composed of skilled and unskilled labor, and the remaining population includes management, corporate, administrative and support staff.
The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements ("CBA") with certain employees within the Cleveland location. The Cleveland location has two bargaining units; the Company ratified its CBA with one such unit in December 2019. The second bargaining unit, under its new representative the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, is in ongoing negotiations with the Company. There continues to be no work disruptions as the Company operates per the terms of the previous contract. The Company’s obligations will be more fully understood following the ratification of a collective bargaining agreement. The Maniago location is party to the National Collective Agreement in Metalworking, which renewed in February 2021. 
The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. There are several ways in which we attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent and measure the ongoing effectiveness of our human capital management practices, including by making the safety and health of our employees a top priority. The Company 
is focused on ensuring the health of our employees through the implementation of standards, controls, and inspections to help ensure that our operations and premises comply with national and local regulations. In addition, the Company conducts annual employee development reviews, identifies growth opportunities, which include employee rotations, and engages employees in continuous improvement activities. 
During fiscal 2021, we experienced a higher level of turnover, along with a shortage of applicants to fill staffing requirements at our U.S. locations due to the current labor shortage affecting most businesses across the United States. This has adversely affected our operating efficiency. The steps we have taken to attract and retain labor include attending hiring events, broadening our recruitment platforms, paying retention bonuses, offering enhanced wages and paying sign-on bonuses.
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we developed, implemented, and have maintained procedures and protocols to minimize the risk to the health and safety of our employees continuing to operate our facilities and provide our products to our customers on a timely basis. Included among these procedures were providing for remote work where practical and implementing protocols for social distancing, disinfecting, mask-wearing, symptom monitoring and personal hygiene. We continue to maintain appropriate health and safety measures for our employees as the pandemic continues. Throughout the pandemic, we have consistently been able to meet our customers' demands for our products, while at the same time making the necessary investments to ensure that we prioritize the health, safety and welfare of our employees.
