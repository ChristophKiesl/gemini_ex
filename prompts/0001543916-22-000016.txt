Item 1. Business
Overview
ForgeRock, Inc. (the “Company” or “ForgeRock”) supports billions of identities to help people simply and safely access the connected world — from shopping and banking to accessing company networks to get their work done. We make this possible through a unified and extensive identity platform to enable enterprises to provide exceptional digital user experiences without compromising security and privacy. This allows enterprises to deepen their relationships with customers and increase the productivity of their workforce and partners, while at the same time providing better security and regulatory compliance.
We estimate the global market opportunity for consumer, workforce, the Internet of Things (“IoT”) and services identity to be $71 billion. Identity is foundational to the growth of enterprises in the era of digital transformation because it enables enterprises to create frictionless user experiences that are both simple and secure. Digital identity has become a top priority for enterprises, and is viewed as a way to grow business and gain competitive advantage by enabling personalized, seamless, and secure omnichannel experiences. We are uniquely positioned to expand our share of this growing market by addressing emerging customer needs and by continuing to displace legacy, homegrown, and point identity solutions that cannot meet the functionality, performance, and scale that enterprises require.
Our proprietary multi-tenant SaaS architecture with complete tenant isolation enables enterprise-grade data protection and performance. We maximize performance by not throttling or rate limiting individual customer environments, which can be critical for enterprises especially during large usage spikes such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Our platform is purpose-built for enterprises to create natural and frictionless identity experiences while providing capabilities to secure the enterprise in a Zero Trust environment. We are unique in the identity market due to the combination of: (1) our full suite platform that works for all kinds of identities, integrates with complex environments, and operates at high scale and performance; (2) the availability of our platform through multiple deployment options; and (3) our recognition as a market leader by premier industry analysts.
Our land-and-expand business model is centered on our ability to help our customers succeed and deliver on their value expectations. Our strong dollar-based net retention rate is further driven by our continuous investments in technology innovation and significant modular additions to our product portfolio. Once customers experience the benefits of our platform, they often expand their investments with ForgeRock in four different ways – through more identities, more use cases, more product modules, and more deployments. We have successfully sold our platform to a variety of C-suite level decision makers who are driving business transformation initiatives with increasing budgets year-over-year.
The ForgeRock Identity Platform
We provide a leading modern identity platform that enables enterprises to secure, manage, and govern the identities of everything—consumers, employees and partners, APIs, microservices, devices, and IoT. More than organizations around the world leverage our platform to create seamless and secure digital experiences for collectively over three billion identities.
The ForgeRock Identity Platform includes a full suite of identity management, access management, identity governance, and AI-powered autonomous identity capabilities to serve the CIAM, AM, and IGA needs of enterprises. Our platform is deployable in a variety of configurations that can be combined, including self- managed environments such as public and private cloud environments, and through ForgeRock Identity Cloud.
We provide the ability to manage multiple identity types:
•Consumer. Our platform enables enterprises to provide secure digital identity experiences for their consumers. User journeys built on our platform provide recognition and personalization across channels and devices, which we believe leads to better customer acquisition, loyalty, and retention while reducing friction and fraud.
•Workforce. Our platform helps enterprises increase the productivity of their employees, partners, and contingent workers by automatically enabling access to appropriate systems during the worker lifecycle. Our platform also helps reduce enterprise risk by securing system access and governing that the provisioned access is appropriate.
•IoT and Services. Our platform helps enterprises secure non-human identities, including IoT, machine identities, bots, APIs, and microservices.
We have an integrated set of comprehensive services to orchestrate and secure the user identity journeys across four fundamental areas:
•Identity Management. Automates the identity lifecycle process, including initial set-up, provisioning, transfers, changes, privacy considerations, security protections, and departures.
•Access Management. Provides simple and secure access management, using rich context and adaptive intelligence to make continuous access decisions.
•Identity Governance. Manages and reduces risk from users having excessive or unnecessary access to applications, systems, devices, and data.
•Autonomous Identity. Provides an enterprise-wide view of access, streamlines and automates governance processes, and reduces risk related to digital identities.
Why Leading Enterprises Choose ForgeRock
•We enable enterprises to deliver exceptional user experiences without compromising security. We provide capabilities, such as passwordless and usernameless authentication that free users from the challenges and security risks associated with weak and forgotten credentials. Further, our Intelligent Access Trees enable our customers to quickly create flexible and tailored user identity journeys allowing for frictionless, seamless, and consistent omnichannel user experiences that also result in enhanced security.
▪We offer a full suite of capabilities that enable enterprises to secure, manage, and govern identities in a unified modern platform. Our platform includes a full suite of identity functionality across CIAM, AM, and IGA, and a differentiated identity object modeling approach that supports all identity types. Our unified platform is built to work with enterprises’ complex landscape of applications and infrastructure and fulfill their identity needs across four fundamental areas: identity management, access management, identity governance, and autonomous identity.
▪Our platform manages all identity types. Under our Identity of Everything philosophy, we built our platform for consumers, the workforce, and IoT and services. Further, our platform enables our customers to understand and set policies based on the relationships between different identities. For example, a parent and child relationship where the parent must authorize transactions on behalf of the child, or a connected car with different drivers in a household with various restrictions. While each identity has different requirements, our platform can unify the enterprise architecture and security design across multiple identity types.
▪For consumers, our platform enables enterprises to create personalized, simple, and secure identity journeys across multiple services and devices, regardless of where a consumer begins or continues their experience.
▪For the workforce, our platform enables enterprises to increase the productivity of their workforce and partners by allowing users to login from anywhere, on any device, and quickly access necessary information with enterprise-grade security. Our platform provides foundational context designed to continuously ensure users are who they say they are as well as constantly fine tune user access based on signals and other gathered information.
▪For IoT and services, since there are no biometrics or passwords that devices can use, our platform is designed to close the IoT security gap by allowing enterprises to create trusted identities to secure authenticity and authorization of IoT devices and their transactions or data streams. Our platform is differentiated in its ability to define identity objects and their attributes, and relationships between them.
▪Our platform delivers enterprise-grade performance and scalability to serve mission-critical needs. Since our launch in 2010, our capabilities around performance and scale, rich identity functionality, deployment flexibility, and extensive integration and interoperability have been purpose-built to meet the specific requirements of global enterprises. Our ability to serve mission-critical needs in complex environments for large customers enables us to grow our base of large customers and expand within each of them.
▪Our differentiated SaaS architecture facilitates strong customer data protection and high performance. We enable our customers to choose how they want to deploy our software in their complex, heterogeneous environments—whether it be a self-managed deployment in their private or public cloud environments, our SaaS offering, or a combination of both.
▪Our proprietary tenant isolation approach is designed to enhance individual customers’ data security and sovereignty. We have improved upon a typical multi-tenant SaaS architecture by never commingling customer data with each other. In addition, our customers’ data resides only in locations that the customer chooses, which enables our customers to comply with data and privacy regulations, such as the GDPR in the European Union.
▪Our architecture does not limit performance of individual customers. Our architecture is designed to maximize performance by not throttling or rate limiting individual customer environments. We also protect against “noisy neighbor” issues so that load from one customer will not affect another customer’s performance.
▪Same codebase as our self-managed platform. Our SaaS offering leverages the same codebase as our self-managed offering, which enables us to create or modify functionality that can be released on both deployments, and enables our customers utilizing our self-managed deployment to add or migrate to our SaaS deployment more easily. We enable our customers to choose how they want to deploy our software in their complex, heterogeneous environments—whether it be a self- managed deployment in their private or public cloud environments, our SaaS offering, or a combination.
▪Designed to be deployable as SaaS or in public and private cloud environments using DevOps. Our platform utilizes Kubernetes and Docker containerization and is deployable with DevOps workflows, and has been certified to run in GCP, AWS, Azure, or can be run on a customer’s private cloud.
•Extensive integrations enable our platform to be the single view of identity and provide powerful extensibility in complex and heterogeneous environments. Our platform has extensive integration capabilities that enable us to integrate with the myriad of applications and infrastructures that exist within our enterprise customers’ heterogeneous IT environments. We are also able to leverage our Trust Network, an ecosystem of partners that extend our rich native functionality with additional vertical-specific authentication, biometrics, digital identity proofing, and risk management capabilities.
•Proven track record of innovation. We have consistently set the standard of innovation in the identity market, anticipating major market trends and introducing new capabilities to support them. We are a pioneer of the development of advanced capabilities, such as Identity of Everything, Intelligent Access Trees, Continuous Security, certifying deployments on public cloud and multi-cloud with DevOps, enterprise-grade SaaS, passwordless and usernameless authentication using FIDO2 Webauthn, and AI-based Autonomous Identity with proprietary algorithms to automate identity processes. We intend to continue investing to extend our leadership in the CIAM, AM, and IGA markets by developing or acquiring new products and technologies.
•Management team with deep identity domain expertise. Our management team’s collective experience and deep knowledge of the identity space allows us to maintain our position as an innovation leader. Our management team is a driving force behind our vision, mission, culture, and focus on customer success. Our leadership enables us to continuously deliver products that enterprises need and want. They are also critical in building upon our culture which we believe is vital to our success.

▪Contextual and Adaptive Risk-based Access. We provide an array of capabilities for helping support modern Zero Trust authorization architectures. We allow customers to combine identity and device information by leveraging the ability to capture user and device context during login and at every transaction level if needed and respond to contextual changes. During use, the context is recreated and compared to context during login, allowing customers to make access alterations such as automatic throttling, data redaction, or access denials dynamically.
▪Fine-grained Authorization. In addition to creating detailed policies for specific user groups, permissions, and environments, our policy engine can be used to protect custom and non-HTTP-based resources such as objects, data, and IoT components.
▪API and Microservices Security. Our platform secures API endpoints and microservices including ingress/egress control, throttling, and authentication with our identity-aware proxy gateways, Identity Gateway and Microservices Security.
▪Secure Impersonation and Data Sharing. Our platform allows users to provide access to data or accounts on behalf of others in a secure and auditable way without the need to share credentials or passwords.
Identity Governance – Our Identity Governance product manages and reduces risk to enterprises from users having excessive or unnecessary access to applications, systems, devices, and data and includes the following capabilities:
•Access Requests. We allow users to request access to systems or applications through integration with help desk or service ticketing systems which can then be routed automatically according to business- defined identity workflows for 
approvals. Administrators can also use our platform to provide users with automated, policy-based access based on identity and role assignments.
•Access Reviews and Certifications. We allow business line managers or other users with access rights validation to quickly grant, enforce, or revoke secure access to systems and applications according to established business policies and workflows, to increase workforce productivity.
•Segregation of Duties. We provide a unified view of the entitlement landscape across the enterprise, minimizing risk of segregation of duties violations that could result in a security risk or possible internal fraud.
•Role and Entitlement Management. Many enterprises have different and multiple environments for their applications and services. We enable a centralized and unified view of identities, roles, and entitlements so that they can be easily managed via an extensible model.
•Policy Management. We allow enterprises to define, apply, and enforce compliance policies in a preventive and detective manner, preventing toxic access combinations and ensuring regulatory compliance. Administrators can also use our platform to define policies based on the relationships between different types of identities.
•Identity Workflows. We enable enterprises to connect their business processes with identity events, such as identity synchronization and reconciliation, across identity infrastructures, allowing for appropriate reviews and administrative action, to reduce enterprise risk.
•Reporting and Analytics. We provide out-of-the box reporting and ad hoc querying to enable enterprises to stay on top of their identity programs and compliance postures.
AI-powered Autonomous Identity – Our Autonomous Identity product provides an enterprise-wide view of access and streamlines and automates governance processes and reduces risk related to digital identities and includes the following capabilities:
•Predictive Confidence Scores for Access. Using proprietary AI algorithms, our platform analyzes enterprise data to assign confidence scores for provisioned access, which highlights anomalies that should be further actioned.
•Overprovisioned Access Detection and Access Revocation Recommendations. Our platform displays enterprise entitlements graphically on a user interface console to help easily detect over-provisioned access that could pose a security risk and identify high-risk access entitlement assignments that are candidates for access revocation.
•Outlier Detection. Our platform flags any provisioned access for remedial action that is an outlier to predicted normal patterns.
•Identity Automation Recommendations. Our platform reduces the burden on managers who otherwise must manually approve new entitlements by automatically approving high confidence, low-risk access requests and automating the re-certification of entitlements.
•Role Mining and Recommendations. Our platform is designed to enable intelligent role mining by identifying redundant roles and making recommendations to reduce the number of roles in the enterprise, which can significantly improve an enterprise’s ongoing security posture.
•Joiner, Mover, Leaver Access Automation. Our platform provides users with the access to applications they need to be rapidly productive during the worker lifecycle without manual review and fulfillment.
•Automated Approvals and Certifications. Our platform can automate approvals and ensure that IAM and IGA systems are compliant for regulatory standards and audits by tracking assigned entitlements.
Our Technology
Our differentiated architecture and design unify Identity Management, Access Management and Governance in one end-to-end platform. It also leverages the same underlying architecture across all identity types and use cases, enabling rapid development and innovation. The technical differentiators of our platform include:
•Intelligent Access Trees. Our platform includes Intelligent Access Trees, which leverage a visual designer with a drag-and-drop interface that allows enterprises to easily orchestrate, personalize, and secure user journeys to deliver meaningful user experiences without compromising security. These journeys can incorporate real-time digital signals such as device, contextual, behavioral, analytics, and risk-based factors to provide more personalized experiences that incorporate user-choice, omni-channel user recognition and better security.
•“Identity of Everything.” While traditional IAM struggles to manage non-human identities, our flexible data model can define any kind of identity object and its attributes, which provides enterprises the flexibility of managing multiple identity types, including non-human identities.
•Open Platform. Our platform was built to integrate with complex enterprise environments, which consist of heterogeneous cloud and data center environments, myriad on-premise and SaaS applications, corporate- and personally-owned devices, and emerging IoT services. Enterprises need cohesiveness across their IT environments and we make this possible through our technology stack:
•Identity Gateway. Our Identity Gateway is a lightweight, flexible, and high-performance proxy that can provide identity services and security to web or application traffic. Acting as a bridge between legacy and modern web applications and identity management platforms, it enables the transition of identity integration of the application from legacy to modern.
•SDKs. Our SDKs allow developers to quickly integrate identity to web or mobile applications without needing to understand the inner-workings of identity. Leveraging our Intelligent Access Trees, the SDKs step through each stage of a user journey via callbacks empowering developers to build applications that can handle changes in journeys in real time without the need to redeploy the application. They have the option to collect device profile information and automatically generate device fingerprints into the user’s profile.
•Microservices Security. Our lightweight, high performance sidecar proxy can be deployed directly into the namespace of microservices to provide east-west service-to-service security while integrating identity into the services.
•Policy Agents. Our policy agents are designed to plug directly into application servers to ease integration of identity into legacy applications, protecting them from unauthorized access.
•Identity Edge Controller. We provide a device-embeddable controller that can bring identity security to the edge of where code runs, including physical things.
•ICF Connectors. We leverage the standards-based Identity Connector Framework (ICF) to connect to multiple systems and applications by provisioning and synchronizing identities between them.
•APIs. Our platform is REST API enabled, which provides enterprises with the flexibility to integrate deeply.
•Extensibility. We provide extensive hook points in the platform that enable enterprises to extend core functionality with plug-ins and scripting to meet virtually any business need.
•Open Standards. We provide support for major identity standards such as OAuth2, SAML, OIDC, and SCIM, and we embrace new open standards such as delivering an early integration with FIDO2 WebAuthn passwordless authentication standards or the UMA protocol.
•Scale and Performance. Our platform is used to manage billions of identities globally. This is made possible by some key design principles:
•High Availability. Our applications including our next-generation directory services provide the ability to deploy in highly-available configurations that provide resiliency against unforeseen events as well as the ability to perform maintenance with no downtime.
•Stateless and Stateful Session Management. Our highly flexible session management enables both stateless and stateful sessions. Stateless session management allows for highly distributed elastic deployments with nearly unlimited horizontal scalability. Stateful session management enables complex, multi-site failover environments to always be highly available to end-users.
•Horizontally Scalable. Our platform allows deployments to be horizontally scaled to meet the most demanding performance requirements.
•SaaS Architecture. Our proprietary SaaS architecture has been purpose-built to solve real world enterprise problems, recognizing that most enterprises have complex IT environments and need a IAM solution that fits their environments.
•Multi-tenant SaaS with Complete Tenant Isolation. Our proprietary SaaS architecture provides multi-tenant service with complete tenant isolation. Because each customer tenant in our Cloud is isolated, they are insulated from performance concerns arising from other customer usage. Furthermore, being isolated means a customer’s data is not co-mingled with any others.
•One Platform, Any Cloud. ForgeRock utilizes one core platform for all deployment scenarios, SaaS and self-managed. This enables enterprises to meet their IT requirements with the same technology and enables an easier transition from on-premise to cloud for their applications and workloads.
•Extreme Flexibility. The ForgeRock Identity Cloud treats both cloud and on-premise applications the same way. It can even co-exist with other legacy IAM solutions running on premise. Enterprises can also quickly augment legacy systems with new capabilities such as Intelligent Access Trees and multi-factor authentication while planning and executing on their cloud migration strategy.
•Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery Compatible. Identity is a critical enterprise technology and needs protection from user mistakes, such as accidentally deleting a critical configuration or set of identities. The ForgeRock Identity Cloud provides development, staging, and production environments, and both staging and production environments are immutable, so that changes are promoted from one environment to the next, protecting enterprises from unexpected changes or mistakes.
•Proprietary AI Technology. Our proprietary AI technology deploys using a microservices architecture that scales linearly as the load increases. It is capable of quickly processing millions of access points and allows enterprises to configure the machine learning process and prune less productive rules. Enterprises can run analyses, predictions, and recommendations frequently to improve the machine learning process. Our Analytics Engine provides transparent and explainable results that lets enterprises get insight into why end-users have the access they have or what access they should have.
Our Customers
Our customer base includes many of the world’s leading brands and includes direct and indirect customers, of which direct customers are those we contract with directly (whether sourced by us or through a partner or reseller), and indirect customers include customers that receive the benefit of using components of our software by contracting with certain third parties such as resellers, system integrators, managed service providers, or other channel partners, as well as with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). 
We focus on the number of large customers because it represents our ability to land-and-expand with large enterprises and the number of large customers is a key indicator of our ability to grow our business and revenue in future periods. We define a large customer as a customer with $100,000 or greater Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) as of a measurement date. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had 394, 325 and 275 large customers with $100,000 of ARR or greater, respectively, representing 90%, 86% and 81% of our total ARR as of such dates. All of our large customers are direct customers. No single customer accounted for more than 3% of our total ARR or 10% of our total revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
Our customers are based in more than 50 countries and across a diverse set of industries.

•strength of sales and marketing efforts, including partner relationships;
•global reach and customer base;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•innovation and thought leadership; and
•quality of professional services and customer support.
We believe we compete favorably on these factors. However, some of our current and potential future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger market share, larger existing user bases and greater financial, technical, and other resources.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend, and enforce our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and certain other jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property rights. We also license certain software and other intellectual property from third parties for integration into our product solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned two issued U.S. patent and 16 pending U.S. patent applications relating to certain aspects of our technology. Our two issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2039 and 2040, assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other fees, and without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions. We cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Our existing patents and any patents that are issued in the future may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable, narrowed in scope or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating them or any of our other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our technology infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates their intellectual property rights. With regard to our brand, we have registered “ForgeRock” as a trademark in the United States, the European Union, Norway, and China. We have significant international operations and intend to continue to expand these operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
We control access to, and use of, our solutions and other confidential and proprietary information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, partners, and other third parties. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, contractual provisions, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology, trade secrets, or proprietary or confidential information, and such risks may increase as we attempt to expand into jurisdictions where such rights are less easily enforced, or are more subject to reverse engineering or misappropriation due to local legal requirements. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to data privacy, protection and security, intellectual property, employment and labor, workplace safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery, import and export controls, immigration, federal securities, and tax. In addition, we are subject to various laws and regulations 
relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts with our customers in heavily regulated industries and the public sector, which affect how we and our partners do business with such customers. Additional laws and regulations relating to these areas likely will be passed in the future, and these or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted or enforced in new or expanded manners, each of which could result in significant limitations on how we operate our business. New and evolving laws and regulations, and changes in their enforcement and interpretation, may require changes to our platform, offerings or business practices, and may significantly increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As our business expands to include additional platform functionalities and offerings, and our operations continue to expand internationally, our compliance requirements and costs may increase, and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
See the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity
Many jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting or revising privacy, data protection or information security legislation, including laws, rules and regulations applying to the collection, use, storage, transfer, disclosure, or other processing of personal data, including for purposes of marketing and other communications.
For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020 and established a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours. The CCPA broadly defines personal information and gave California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for severe civil penalties and statutory damages for violations and a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”). Effective in most material respects starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business. The CPRA also establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing the CCPA and the CPRA. Other state legislatures are currently contemplating, and have passed or may pass, their own comprehensive data privacy and security laws, with potentially greater penalties and more rigorous compliance requirements relevant to our business. Following the enactment of the CCPA, in 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act of 2021, and Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act, each of which shares similarities with the CCPA. Additionally, many state legislatures have already adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security, data breaches, and the protection of sensitive and personal information.
Internationally, many jurisdictions have established their own legal frameworks governing privacy, data protection, and information security with which we may need to comply. For example, the EU has adopted the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and contains numerous requirements and changes from previously existing EU law, including more robust obligations on data processors and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. The GDPR requires data controllers to implement more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, transparent and expanded disclosure to data subjects about how their personal data is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements, and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the United States. Other countries have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency or restricting the international transfer of data. Additionally, many jurisdictions outside the United States and EEA in which we have operations or for which such jurisdictions’ laws or regulations may apply to us or our operations, including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Singapore, maintain laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security that provide for extensive obligations in connection with the use, collection, protection, and processing of personal data. Many of these legal regimes provide for substantial fines, penalties, or other consequences for noncompliance. We may be required to implement new measures or policies, or change our existing policies and measures or the features of our platform, in an effort to comply with U.S. and international laws, rules, and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, which may require us to expend substantial financial and other resources and which may otherwise be difficult to undertake.
Although we are working to comply with applicable federal, state, and foreign laws, rules and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, rules, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our platform.
Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws, rules or regulations, industry standards, our internal or external privacy policies, contractual or other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any actual, perceived or suspected security breach or incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, unavailability of, or acquisition, release, transfer, or other processing of personal data or other data, may result in enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, significant fines, penalties and censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, regulatory inquiries and investigations or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. For more information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Environment — We are subject to stringent laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and information security. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, the privacy or security provisions of our privacy policy, our contracts or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in proceedings, actions or penalties against us and materially adversely affect our business.”
Our Culture and People
Our People
Our most valuable asset is our people. ForgeRock is the place where the best people do their best work. As of December 31, 2021, we had 786 full-time employees, of which approximately 48% were in the United States and 52% were in our international locations. We supplement our workforce with contractors and consultants. We strive to drive a positive employee experience and maintain a good relationship with our people. Our priority is to attract the best, diverse workforce and at the same time, engage and grow our global team. 
Values
Our culture and values are critical to our success. Our values guide our interactions, business, our product development, our practices and our brand. Our values have delivered tangible financial and operational benefits for our customers, employees and stockholders. As our company continues to evolve and grow, these six values remain constant:
Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging 
Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging are how we talk about our business. It is not just about listening and responding to our employees but about the focus and commitment to becoming more inclusive and demonstrating that in our actions and results. 
Creating a workplace that is safe, supportive and inclusive attracts talent and helps ensure our current talent stays and grows at ForgeRock.
Compensation, Benefits and Wellness 
ForgeRock provides robust compensation, global benefits and wellness programs that help support the varying needs of our employees. In addition to market-competitive base pay, short-term incentives and long-term equity incentives, our total rewards program includes comprehensive employee benefits and a variety of other health and wellness resources. We are committed to fair compensation and opportunity in our workplace. We have a pay for performance framework, including market reference range scale for compensation, and an always-on performance evaluation and feedback system. Wellness is embedded in our benefits and the employee engagements we design. The overall health and safety of each of our employees is imperative. It is important with the evolving landscape of hybrid work.
In addition, we are intentional in our approach to supporting the mental well-being of our people. Our value of “Balance Matters” encourages our people to take the time to ensure both professional and personal commitments get the attention they require. We have hosted mental and emotional health workshops and speaking events as well as provide mental health resources and access to support throughout our locations.
Future of Work
ForgeRock has a mission to enable our customers to simply and safely access the connected world. Those two sentiments, simple and safe, are at the center of our launch into a new way of working. Our beliefs and strategies are helping us shape the vision around the future of work at ForgeRock. Since the pandemic began, we have used a data driven approach to determine how we would ensure the health and safety of our people while continuing to deliver for our customers and partners. Our employees have adapted incredibly well to the changing work environment with many team members on-boarding during the COVID-19 pandemic. We embrace a level of flexibility as it relates to how and where we do our work. 
We know that work styles and preferences are different for everyone. Similar to our business philosophy and how we serve our customers, we do not apply a one-size-fits-all approach to how we work. We believe work is what you do, not where you do it. We are flexible and balance the needs of our people while also working to accommodate individual work preferences and supporting the health, safety and wellness of our people. 
Growth and Development
One of our values is “Grow and Learn” and for that we continue to invest resources to develop talent and actively foster a learning culture where employees are empowered to grow personally and professionally. We offer new employee induction/onboarding and training programs to prepare our employees for career growth and individual development. We know that managers play an important role in how our employees feel about their work and their impact and the potential for growth. For that reason we are investing in the capabilities of our leaders through enablement sessions, coaching and external thought leadership.
