Item 1. Business.
 
FG Group Holdings Inc. (“FG Group Holdings”, the “Company”, “us” or “we”), formerly known as Ballantyne Strong, Inc., has an operating history of over 90 years and has been a publicly traded company since 1995. Our shares are traded on the NYSE American market under the symbol “FGH.” Our website is fg.group. The inclusion of our Internet address in this Annual Report does not include or incorporate by reference into this Annual Report any information on our website. Effective December 23, 2022, we changed our name from Ballantyne Strong, Inc. to FG Group Holdings Inc. by filing a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Also effective December 23, 2022, the Company changed its corporate domicile from Delaware to Nevada (the “Reincorporation”) by merging with and into a newly-formed corporation, FG Group Holdings Inc. (Nevada), which was incorporated in the State of Nevada for that purpose, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 19, 2022, and is now known as FG Group Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation.
 
We operate Strong Entertainment, which has a leadership position in supplying projection screens and related products and services to the cinema exhibition and entertainment industry. We have capital allocated to equity holdings in three companies and also operate a technology incubator and co-working facility in Alpharetta, Georgia where we also own the land and building.
 
Our strategic plans contemplate a combination of:
 

● | Expanding our Strong Entertainment operating business, organically and through complimentary transactions following a planned separation and initial public offering;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Maximizing the value of our holdings by strategically allocating additional capital, monetizing positions, and redeploying capital; and 
● | Managing public company costs to minimize overhead levels at the holding company level. 

 
We believe Strong Entertainment has established a leadership position in the entertainment industry, providing mission critical products and services to cinema exhibitors and entertainment venues for over 90 years. We intend to focus on growing and increasing the scope, scale and value of our Strong Entertainment operating business.
 
We have been focused on improving operating performance and positioning the group for accelerated growth following a period of COVID-19 related industry disruptions. Entering 2023, management is focused on growth opportunities, including a combination of organic growth and expansion through strategic transactions in the Entertainment business.
 
As part of that strategy, the Company announced plans to establish the Strong Entertainment business as a separate publicly listed company. Following the planned separation, the operations of the Strong Entertainment operating segment are expected to become part of a newly established British Columbia corporation, Strong Global Entertainment, Inc. (“Strong Global Entertainment”). Strong Global Entertainment filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and intends to commence an initial public offering of its common shares to raise additional capital to support its growth plans. If successful, we expect to apply to have the Strong Global Entertainment common shares trade on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol “SGE” following the initial public offering, and the Company expects to continue to be the majority shareholder of Strong Global Entertainment.
 
The Company also continues to evaluate capital allocation opportunities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held equity stakes in three separate companies. Firefly Systems, Inc. (“Firefly”) operates a media network and digital advertising solutions on taxi and rideshare vehicles. FG Financial Holdings, LLC, (“FGF Holdings”) which owns common and preferred shares of FG Financial Group, Inc. (“FGF”), which operates as a reinsurance and asset management holding company focused on collateralized and loss capped reinsurance and merchant banking, and GreenFirst Forest Products Inc (“GreenFirst”), a leading producer in the Canadian timber market. In February 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Ignition, LLC, completed the purchase of the land and building housing its Digital Ignition business in Alpharetta, Georgia.
 
Fundamental Global GP, LLC (“Fundamental Global”), the entities that it manages, its other affiliates, and the directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates together held approximately 34.6% of the Company’s outstanding stock as of March 10, 2023. In some cases, entities managed by Fundamental Global may acquire positions in the same public companies as the Company. Fundamental Global’s entities  currently hold positions in FGF and GreenFirst.
 
Strong Entertainment Overview
 
As noted above, we have announced plans to establish the Strong Entertainment business as a separate publicly listed company. Following the planned separation, the operations of our Strong Entertainment operating segment are expected to become part of a newly established British Columbia corporation, Strong Global Entertainment. The information provided below describes the historical operation of our Strong Entertainment business segment, rather than as a standalone operating company.

Overview
 
Our Strong Entertainment business segment manufactures and distributes premium large format projection screens, and provides comprehensive managed services, technical support and related products and services primarily to cinema exhibitors, theme parks, educational institutions, and similar venues. We also distribute and support third party products, including digital projectors, servers, library management systems, menu boards and sound systems.
 
As a manufacturer and distributor of projection screens systems, we have contractual relationships to supply projection screens to major cinema exhibitors, including IMAX Corporation (“IMAX”), AMC Entertainment Holdings (“AMC”), Marcus Theaters (“Marcus”), and Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (“Cinemark”), and other cinema operators worldwide. In addition to traditional projection screens, we also manufacture and distribute our Eclipse curvilinear screens, which are specially designed for theme parks, immersive exhibitions, as well as simulation applications.
 
We provide maintenance, repair, installation, network support services and other services to cinema operators, primarily in the United States. Many of our customers choose annual managed service arrangements for maintenance and repair services. We also provide maintenance services to customers on a time and materials basis. Our field service and Network Operations Center (“NOC”) staff work hand in hand to monitor and resolve system and other issues for our customers. Our NOC, staffed by software engineers and systems technicians, operates 24/7/365 and monitors our customers’ networked equipment remotely, often providing proactive solutions to systems’ issues before they cause system failures.
 
In March 2022, we launched Strong Studios, Inc., (“Strong Studios”) a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Strong Technical Services, Inc. The goal in launching Strong Studios is to expand our Entertainment Business to include content creation and production of feature films and series. The launch of Strong Studios is intended to further diversify our revenue streams and increase our addressable markets, while leveraging our existing relationships in the industry.
 
The coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”) and inflationary pressures have been posing and may continue to pose challenges for our business. The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant impact to consumer behaviors and our customers, particularly our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our products and services. A significant number of our customers temporarily ceased operations at times during the height of the pandemic and continued to operate under COVID-19 restrictions for portions of 2022. As such, we have experienced, and may continue to experience an impact on our results of operations. We believe that consumer reticence to engage in outside-the-home activities, caused by the risk of contracting COVID-19, is abating, and our customers have resumed more typical, pre-COVID-19 purchasing behaviors. There can be no assurances, however, that there will be no further resurgence or variants of COVID-19 which could reverse the current trend.
 
Products and Services
 
Projection Screens and Support Systems — We believe we are the largest manufacturer and distributor of premium large format projection screens to the cinema industry in North America. We have contractual relationships to supply projection screens to major cinema exhibitors, including IMAX, AMC, Marcus, and Cinemark, and many other cinema operators worldwide. We also manufacture innovative screen support structures custom built to adapt to virtually any venue requirement, with a unique self-standing modular construction that allows for easy assembly and adjustable size.
 
In addition to traditional projection screens, we also manufacture and distribute our Eclipse curvilinear screens, which are specially designed for theme parks, immersive exhibitions, as well as simulation applications. Our Eclipse curvilinear screens are specially designed to provide maximum viewer engagement in media-based attractions and immersive projection environments. The solid surface minimizes light loss to maintain higher resolution at lower lumen output. Patented speaker panels allow selective placement of rear mounted speakers to ensure the audio derives from the source media on screen. Applications include interactive dark rides, 3D/4D theme park rides, flying theaters and motion simulators.
 
We believe that our screens are the highest quality in the industry providing the highest gain and other characteristics important to the exhibitor and its patrons. Our high quality is driven by our innovative manufacturing process, focus on quality control and our proprietary coatings. We believe we are the only major screen manufacturer that develops and produces its own proprietary coatings, which are critical to the overall quality, increased screen reflectivity and brightness, and continued innovation of our screens.
 
Technical Services – We provide digital projection equipment installation and after-sale maintenance and network support services to the entertainment industry. Our field service technicians and NOC staff work hand in hand to monitor and resolve system and other issues for our customers. We service many of our customers under recurring revenue contracts providing for maintenance and repair to a wide range of installed digital equipment, providing our customers with a reliable turnkey outsourced service option. We also provide services to customers on a time and materials basis. Our NOC, staffed by software engineers and systems techs, operates 24/7/365 and monitors our customers’ networked equipment remotely, often providing proactive solutions to systems’ issues before they cause system failures.

Content – In March 2022, we launched our Strong Studios division, expanding our Entertainment Business to include content creation and production of feature films and series. The launch of Strong Studios further diversifies our revenue streams and increases our addressable markets, while leveraging our existing relationships in the industry. Strong Studios acquired original feature films and television series from Landmark Studio Group LLC (“Landmark”), a Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc. (Nasdaq: CCSE) (“CSSE”) company, and was assigned third party rights to content for global multiplatform distribution. One new scripted television series, Safehaven, commenced production in 2022, and another scripted television series, Flagrant, is expected to begin production in 2023. The Company has agreed to sell the distribution rights of Safehaven to Screen Media Ventures LLC (“SMV”), a subsidiary of CSSE, for a total of $6.5 million, and we will also participate in a share of the profits of the series.
 
Other Products – We distribute projectors, servers, audio systems and other third-party products including library management systems, lenses and lamps to customers in North and South America.
 
Markets
 
We sell our screen systems worldwide, with our primary markets being North America and Asia. Screen systems are primarily sold on a direct basis, although we also use third-party distributors and integrators in some markets.
 
We have non-exclusive distribution agreements with NEC and Barco that allow us to market digital projectors in North and South America. We also have a preferred commercial relationship with Cinionic, Inc., the world’s leading provider of laser cinema solutions, to enhance the services to operators across North America. We believe this relationship enhances our ability to service our valued customers by providing increased access to technology and better training for our technicians and will strengthen our global reach due to closer relationships with their international sales teams.
 
We provide technical services in the United States. We market and sell our services both directly to theater owners and other entertainment-related markets and through dealers or Value Added Reseller (“VAR”) networks.
 
Competition
 
There are several other companies that manufacture and distribute projection screens. We believe that our primary competitors in the worldwide projection screen market include Harkness Screens International Ltd., Severtson, Screen Solutions, Spectro, MECHANISCHE Weberei BOHEMIA s.r.o. and Galalite Projection Screens. Competitive factors include product performance characteristics, quality, availability, location/shipping logistics and price.
 
The market for our other digital cinema equipment and technical services is highly competitive, and the industry is fragmented. The primary competitive factors are price, product quality, features and customer support. Competition in the digital cinema equipment market includes other integrators and resellers. Manufacturers may also sell equipment directly to exhibitors, especially for large orders. We believe that our primary competition for installation, after-sale maintenance, and NOC services is Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc., Moving Image Technologies, and Sonic Equipment Company. We also compete with in-house technical resources at some of our larger entertainment customers for services work.
 
In our new content business, we also compete with numerous independent motion picture and television production companies. Given such competition and our stage of development, we emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies.
 
Entertainment Industry Trends and Positioning
 
We believe that the following trends positively impact our outlook for the entertainment industry:
 

● | Post-COVID-19 Recovery — We believe there is pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment that will drive favorable trends post-COVID-19 in the cinema exhibition and theme park industries. For example: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◌ | Avatar: The Way of Water ranks in the top 10 of highest grossing films globally of all time 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◌ | Domestic box office gross receipts during 2022 increased approximately 64% over 2021 
◌ | The Batman was IMAX’s largest March opening since 2019 
◌ | Spider-man ranks #3 of top grossing films domestically of all time 
◌ | Spider-man delivered Cinemark’s biggest opening night of all time

● | Blockbuster Studio Releases – According to the Hollywood Reporter, “Box Office Rebound: “Exhibitor Carnage Is in the Past,” the pace of Hollywood blockbuster movies scheduled for release to cinemas is poised to accelerate and is already creating stronger-than-expected demand trends. According to CNBC, 2023 is expected to have a much stronger slate of films than 2022, both in terms of number of films and diversity of content. These factors, along with the return of exclusive theatrical releases, is encouraging industry analysts who are predicting movie theaters to rebound to near pre-pandemic levels by 2023. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing Trend of Outsourcing in the Cinema Industry — We believe that cinema operators are increasing their use of outsourced services as they seek to reduce internal operating costs and maintain operational flexibility post-COVID-19. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Upgrade Cycle from Xenon to Laser Projection — We believe the transition from xenon projection to laser protection in the cinema exhibition industry will accelerate and continue over the next decade. Several exhibitors have publicly discussed plans to upgrade to an all-laser projection strategy, notably Cinemark and IMAX, to further improve the quality of the theatrical experience. In addition, in April 2022, AMC announced an agreement with Cinionic, Inc. to install Barco laser projectors in 3,500 of its U.S. auditoriums through 2026. We expect this upgrade cycle to drive increased demand for screen replacement as well as for our services to de-install, install and upgrade new and existing projection equipment. 
● | Consolidating Industry – The cinema exhibition industry was consolidating via mergers and acquisitions pre-COVID-19. We expect consolidation of the supplier side of the cinema exhibition industry to accelerate post-COVID-19. 


● | Growing Demand for Content and Acceleration of New Streaming Services – The global entertainment business continues to grow and evolve, with the following factors contributing to increasingly favorable environment for content: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | ◌ Spending for new content continues to rise — In 2022, the top nine streaming giants spent $140.5 billion on content, and with a projected 10% annual increase, they are expected to increase that spend to a combined $172 billion by 2025. ◌ Global subscribers to streaming services is up — Since 2019, the number of global customers subscribing to streaming video platforms has grown from 642 million to more than 1.1 billion, a 71% leap. Over the next few years, this rise is expected to continue to 1.6 billion in 2025. ◌ Spending in Indie content continues to surge – As much as Netflix and the five major Hollywood Studios spend producing their own content, independently made and acquired content accounts for twice as much money globally. The independent market grew 21.4% in 2022, increasing to approximately$69 billion in 2022. 

 
We believe the following strength and attributes position Strong Global Entertainment for accelerating growth:
 

● | Partnerships with Industry Leaders — We believe our reputation for superior quality and customer service have made us the go-to screen provider for many of the leading operators in the industry. We provide projection screens and managed services to all of the top cinema operators in North America, including AMC, IMAX, Cinemark, Regal and many other regional cinema operators. We believe that we provide a majority of the large format projection screens used by the major operators in North America, including exclusive supply contracts with AMC and Cinemark, and we believe we also supply IMAX with substantially all of its projection screens globally. There is greater pressure on theaters to differentiate their experience from the at-home experience. We believe the global trend for premium entertainment plays to Strong Global Entertainment’s strengths. The table below includes the top cinema companies in North America, all of which are our customers: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Innovator in the Industry — We are constantly innovating as exemplified by our new, rapidly growing Eclipse curvilinear screen division which specially designs screens with proprietary coatings for maximum viewer engagement in media-based attractions and immersive projection environments. Recently our screens were used in the much publicized Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience exhibit that wowed audiences with its all-encompassing experience of art, light, sound, movement and imagination. We also recently collaborated with Illuminarium Intermediate (Cayman), LLC in Atlanta, Georgia and plan to assist them in other cities as they expand their sensory cinema business. Eclipse screens are also used in theme parks and military simulation applications.

● | Turn-Key, Vertically Integrated Partner — We offer a comprehensive turn-key solution for our customers, offering projection and audio equipment, projection screen systems, as well as installation, break/fix on demand and outsourced managed services providing customers with a one-stop shop for their needs.

● | World-Class and Scalable Manufacturing and Research & Development (“R&D”) — We manufacture our screens in an approximately 80,000 square-foot facility in Joliette, Quebec, Canada (the “Joliette Plant”) that we plan to lease on a long term basis from Strong/MDI (as defined below). The Joliette Plant is unique with two 90-foot-high screen coating towers which allows us to produce and finish large screens to precise specifications. The Joliette Plant also includes polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) welding operations with programmable automations and areas dedicated to the manufacture of our paints and coatings used on all our screens, as well as dedicated in-house chemists and R&D capabilities. We believe that our quality control procedures, in-house paint and coating capabilities and the quality standards for the products that we manufacture contribute significantly to our reputation for high performance and reliability. 
● | Strong Studios launches with proven management and a portfolio of content and projects - In March 2022, we launched Strong Studios with an experienced team and the acquisition of rights to a slate of motion picture and television series from Landmark. One new scripted television series, Safehaven, commenced production in 2022, and another scripted television series, Flagrant, is expected to begin production in 2023. The Company has agreed to sell the distribution rights of Safehaven to SMV for a total of $6.5 million, and we will also participate in a share of the profits of the series.

Quality Control
 
We believe that our quality control procedures and the quality standards for the products that we manufacture, distribute or service have contributed significantly to our reputation for high performance and reliability. The inspection of incoming materials and components as well as the testing of all of our products during various stages of the sales and service cycle are key elements of this program.
Trademarks
 
We own or otherwise have rights to various trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with the sale of our products. We believe our success will not be dependent upon trademark protection, but rather upon our scientific and engineering capabilities and research and production techniques. We consider the Strong® trademark to be of value to our business. FG is a registered trademark of Fundamental Global.
Human Capital Resources
 
We employed 175 persons at December 31, 2022, 174 of which were full-time. Of these employees, 82 positions were considered manufacturing or operational, 50 were service related and 43 were considered sales and administrative. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.
 
The Company believes it complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the Company operates. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status. We continue to monitor our demand for skilled and unskilled labor and provide training and competitive compensation packages in an effort to attract and retain skilled employees.
 
The Company, including its subsidiaries, remains deeply rooted in cinema screen manufacturing and cinema- focused services. In this regard, we continuously drive our efforts to be the best partner for our customers, investment for our stockholders, neighbor in our community and to provide an empowering work environment for our employees.
 
Moreover, the Company is committed to the health, safety and wellness of its employees. We have modified our business practices and implemented certain policies at our offices in accordance with best practices to accommodate, and at times mandate, social distancing and remote work practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhanced sanitary measures in our facilities, and cancelling attendance at events and conferences. In addition, we have invested in employee safety equipment, additional cleaning supplies and measures, re-designed production lines and workplaces as necessary and adapted new processes for interactions with our suppliers and customers to safely manage our operations.
 
Regulation
 
We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, environmental, safety and health requirements; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy; labor and employment; competition; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.
 
Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products. There can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost.
