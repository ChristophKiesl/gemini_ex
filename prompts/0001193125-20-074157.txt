Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

General 
 Riverview Financial Corporation (the Company) was formed in 2013 as a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania. The Company is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) or (FRB). The Company provides a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Riverview Bank (the Bank), which is its sole operating segment. The Company had approximately 276 employees as of December 31, 2019. 
 The Bank is a state-chartered bank and trust company regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (DOB) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that offers financial services through 27 community banking offices and three limited purpose offices. 
 Effective October 1, 2017, the Company merged with CBT Financial Corp. (CBT) and its subsidiary, CBT Bank, merged with and into the Bank. The merger of equals with CBT added approximately $382.5 million in loans and $438.8 million in deposits to the consolidated Company. 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this annual report to the Company, Bank, we, us and our refer to Riverview Financial Corporation, its direct and indirect subsidiaries and its and their respective predecessors. 
 We primarily generate income through interest income derived from our loan and securities portfolios. Other income is generated primarily from transaction fees, trust and wealth management fees, mortgage banking fees and service charges on deposit accounts. Our primary costs are interest paid on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We provide a variety of commercial and retail banking and financial services to businesses, non-profit organizations, governmental and municipal agencies, professional customers, and retail customers, on a personalized basis. 
 Market Areas 
 The Banks market area consists of Berks, Blair, Bucks, Centre, Clearfield, Cumberland, Dauphin, Huntingdon, Lebanon, Lehigh, Lycoming, Perry, Schuylkill and Somerset Counties in Central Pennsylvania. 
 Products and Services 
 The Bank offers a variety of consumer and commercial banking products and services throughout its market area. Our primary lending products are real estate, commercial and consumer loans. Our primary deposit products are NOW, demand deposit accounts, and certificate of deposit accounts. We also offer ATM access, investment accounts, trust department services and other various lending, depository and related financial services. 
Lending Activities 
 We provide a full range of retail and commercial lending products designed to meet the borrowing needs of consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses in our market area. A significant amount of our loans are made to customers located within our market area. We have no foreign loans or highly leveraged transaction loans, as defined by the Federal Reserve Board. Although we participate in loans originated by other banks, we have originated the majority of the loans in our portfolio. 
 Our primary commercial products are loans to small- and medium- sized businesses. Our consumer products include one-to-four family residential mortgages, consumer, automobile, home equity, educational and lines of credit loans. Our retail lending products include the following types of loans, among others: residential real estate; automobiles; manufactured housing; personal; student; and home equity. Our commercial lending products include the following types of loans, among others: commercial real estate; working capital; equipment and other commercial needs; construction; and agricultural and mineral rights. The terms offered on a loan vary depending on the type of loan and credit-worthiness of the borrower. We fund our loans, primarily, from our various deposit products which include certificates of deposits, savings, money market and various demand deposit accounts that are offered to both consumer and commercial customers.

 Payment risk is a function of the economic climate in which our lending activities are conducted. Economic downturns in the economy generally, or in a particular sector, could cause cash flow problems for our customers, impairing their ability to repay loans we make to them. We attempt to minimize this risk by avoiding loan concentrations to a single customer or a group of similar customer types, the loss of any one or more of whom would have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition. One element of interest rate risk arises from making fixed rate loans in an environment of changing interest rates. We attempt to mitigate this risk by making adjustable rate loans and by limiting repricing terms to five years or less for commercial customers requiring fixed rate loans. 
 Our lending activity also exposes us to the risk that any collateral we take as security is not adequate. We attempt to manage collateral risk by avoiding loan concentrations to particular types of borrowers, by perfecting liens on collateral and by obtaining appraisals on property prior to extending loans. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to these and other types of lending risks by stratifying authorization requirements by loan size and complexity. 
 We are not dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of one or more of which would have a materially adverse effect on our operations. In the ordinary course of our business, our operations and earnings are not materially affected by seasonal changes or by Federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations. 
 We intend to continue to evaluate commercial real estate, commercial business and governmental lending opportunities, including small business lending. We continue to proactively monitor and manage existing credit relationships. 
 We have not engaged in sub-prime residential mortgage lending, which is defined as mortgage loans advanced to borrowers who do not qualify for market interest rates because of problems with their credit history. We focus our lending efforts within our market area. 
 Deposit Activities 
 Our primary source of funds is the cash flow provided by our financing activities, mainly deposit gathering. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including, among others: money market accounts; NOW accounts; savings accounts; certificates of deposit; individual retirement accounts, and demand deposit accounts. These deposits are primarily obtained from areas surrounding our branch offices. We rely primarily on marketing, product innovation, technology, service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits. Other deposit related services include: mobile and online banking; remote deposit capture; automatic clearing house transactions; cash management services; automated teller machines; point of sale transactions; safe deposit boxes; night depository services; direct deposit; and official check services. 
Trust, Wealth Management and Brokerage Services 
 Through our trust department, we offer a broad range of fiduciary and investment services. Our trust and investment services include: 
 

 | investment management;
--+-----------------------


 | IRA trustee services;
--+----------------------


 | estate administration;
--+-----------------------


 | living trusts;
--+---------------


 | trustee under will;
--+--------------------


 | guardianships;
--+---------------


 | life insurance trusts;
--+-----------------------


 | custodial services / IRA custodial services;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | corporate trusts; and
--+----------------------


 | pension and profit sharing plans.
--+----------------------------------

 We provide a comprehensive array of wealth management products and services through Riverview Wealth Management and Trust Management divisions to individuals, small businesses and nonprofit entities. These products and services include the following, among others: investment portfolio management; brokerage; estate planning assistance; annuities; business succession planning; insurance; education funding strategies; and tax planning assistance.

 We have a third-party marketing agreement with a broker-dealer that allows us to offer a full range of securities, brokerage services and annuity sales to our customers. We have three dedicated locations that provide such investor services as well as accommodating customer meetings by appointment within our retail banking offices. Through these divisions, our clients have access to a wide array of financial products including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, annuities and insurance. 
 Competition 
 The banking and financial services industries are highly competitive. Within its geographic region, the Bank faces direct competition from other commercial banks, varying in size from local community banks to larger regional and nationwide banks, credit unions and non-bank entities. As a result of the wide availability of electronic delivery channels, the Bank also faces competition from financial institutions that do not have a physical presence in its geographic markets. 
 Many of our competitors are substantially larger in terms of assets and available resources. Certain of these institutions have significantly higher lending limits than we do and may provide various services to their customers that we presently do not. In addition, we experience competition for deposits from mutual funds and broker dealers, while consumer discount, mortgage and insurance companies compete with us for various types of loans. Credit unions, finance companies and mortgage companies enjoy certain competitive advantages over us, as they are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and taxation as commercial banks. Principal methods of competing for bank products, permitted nonbanking services and financial activities include price, nature of product, quality of service, convenience of location, and availability of banking convenience technology, including telephone and web-based banking services. 
 In our market area, interest rates on deposits, especially time deposits, and interest rates and fees charged to customers on loans are very competitive. In the current economic environment, we are experiencing increased competition in view of our loan demand and deposit gathering. 
 We believe that our most significant competitive advantage originates from our business philosophy, which includes offering direct access to senior management and other officers, providing friendly, informed and courteous service, local and timely decision making, flexible and reasonable operating procedures, and consistently applied credit policies. In addition, our success has been, and will continue to be, a result of our emphasis on community involvement and customer relationships. With consolidation continuing in the financial industry, and particularly in our market area, smaller community banks like us are gaining opportunities to increase market share as larger institutions reduce their emphasis on, or exit, the markets. 
 Seasonality 
 Generally, our operations are not seasonal in nature. Our deposit activities, however, have been somewhat influenced by fiscal funding appropriations related to municipalities and school districts in our market areas, which are to some extent seasonal in nature. 
Supervision and Regulation 
 We are extensively regulated and examined under federal and state laws. Generally, these laws and regulations are intended to protect consumers, not shareholders. The following is a summary description of certain provisions of law that affect the regulation of bank holding companies and banks. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. 
 The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) or (FRB). We are required to file annual and quarterly reports with the FRB and to provide the FRB with such additional information as the FRB may require. The FRB also conducts periodic examinations of the Company. In addition, under the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (DOB), the DOB has the authority to examine the books, records and affairs of the Company and to require any documentation deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the Pennsylvania Banking Code. 
 
5 


 With certain limited exceptions, we are required to obtain prior approval from the FRB before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any voting securities or substantially all assets of a bank or bank holding company, or before merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Additionally, with certain exceptions, any person or entity proposing to acquire control through direct or indirect ownership of 25% or more of our voting securities (or 10% or more under certain circumstances) is required to give 60 days written notice of the acquisition to the FRB, which may prohibit the transaction, and to publish notice to the public. 
 The Bank is primarily regulated by the DOB and the FDIC. The DOB may prohibit an institution, over which it has supervisory authority, from engaging in activities or investments that the agency believes constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Federal banking regulators have extensive enforcement authority over the institutions they regulate to prohibit or correct activities that violate law, regulation or a regulatory agreement or which are deemed to constitute unsafe or unsound practices. 
 Enforcement actions may include: 
 

 | the appointment of a conservator or receiver;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | the issuance of a cease and desist order;
--+------------------------------------------


 | the termination of deposit insurance, the imposition of civil money penalties on the institution, its directors, officers, employees and institution affiliated parties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the issuance of directives to increase capital;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | the issuance of formal and informal agreements and orders;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | the removal of or restrictions on directors, officers, employees and institution-affiliated parties; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the enforcement of any such mechanisms through restraining orders or any other court actions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons which generally require that such credit extensions be made on substantially the same terms as are available to third parties dealing with us, and do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Other laws limit the maximum amount that we may loan to any one customer as a percentage of our capital levels. 
 Permitted Non-Banking Activities 
 Generally, a bank holding company may not engage in any activities other than banking, managing or controlling its bank and other authorized subsidiaries, or providing service to those subsidiaries. With prior approval of the FRB, we may acquire more than 5% of the assets or outstanding shares of a company engaging in non-bank activities determined by the FRB to be closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. The FRB provides expedited procedures for expansion into approved categories of non-bank activities. A bank holding company that meets certain specified criteria may elect to be regulated as a financial holding company and thereby engage in a broader array of nonbanking financial activities, including insurance and investment banking. 
Limitations on Dividends and Other Payments and Transactions 
 Our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank. The Company relies on dividends from the Bank for its own ability to pay dividends to shareholders. Both federal and state laws impose restrictions on the ability of both the Company and the Bank to pay dividends. 
 Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or its subsidiaries, and on the use of their securities as collateral for loans. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Companys ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for the payment of dividends, interest and operating expenses. Further, subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements relating to any extension of credit, the lease or sale of property, or furnishing of services. 
 Under FRB regulations, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. The FRB may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank when required. A required capital injection may be called for at a time when the holding company does not have the resources to provide it. In addition, depository institutions insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any losses incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, in connection with the default of or assistance provided to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution. Such cross-guarantee liabilities generally are superior in priority to the obligation of the depository institutions to its shareholders, due solely to their status as shareholders, and obligations to other affiliates.

 Pennsylvania Law 
 As a Pennsylvania bank holding company, the Company is subject to various restrictions on its activities as set forth in Pennsylvania law. This is in addition to those restrictions set forth in federal law. Under Pennsylvania law, a bank holding company that desires to acquire a bank or bank holding company that has its principal place of business in Pennsylvania must obtain permission from the DOB. 
Risk-Based Capital Requirements 
 The federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital regulations to facilitate assessing capital adequacy of a banks operations for assets reported on the balance sheet and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse agreements, which are recorded as off-balance sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit-equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain US Treasury securities, to 100% or more for assets with relatively high credit risk. 
 A banks risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets, which include off-balance-sheet items, against both total qualifying capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 capital. 
 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital includes common equity and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions and retained earnings. 
 Tier 1, or core capital, includes common equity, non-cumulative preferred stock and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions. 
 Tier 2, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, limited life preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, mandatory convertible securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations less restricted deductions. The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies. 
 In July 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by federal law. The final rules established the following capital requirements: 
 A minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%. 
 A minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. 
 A minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. 
 A minimum leverage ratio of 4%. 
 In addition, the final rules established a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets applicable to all insured banks. If a bank fails to hold capital above the minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, it is subject to certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executives. The phase-in period for the capital conservation buffers for all banks began on January 1, 2016, with the full buffer applicable on January 1, 2019. 
 Under the rules, community banks were permitted to make a one-time election not to include Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) in regulatory capital and instead use the previously existing treatment that excluded most AOCI components from regulatory capital. The opt-out election was required to be made in the first call filed after the institution became subject to the final rule. The Bank opted-out of the inclusion of the components of AOCI in regulatory capital. 
 Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement actions including: 
 

 | limitations on its ability to pay dividends;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | the issuance by the applicable regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | or the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, as well as the measures described under FDICIA as applicable to undercapitalized institutions under the prompt corrective action regulation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy. Such a change could affect the ability of the Bank to grow and could restrict the amount of profits, if any, available for the payment of dividends to the Company. 
 At December 31, 2019, the Bank complied with the foregoing requirements with a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.5%, tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 9.1%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.5% and a total capital ratio of 12.4%. 
 Legislation enacted in May 2018 required the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish a community bank leverage ratio of between 8 to 10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirements and electing to follow the alternative framework are deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. In November 2019, the federal regulators issued a final rule that set the optional community bank leverage ratio at 9%, effective January 1, 2020. 
 Prompt Corrective Action Regulations 
 Under prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required, to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized banks. The extent of supervisory action depends upon the degree of the institutions undercapitalization. For this purpose, a bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on its capital level: 

 | well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% total risk-based capital and 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital and 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital or 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% total risk-based capital or 3% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 The regulations provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. Any holding company for the bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the banks assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC, or the amount necessary to restore the bank to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the FDIC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Various restrictions, including on growth and capital distributions, also apply to undercapitalized institutions. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital plan, it is treated as significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized institutions must comply with one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss officers or directors and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator within specified timeframes.

 At December 31, 2019, the Bank met the criteria for being considered well-capitalized. 
 The previously referenced final rule establishing an elective community bank leverage ratio regulatory capital requirement provides that a qualifying institution whose capital exceeds the community bank leverage ratio and opts to use that framework will be considered well-capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Regulatory agencies include in their evaluations of a banks capital adequacy, an assessment of the banks interest rate risk exposure. The standards for measuring the adequacy and effectiveness of a banking organizations interest rate risk management includes a measurement of board of directors and senior management oversight, and a determination of whether a banking organizations procedures for comprehensive risk management are appropriate to the circumstances of the specific banking organization. We utilize internal interest rate risk models to measure and monitor interest rate risk. Finally, regulatory agencies, as part of the scope of their periodic examinations, evaluate our interest rate risk. 
Commercial Real Estate Guidance 
 In December 2015, the federal banking agencies released a statement entitled Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending (the CRE Statement). In the CRE Statement, the agencies express concerns with institutions that ease commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that they will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. The agencies previously issued guidance in December 2006, entitled Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices, which states that an institution is potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk, and should employ enhanced risk management practices, where total commercial real estate loans represents 300% or more of its total capital and the outstanding balance of such institutions commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months. 
Deposit Insurance 
 The Banks deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Deposit insurance per account owner is $250,000. 
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDICs risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. That system, effective July 1, 2016, replaced the previous system under which institutions were placed in risk categories. 
 Federal law required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institutions total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for insured institutions of less than $10 billion in total assets to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points, effective July 1, 2016. 
 Federal legislation raised the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC was required to seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. The law required insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more to fund the increase from 1.15% to 1.35% and, effective July 1, 2016, such institutions were subject to a surcharge to achieve that goal. The FDIC indicated that the 1.35% ratio was exceeded in November 2018. Insured institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are receiving credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to increasing the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The FDIC has established a long-range target fund ratio of 2%.

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 
 Under the CRA, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income areas. CRA is designed to create a system for bank regulatory agencies to evaluate a depository institutions record in meeting the credit needs of its community. CRA regulations were completely revised as of July 1, 1995, to establish performance-based standards for use in examining for compliance. Assessment by bank regulators of CRA compliance focuses on three tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institutions record of making loans, including community development loans, in its designated assessment areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institutions record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and areas and small businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institutions delivery of banking services throughout its CRA assessment area, including low and moderate income areas. The Bank had its last completed CRA compliance examination conducted November 4, 2019 and received a satisfactory rating. 
Bank Secrecy Act, USA Patriot Act of 2001 (Patriot Act), and Related Rules and Regulations 
 The Patriot Act contained anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Among other requirements, the Patriot Act and the related regulations imposed the following requirements with respect to financial institutions: 

 | Establishment of anti-money laundering programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with the Patriot Acts requirements could have serious legal, financial, regulatory and reputational consequences. In addition, bank regulators will consider a holding companys effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on BHCA and Bank Merger Act applications. 
 In May 2018, a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network rule requiring banks to implement strengthened customer due diligence requirements took effect. Among other requirements, the rules contain explicit customer due diligence requirements and require banks to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. 
 Consumer Lending Laws 
 Bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on consumer protection laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations include: 
 

 | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
10 


 
 | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Lending laws;
--+-------------------


 | Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices laws and regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Truth in Savings Act.
--+----------------------

 The operations of the Bank are further subject to the: 
 

 | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institutions privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Holding Company Capital Regulations 
 Federal law required the Federal Reserve Board to apply consolidated capital requirements to bank holding companies that are no less stringent than those applicable to the institutions themselves. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions applied to bank holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer for bank holding companies was phased in between 2016 and 2019. However, legislation enacted in May 2018 required the FRB to raise the threshold of its small holding company exception to the applicability of consolidated holding company capital requirements from $1 billion of consolidated assets to $3 billion of consolidated assets. That change became effective in August 2018. Consequently, holding companies with less than $3 billion of consolidated assets, including the Company, are generally not subject to the requirements unless otherwise advised by the FRB. 
Dividends and Stock Repurchases 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the companys net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend. The guidance also provides for prior regulatory review where the companys overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the companys capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory review prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding as of the end of a quarter compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

 Federal Reserve System 
 FRB regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and demand deposit accounts). As of the reporting date, a reserve of 3% is to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between $16.3 million and $124.2 million (subject to adjustment annually by the FRB) plus a reserve of 10% (subject to adjustment by the FRB between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $124.2 million. The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment by the FRB) is exempt from the reserve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements. 
 Required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash, an account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks pay interest on depository institution required and excess reserve balances. 
 Future Legislation 
 Proposed legislation is introduced in almost every legislative session that would dramatically affect the regulation of the banking industry. We cannot predict if any such legislation will be adopted nor if adopted how it would affect our business. History has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations usually results in greater compliance burden and therefore generally increases the cost of doing business. 
Employees
