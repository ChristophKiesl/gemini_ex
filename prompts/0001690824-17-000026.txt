Item 1. Business.
 
Photozou Holdings, Inc. (fka Exquisite Acquisition, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 29, 2014. The Company selected November 30th as its fiscal year end. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing pursuant to a business combination. The business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition of or merger with, an existing company. We have had preliminary discussions with Photozou Co. Ltd, our sole shareholder pursuant to a business combination. Photozou Co., Ltd is domiciled in Japan and controlled by our sole director, Mr. Koichi Ishizuka.
 
The Company, based on proposed business activities, is a “blank check” company and subject to Rule 419 of Regulation C as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act." On August 19, 2016, the SEC deemed effective the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1.
 
The SEC defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.
