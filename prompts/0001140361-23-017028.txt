Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on January 19, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Initial Business Combination”). The Company has not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from January 19, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) described below, and since the Initial Public Offering to its search for an Initial Business Combination. We are also an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.
 
    Our sponsor is Ross Holding Company LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company that is affiliated with certain of the Company’s officers and directors (our “Sponsor”). On January 22, 2021, our Sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to cover certain expenses on our behalf in consideration of 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 (the “Founder Shares”). In connection with the Initial Public Offering, our Sponsor granted to each of our independent directors a four-year option that is immediately exercisable to purchase 15,000 Founder Shares at a price of $10.00 per share.
 
On March 16, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering consisting of 34,500,000 units (the “Units”), including 4,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $345.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $19.9 million, of which approximately $12.1 million was for deferred underwriting commissions. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares,” and with respect to the Class A Ordinary Shares underlying the Units, the “Public Shares”) and one-third of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”), with each whole Public Warrant exercisable for one Class A Ordinary Share at an initial exercise price of $11.50 per share.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 5,933,333 Private Placement Warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants,” and together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, with our Sponsor, with each Private Placement Warrant exercisable for one Class A Ordinary Share at an initial exercise price of $11.50 per share, generating gross proceeds of $8.9 million.
 
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $345.0 million ($10.00 per unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a Trust Account (“Trust Account”), located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, or held as cash, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an Initial Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.
 



Proposed Business Combination
 
Business Combination Agreement
 
    On January 17, 2023, the Company, entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), with APRINOIA Therapeutics Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“APRINOIA”), APRINOIA Therapeutics Holdings Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“PubCo”), APRINOIA Therapeutics Merger Sub 1, Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo (“Merger Sub 1” and together with PubCo, the “APRINOIA Acquisition Entities”), APRINOIA Therapeutics Merger Sub 2, Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub 2”) and APRINOIA Therapeutics Merger Sub 3, Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub 3”, together with Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, the “Merger Subs”, and Merger Sub 2 and Merger Sub 3, collectively, the “SPAC Acquisition Entities”), pursuant to which, subject to its terms and conditions, the Business Combination Agreement provides that (i) on the business day prior to the date of the Closing, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub 1, with Merger Sub 1 being the surviving entity (the “Initial Merger”), (ii) on the date of the Closing, Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into APRINOIA, with APRINOIA being the surviving entity (the “Second Merger”) and (iii) on the date of the Closing and immediately following the Second Merger, APRINOIA will merge with and into Merger Sub 3, with Merger Sub 3 being the surviving entity (the “Third Merger” and together with the Initial Merger and the Second Merger, the “Mergers”). As a result of the Mergers, the Company’s successor, Merger Sub 1 will continue to be a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo and Merger Sub 3 will be a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Merger Sub 1, and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo (as a whole, the “Proposed Business Combination”).
 
Transaction Consideration
 
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, on the business day prior to the Initial Merger: (i) the Sponsor shall automatically surrender for no consideration 3,018,750 issued and outstanding Founder Shares to the Company and such Founder Shares shall be deemed cancelled and no longer outstanding on the books of the Company and (ii) immediately following such surrender, each remaining issued and outstanding Founder Share will convert, on a one-for-one basis, into Class A Ordinary Shares.
 
Subject to, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, at the effective time of the Initial Merger: (i) (a) each of our Units, each consisting of one Class A Ordinary Share and one-third of one Public Warrant, each whole Public Warrant exercisable for one Class A Ordinary Share, will (to the extent not already separated) be automatically severed and the holder thereof will be deemed to hold one Class A Ordinary Share and one-third of one Public Warrant; then, immediately thereafter, (b) each of the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares of the Company will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, of PubCo (the “PubCo Ordinary Shares”); and (c) each of the Warrants of the Company will be assumed by PubCo and converted into a warrant to purchase one PubCo Ordinary Share at the same exercise price of $11.50 per share as the Warrants of the Company immediately prior to the Initial Merger, (ii) the issued and outstanding share in the capital of Merger Sub 1 will continue existing and constitute the only issued and outstanding share in the capital of Merger Sub 1, and (iii) the issued and outstanding share in the capital of PubCo shall be surrendered by the holder thereof to PubCo for no consideration and be cancelled by PubCo.
 
Subject to, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, on the date of the Closing and prior to the Second Merger, each Convertible Note (as defined below) will convert into ordinary shares of APRINOIA pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof.
 
Subject to, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, at the effective time of the Second Merger, (i) each then issued and outstanding ordinary share of APRINOIA, including the shares issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, and each then issued and outstanding preferred share (on an as-converted basis) of APRINOIA (other than any shares that are held by APRINOIA shareholders who have complied with the requirements of Cayman Islands law to exercise dissenter’s rights (the “APRINOIA Dissenting Shares”), collectively the “APRINOIA Shares”), will automatically be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive such number of newly issued PubCo Ordinary Shares that is equal to the APRINOIA Exchange Ratio, subject to rounding; (ii) each APRINOIA Dissenting Share shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable payments as set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, being the fair value for such APRINOIA Dissenting Share and such other rights as such holder may be entitled under the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands; (iii) the issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub 2 shall automatically be converted into one ordinary share of APRINOIA, which ordinary share shall constitute the only issued and outstanding share in the capital of APRINOIA; and (iv) each option to purchase APRINOIA ordinary shares (the “APRINOIA Options”) will be converted into the right to receive an option, granted in substitution of each such APRINOIA Option under an incentive equity plan to be adopted by PubCo prior to the Closing, to purchase PubCo Ordinary Shares (each a “PubCo Substitute Option”) upon substantially the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such APRINOIA Option immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Merger, except that (a) such PubCo Substitute Option shall provide the right to purchase that whole number of PubCo Ordinary Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of APRINOIA ordinary shares subject to such APRINOIA Option, multiplied by the APRINOIA Exchange Ratio, and (b) the exercise price per share for each such PubCo Substitute Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of such APRINOIA Option in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Merger, divided by the APRINOIA Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the nearest full cent), subject to customary exceptions and adjustments. The “APRINOIA Exchange Ratio” is a number determined by dividing 28,000,000 PubCo Ordinary Shares by the sum (without duplication) of: (a) the aggregate number of APRINOIA shares outstanding (on an as-converted basis) as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Merger (excluding APRINOIA shares issuable or issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes) and (b) the aggregate number of APRINOIA shares underlying APRINOIA Options (assuming, for purposes of this calculation, that all such APRINOIA Options are unexpired, issued, outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Merger, and are exercised on a fully paid basis).
 



Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, at the effective time of the Third Merger, (i) the issued and outstanding ordinary share of APRINOIA shall be cancelled and cease to exist by virtue of the Third Merger, and (ii) the issued and outstanding share in the capital of Merger Sub 3 shall continue existing and constitute the only issued and outstanding share in the capital of Merger Sub 3.
 
The parties to the Business Combination Agreement have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Business Combination Agreement, including, among others, covenants with respect to the conduct of APRINOIA, the APRINOIA Acquisition Entities, the Company and the SPAC Acquisition Entities. The Closing is subject to certain customary conditions.
  
Convertible Notes
 
 APRINOIA and certain investors (the “Convertible Note Holders”) have entered, or will enter into those certain convertible note purchase agreements (the “Convertible Note Purchase Agreements”) and other related ancillaries, pursuant to which such Convertible Note Holders have or will provide to APRINOIA debt financing in the aggregate amount of up to $35,000,000 to meet APRINOIA’s working capital requirements through the Closing (collectively, the “Convertible Notes”). The notes bear interest on the aggregate outstanding principal amount at a simple interest rate of 5% per annum. All unpaid principal and interest shall be due and payable in full on the first anniversary of the date of the applicable Convertible Note, unless accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default as set forth in the Convertible Notes. Each Convertible Notes may be redeemed upon the mutual agreement of the Convertible Note Holder and APRINOIA, at any time, as a whole or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the amount so redeemed, plus unpaid accrued interest thereon through the date of redemption, subject to the Convertible Note Holder’s exercise of its right of conversion at the then applicable Conversion Price (as defined below) in lieu of redemption. In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, APRINOIA received an aggregate of $12.5 million in exchange for Convertible Notes.
 
An affiliate of the Company and the Sponsor, R Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“R Investments”) entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement on December 22, 2022 to purchase a Convertible Note with an aggregate principal amount of $7,500,000 (the “R Investments Note”). In accordance with this Convertible Note Purchase Agreement, R Investments funded the R Investments Note and APRINOIA delivered the R Investments Note to R Investments simultaneously with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement. The R Investment Note is convertible at the option of R Investments in the event of (i) an initial public offering of APRINOIA ordinary shares (a “Qualified IPO”), (ii) a financing in which APRINOIA issues equity securities with total proceeds to APRINOIA of not less than $15,000,000 (a “Qualified Financing”), (iii) a Qualified Business Combination (as defined in the R Investment Note), (iv) the Proposed Business Combination and (v) if APRINOIA elects to redeem the R Investments Note. “Conversion Price” for the R Investments Note means (i) in the case of a Qualified IPO, a price equal to the per share public offering price stated on the front cover of the final prospectus for the Qualified IPO (before deduction of any underwriting commissions, expenses or other amounts) multiplied by 0.80, (ii) in the case of a Qualified Financing, a price equal to the cash price paid per share for equity securities by the investors in the Qualified Financing multiplied by 0.80, (iii) in the case of a Qualified Business Combination or the Proposed Business Combination, a price equal to the implied per share price of the ordinary shares of APRINOIA in such Qualified Business Combination or the Business Combination, as applicable, multiplied by 0.80, and (iv) in the event that the conversion is made pursuant to a redemption, $1.58. R Investments has consent rights over (i) indebtedness, other than the other Convertible Notes, that would rank senior or pari passu in right of payment to or with the R Investments Note. On January 13, 2023, R Investments agreed to convert the R Investments Note in connection with the consummation of the Proposed Business Combination.
 



 All other Convertible Notes convert automatically in the event of (i) a Qualified IPO, (ii) a Qualified Financing, and (iii) a Qualified Business Combination (as defined in the other Convertible Notes). Such other Convertible Notes are also convertible at the option of the Convertible Note Holder, if APRINOIA elects to redeem the Convertible Notes. “Conversion Price” for the other Convertible Notes means (i) in the case of a Qualified IPO, a price equal to the per share public offering price stated on the front cover of the final prospectus for the Qualified IPO (before deduction of any underwriting commissions, expenses or other amounts) multiplied by 0.80, (ii) in the case of a Qualified Financing, a price equal to the cash price paid per share for equity securities by the investors in the Qualified Financing multiplied by 0.80, (iii) in the case of a Qualified Business Combination, a price equal to the implied per share price of the ordinary shares of APRINOIA in such Qualified Business Combination multiplied by 0.80, and (iv) in the event that the conversion is made pursuant to a redemption, $1.58.
 
 Sponsor Support Agreement

 
Simultaneously with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, APRINOIA, PubCo and the Sponsor, entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”) pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to support the Business Combination and to vote all of its Founder Shares and any other securities of the Company beneficially owned or acquired by the Sponsor in favor of the Business Combination Agreement and the Proposed Business Combination. The Sponsor also agreed to take certain other actions in support of the Business Combination Agreement and the Proposed Business Combination and to refrain from taking such actions that would adversely impede the ability of the parties to perform the Business Combination Agreement. The Sponsor Support Agreement also prevents transfers of Company securities held by the Sponsor between the date of the Sponsor Support Agreement and the date of the Closing or earlier termination of the Business Combination Agreement unless the transferee executes a joinder to the Sponsor Support Agreement.
 
The Sponsor further agreed that 2,156,250 PubCo Ordinary Shares (the “Sponsor Earn-Out Shares”) to be received by it will be subjected to forfeiture at the Closing and will be earned, released and delivered upon satisfaction of the following milestones: (i) one half (1/2) of the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares will vest if, during the Earn-Out Period (as defined below), the VWAP (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement) of the PubCo Ordinary Shares is equal to or greater than $12.50 for any 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days and (ii) one half (1/2) of the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares will vest if, during the Earn-Out Period, the VWAP of the PubCo Ordinary Shares is equal to or greater than $15.00 for any 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days. If a PubCo Change of Control (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement) occurs during the Earn-Out Period, then immediately prior to the consummation of such PubCo Change of Control (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement), any Sponsor Earn-Out Shares not previously released shall be automatically released and no longer subject to forfeiture. “Earn-Out Period” means the period beginning on the date of Closing and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing (unless earlier terminated due to a PubCo Change of Control). Prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out Period, the Sponsor shall be entitled to vote and receive dividends on the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares until such Sponsor Earn-Out Shares are forfeited.
 
In addition, PubCo agreed to indemnify the Sponsor from and against certain liabilities relating to the Proposed Business Combination for a period of six years after the Closing.
 
 Shareholder Support Deed
 
 Simultaneously with and following the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, APRINOIA, PubCo and certain shareholders of APRINOIA entitled to vote on and/or give consent to certain matters to be approved by the shareholders of APRINOIA in connection with the Proposed Business Combination entered into a Shareholder Support Deed, pursuant to which, among other things, each such shareholder agreed (i) to vote in favor of such matters, (ii) to vote against any proposals that would impede the Proposed Business Combination, and (iii) not to transfer any APRINOIA shares held by such shareholder.
Investor Rights Agreement

 
Simultaneously with the Closing, PubCo, Sponsor, certain affiliates of Sponsor, the Company, and certain shareholders of APRINIOA shall have entered into an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) PubCo will agree to register for resale, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, within certain period after the Closing Date, certain PubCo Ordinary Shares and other equity securities of PubCo held by certain parties from time to time, (ii) holders of registrable securities will be granted certain takedown, demand, block trade and piggyback registration rights with respect to their registrable securities, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement, (iii) the holders of certain registrable securities will be subject to a six month lock-up, subject to certain exceptions and (iv) the Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated as of March 16, 2021, by and between RAC, Sponsor and certain other parties thereto, will be terminated as of the Closing.
Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement
 
 In connection with the Closing, PubCo, RAC and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, a New York limited purpose trust company, as warrant agent (the “Warrant Agent”) will enter into the Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement (the “Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement”), which will amend that certain Warrant Agreement (the “Existing Warrant Agreement”), dated as of March 16, 2021, by and between the Company and the Warrant Agent, which Existing Warrant Agreement governs all of the Warrants issued by the Company. Pursuant to the Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement, effective on and from the effective time of the Initial Merger, the Company will assign to PubCo all of the Company’s right, title and interest in and to the Existing Warrant Agreement and PubCo will assume, and agree to pay, perform, satisfy and discharge in full, as the same become due, all of the Company’s liabilities and obligations under the Existing Warrant Agreement, as amended, arising on, from and after the effective time of the Initial Merger.
 
 Lock-Up Agreements
 
 No later than immediately prior to the effective time of the Initial Merger, PubCo and certain APRINOIA shareholders will have entered into a lock-up agreement (“Lock-Up Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) each such APRINOIA shareholder agrees not to sell, for the period specified in the Lock-Up Agreement, certain PubCo Ordinary Shares such APRINOIA shareholder (as applicable) will receive in the Mergers, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Lock-Up Agreement.

 
Equity Commitment Letter

 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, R Investments (the “Forward Purchaser”), PubCo and APRINOIA entered into an equity commitment letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) pursuant to which the Forward Purchaser agreed to subscribe for, directly through PubCo and as a PIPE Investment (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), that number of PubCo Ordinary Shares at $10 per share equal to the difference between the actual value of the Trust Account (after giving effect to redemptions of Public Shares) and $12,500,000 (the “Maximum Commitment”), only to the extent that the value of the Trust Account (after giving effect to redemptions of Public Shares) is less than the Maximum Commitment. Any PubCo Ordinary Shares purchased by the Forward Purchaser pursuant to this Equity Commitment Letter shall be “Registrable Securities” under the Investor Rights Agreement upon the execution of the Investor Rights Agreement by the Forward Purchaser.
Extension and Redemptions
 
   On March 13, 2023, we held an extraordinary general meeting (the “Extension Meeting”). At the Extension Meeting, our shareholders approved as a special resolution, the amendment of the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which we must complete an Initial Business Combination by up to six months in one month increments subject to deposit of $165,000 into the Trust Account for each month by which such date is extended (the “Extension”). On March 13, 2023, following the shareholder approval, the Company filed the amendment to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. In connection with the Extension Meeting, shareholders holding 28,119,098 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in our Trust Account as of March 9, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $287.7 million (approximately $10.23 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. On March 31, 2023, APRINOIA made a deposit of $165,000 (the “First Extension Payment”) to the Trust Account. The date by which we must complete an Initial Business Combination was extended from March 16, 2023 to April 16, 2023. Following the aforementioned redemptions, we have 15,005,902 ordinary shares outstanding, which includes 6,380,902 Class A Ordinary Shares and 8,625,000 Founder Shares.
 
    After giving effect to the aforementioned redemptions and the First Extension Payment the amount of funds remaining in the Trust Account was approximately $65,458,680.62 as of March 31, 2023.
 



 Business Strategy


    Our business strategy is to identify, acquire, and after our Initial Business Combination, build a company in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of our management team and will benefit from our operational and investment expertise. Our acquisition selection process for the Proposed Business Combination with APRINOIA leveraged, and if we do not complete the Proposed Business Combination and instead seek to complete another Initial Business Combination will leverage, our team’s network of industry, private equity sponsor and lending community relationships as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, founders and entrepreneurs, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants that we believe provided us, and if necessary, would in the future provide us, with a number of business combination opportunities. This broad network of relationships has been developed and cultivated over decades of success as demonstrated by our management team’s:

• | track record of creating and growing successful companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | combined history of over 70 years in the private equity, M&A/restructuring advisory and corporate development;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experience in identifying, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to strengthen and advise management teams as they transition from private to public markets; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experience in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to our management team’s robust network, target business candidates have in the past, and may continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated contacts, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. If we do not complete the Proposed Business Combination and instead seek to complete another Initial Business Combination, members of our management team will again communicate with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and again begin the process of pursuing and reviewing promising leads.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience. We conducted such a review process in connection with the Proposed Business Combination.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) that our Initial Business Combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view. We did not need to, and did not obtain, such an opinion in connection with the Proposed Business Combination.
 
Each of our directors and officers own, directly or indirectly, Founder Shares and/or Private Placement Warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our Initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity or entities pursuant to which such officer or director is required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity or entities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, as amended (our “Charter”) provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.
 



Our officers or directors have had prior experience in blank check companies or special purpose acquisition corporations including WL Ross Holding Corp. and NBNK Investments PLC. Our founders, Sponsor, officers and directors may also sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an Initial Business Combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination. In addition, our founders, Sponsor, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
So long as our securities are then listed on the NYSE, our Initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement, including the Business Combination Agreement, in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Our board of directors determined that the Proposed Business Combination with APRINOIA satisfied this requirement. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. No such opinion was obtained in connection with the Proposed Business Combination. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 
    We have structured the Proposed Business Combination so that the post-business combination company in which our Public Shareholders will own shares will indirectly own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of APRINOIA. If we do not complete the Proposed Business Combination and search for an alternate Initial Business Combination, we anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-business combination company in which our Public Shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure any Initial Business Combination other than the Proposed Business Combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an Initial Business Combination without the prior consent of our Sponsor. Our Sponsor consented to the Proposed Business Combination. If our securities are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test. For additional information on the Proposed Business Combination, you are urged to read our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 18, 2023 and the registration statement on Form F-4 to be filed by PubCo in connection with the Proposed Business Combination when it becomes available, the amendments thereto, as well as other documents filed with the SEC in connection with the Proposed Business Combination.
 



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate the Proposed Business Combination, and any other Initial Business Combination, using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources.
 
We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. Although our management endeavored to evaluate the risks inherent in APRINOIA’s business, and will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any other particular target business, we cannot assure you that we have, or will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity, as will be the case for the Proposed Business Combination, or debt, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Public Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
APRINOIA has entered into Convertible Note Purchase Agreements and Convertible Notes to raise additional funds through private offerings in connection with the Proposed Business Combination, and we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of any other Initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we have targeted, and may in the future, target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by Public Shareholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete the Proposed Business Combination, or such other Initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we expect to complete any other financing simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In the case of an Initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, such as the Proposed Business Combination, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the Initial Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with the Proposed Business Combination or any other Initial Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. Other than pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter and the R Investments Convertible Note, none of our Sponsor, officers, directors or shareholders are required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our Initial Business Combination.
 



Sources of Target Businesses
 
As discussed elsewhere in this annual report, we intend to complete the Proposed Business Combination with APRINOIA. However, if we do not complete the Proposed Business Combination and instead seek another Initial Business Combination, target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read our filings with the SEC and know what types of businesses we are targeting. If we do not complete the Proposed Business Combination and instead seek another Initial Business Combination, our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, if we do not complete the Proposed Business Combination and instead seek another Initial Business Combination, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. No finder was engaged, and no finder fee will be paid, in connection with the Proposed Business Combination. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or their respective affiliates be paid by us any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of any other Initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
 
Commencing March 16, 2021, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Business Combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our Initial Business Combination. No such arrangements were entered in connection with the Proposed Business Combination; however, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., is expected to serve as a director of PubCo following the Proposed Business Combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements was not used as a criterion in our selection process for APRINOIA, and will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of any other acquisition candidate.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such Initial Business Combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. The Proposed Business Combination is not a transaction with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, or any of our founders, officers or directors.
 
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an Initial Business Combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.
 



Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of the Proposed Business Combination
 
In evaluating APRINOIA, we conducted a due diligence review of APRINOIA, which included: (i) extensive meetings with APRINOIA’s management teams and representatives regarding APRINOIA’s operations, major customers, financial prospects and other customary due diligence matters; (ii) legal and commercial review of APRINOIA’s material business contracts, books and records, government regulations and filings, intellectual property and information technology; (iii) financial due diligence and analysis of APRINOIA with the assistance of its financial advisors; and (iv) research on the industry in which APRINOIA operates. In evaluating any other prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
 
We have expended considerable time, and incurred considerable costs, to select and evaluate APRINOIA and to structure and pursue completion of the Proposed Business Combination. The time required to select and evaluate any other target business and to structure and complete any other Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The Company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our Initial Business Combination.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of the Proposed Business Combination or any other Initial Business Combination, the prospects for our success will likely depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
  Although we closely scrutinized the management of APRINOIA when evaluating the desirability of effecting the Proposed Business Combination, and would closely scrutinize the management of any other prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting any other Initial Business Combination, our assessment of the APRINOIA’s management, or such other target business’ management, may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Initial Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure investors that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
  We cannot assure investors that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with PubCo or any other combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with PubCo or any other combined company will be made at the time of the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination.
 
  Following the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure investors that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 



Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve the Initial Business Combination
 
Although we do not intend to do so in connection with the Proposed Business Combination, we may conduct redemptions for any other Initial Business Combination without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our Charter. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
 
Under the NYSE’s listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for any Initial Business Combination if, for example:
 

• | We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number or voting power of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 1% or more (or 5% or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of any Initial Business Combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
 

• | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the Company; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the Initial Business Combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other time and budget constraints of the Company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | additional legal complexities of an Initial Business Combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. For illustrative purposes, as of March 31, 2023, the amount in the Trust Account was approximately $10.26 per Public Share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering, if any. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its Public Shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination with respect to our Warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our Public Shares, even if a Public Shareholder has properly elected to redeem its Public Shares, if the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination does not close. Our Sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our Initial Business Combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our Charter (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide Public Shareholders the right to have their Public Shares redeemed in connection with our Initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination by September 16, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of Public Shareholders or pre-Initial Business Combination activity.
Limitations on Redemptions
 
Our Charter provides that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Although the Proposed Business Combination does not, any other Initial Business Combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of such Initial Business Combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Public Shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of such Initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete such Initial Business Combination or redeem any Public Shares, and all Public Shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination, as we intend to do in connection with the Proposed Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of any Initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive, such as the Proposed Business Combination, and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our Charter would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE rules. Our Public Shareholders will have the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the Proposed Business Combination in connection with a shareholder meeting to be called to approve the Proposed Business Combination.
 
If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our Initial Business Combination, as we intend to do in connection with the Proposed Business Combination, we will, pursuant to our Charter:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, as we intend to do in connection with the Proposed Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our Public Shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, as we intend to do in connection with the Proposed Business Combination, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a shareholder meeting are voted in favor of the Initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed pursuant to the letter agreement, and, in the case of the Proposed Business Combination, the Sponsor Support Agreement, to vote their Founder Shares and Public Shares in favor of our Initial Business Combination. Following the redemptions of Public Shares in connection with implementation of the Extension Amendment, only 6,380,902 Public Shares remain outstanding. As a result, we will not need any of the remaining Public Shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an Initial Business Combination in order to have our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Business Combination, approved. However, the structure of the Proposed Business Combination contemplates that as a result of the Initial Merger, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub 1, with Merger Sub 1 surviving. Approval of the Initial Merger requires a special resolution, being the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a shareholder meeting of the Company. As a result, in addition to the Founder Shares, we would need 1,378,935, or 21.6% (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted), of the remaining 6,380,902 Public Shares to be voted in favor of the Initial Merger in order to proceed with the Proposed Business Combination. If only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted, we will not need any of the remaining Public Shares to be voted in favor of the Initial Merger in order to proceed with the Proposed Business Combination.
 



Each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination or vote at all. In addition, our Sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of any Initial Business Combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our Charter (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide Public Shareholders the right to have their Public Shares redeemed in connection with our Initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination by September 16, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of our Public Shareholders or pre-Initial Business Combination activity.
 
If, for an Initial Business Combination other than the Proposed Business Combination, we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our Charter:
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of such an Initial Business Combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A Ordinary Shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least twenty business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on Public Shareholders not tendering more than the number of Public Shares we are permitted to redeem. If Public Shareholders tender more Public Shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such Initial Business Combination.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, as we plan to do for the Proposed Business Combination, and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Charter provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the remaining shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Business Combination, as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a Public Shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the remaining shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the remaining shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an Initial Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination.
Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities
 
If we seek shareholder approval of any Initial Business Combination, as we plan to do in connection with the Proposed Business Combination, and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination, although they are under no obligation or duty to do so.
 
Any such price per share may be different than the amount per share a Public Shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its Public Shares in connection with the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgment that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase Public Shares in privately negotiated transactions from Public Shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their Public Shares. It is intended that, if Rule 10b-18 would apply to purchases by the Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates, then such purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, to the extent it applies, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases.
 
Additionally, at any time at or prior to the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire Public Shares, vote their Public Shares in favor of the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination or not redeem their Public Shares. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in such transactions prior to completion of the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
 
  The purpose of any such transactions could be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination, (2) reduce the number of Public Warrants outstanding and/or increase the likelihood of approval on any matters submitted to the Public Warrant holders for approval or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
  In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our securities may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
  Our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Public Shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against the Proposed Business Combination or any other Initial Business Combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 



  Our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. Additionally, in the event our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates were to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants from Public Shareholders, such purchases would be structured in compliance with the requirements of Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act including, in pertinent part, through adherence to the following:
 

• | our registration statement/proxy statement filed for the Proposed Business Combination or any other Initial Business Combination would disclose the possibility that our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants from Public Shareholders outside the redemption process, along with the purpose of such purchases; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates were to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants from Public Shareholders, they would do so at a price no higher than the price offered through our redemption process; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our registration statement/proxy statement filed for the Proposed Business Combination or any other Initial Business Combination would include a representation that any of our securities purchased by our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates would not be voted in favor of approving the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates would not possess any redemption rights with respect to our securities or, if they do acquire and possess redemption rights, they would waive such rights; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we would disclose in a Form 8-K, before our security holder meeting to approve the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination, the following material items:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the amount of our securities purchased outside of the redemption offer by our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates, along with the purchase price;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the purpose of the purchases by our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the impact, if any, of the purchases by our s Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates and their affiliates on the likelihood that the Proposed Business Combination or other Initial Business Combination will be approved; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the identities of our security holders who sold to our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates (if not purchased on the open market) or the nature of our security holders (e.g., 5% security holders) who sold to our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the number of our securities for which we have received redemption requests pursuant to our redemption offer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Please see “Risk Factors — If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, as we intend to do in connection with the Proposed Business Combination, our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants from Public Shareholders, which may influence a vote on any Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Business Combination, and reduce the public “float” of our Class A Ordinary Shares or Public Warrants.”
 



Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
Public Shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the Proposed Business Combination or other Initial Business Combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our Public Shares in connection with Proposed Business Combination or other Initial Business Combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a Public Shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the Initial Business Combination if we distribute proxy materials, as we plan to do in connection with the Proposed Business Combination, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their Public Shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by some other blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, some other blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an Initial Business Combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the Proposed Business Combination or other Initial Business Combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a Public Share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our Public Shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of the Proposed Business Combination or any other Initial Business Combination.
 
If our Initial Business Combination, including the Proposed Business Combination, is not approved or completed for any reason, then our Public Shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by Public Shareholders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If the Proposed Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete another Initial Business Combination with a different target until September 16, 2023.
 



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
 
Our Charter provides that we have until September 16, 2023 to consummate an Initial Business Combination. If we have not consummated the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination by September 16, 2023, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination by September 16, 2023. Our Charter provides that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.
 
Our Sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares they hold if we fail to consummate the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination by September 16, 2023 (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if we fail to complete the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame).
 
Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our Charter (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide Public Shareholders the right to have their Public Shares redeemed in connection with the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination by September 16, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of Public Shareholders or pre- Initial Business Combination activity, unless we provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares. However, we may not redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of Public Shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our Public Shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer or director, or any other person.
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from a limited amount of funds held outside the Trust Account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the Trust Account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure investors that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our Public Shareholders. We cannot assure shareholders that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure shareholders that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 



Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our Public Shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters of the Initial Public Offering have not executed, and will not execute, an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.00 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business, such as APRINOIA, that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our Company. Therefore, we cannot assure shareholders that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.00 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure shareholders that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per Public Share.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. APRINOIA and PubCo executed such a waiver in connection with the Proposed Business Combination. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to a limited amount of funds following the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our Trust Account received by any such shareholder.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure shareholders we will be able to return $10.00 per Public Share to our Public Shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying Public Shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure shareholders that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 



Our Public Shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our Public Shares if we do not complete the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination by September 16, 2023, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our Charter (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide Public Shareholders the right to have their Public Shares redeemed in connection with the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination by September 16, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of Public Shareholders or pre- Initial Business Combination activity, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the Proposed Business Combination or such other Initial Business Combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our Charter, like all provisions of our Charter, may be amended with a shareholder vote.
 
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 1 Pelican Lane, Palm Beach, FL 33480. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee that we pay an affiliate of our Sponsor for office space, administrative and support services.
Employees
 
We currently have three officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed the Proposed Business Combination or another Initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our Company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting APRINOIA for the Proposed Business Combination we encountered, and if we need to identify, evaluate and select another target business for our Initial Business Combination, we expect to continue to encounter, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other special purpose acquisition companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries.
 
Some of these competitors may possess greater resources or more specialized industry knowledge related to a specific business combination target than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of some of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for business combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing business combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable may be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our Public Shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of any other Initial Business Combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for any other Initial Business Combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating any other Initial Business Combination.
 



Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following March 16, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
