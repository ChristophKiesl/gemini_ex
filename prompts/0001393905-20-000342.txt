GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN CHINA
 
We will be subject to applicable laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations including United States securities laws. We will be required to comply with all regulations, restrictions, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in China.
 
Under Paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Peoples Republic of China Corporate Income Tax Law (the Corporate Income Law), any foreign enterprise which shall constitute a resident enterprise shall meet both of the following requirements: (i) such enterprise was established under the laws of foreign countries or regions; and (ii) the actual management of such enterprise must be located within China. Further, under relevant provisions of the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding the Issues Relevant to the Identification of Chinese-controlled Enterprises Registered Abroad as Resident Enterprises by Actual Management (Guo Shui Fa [2009] No. 82, 

4


Circular No. 82) issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2009 and based upon our no-name inquiry to the Peoples Republic of China State Administration for Taxation, any Chinese-controlled enterprise whose actual management is held to be located within China shall satisfy all of the following requirements: (i) the site, where the management of such enterprise responsible for the daily operation of such enterprise performs its duties, is located within China; (ii) the financial decisions (such as borrowings, extending loans, financing or financial risks management) and HR policies (such as appointment, dismissal or remunerations) shall be made or approved by the institution or personnel of such enterprise staying within China; (iii) 1/2 or more of the directors with voting rights or of the management of such enterprise live within China permanently; and (iv) the main assets, accounting books and stamps of and the minutes and files of the board of directors of and of shareholders meeting of such enterprise exist and will be maintained within China.
 
We believe that we are not considered a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. We have no subsidiaries within China. We have executive offices in China, and all of our management is located within China. We make or approve the financial decisions (such as borrowing, extending loans, financing or financial risks management) and human resource policies (such as employees appointment, dismissal and remunerations) within China, and our sole director with voting rights are also located within China. However, our main assets, accounting books, stamps and minutes of our directors board and of our shareholders meetings exist and will be maintained in the USA but not within China, so we are not consistent with Item (iv) of the above four requirements under Circular No. 82 although our present conditions satisfy Items (i) to (iii) of the above requirements under Circular No. 82. Therefore, even if we are an enterprise established under the laws Nevada, and our management team is located within China, we believe that we shall not be held to be a resident enterprise under the Corporate Income Tax Law.
 
Nevertheless, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that there is a difference or discrepancy between the interpretation of the Chinese authorities and our understanding as set forth above, nor can we assure that the statements or interpretations of the Chinese government officials will remain unchanged. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Chinese government will promulgate any new laws, regulations or provisions that will be in conflict with our understanding. If so, we may be classified as a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.
 
If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations.
 
If we are considered a resident enterprise, this could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC enterprise shareholders from transferring our shares and a 20% withholding tax on dividends we pay to our non-PRC individual stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC individual stockholders from transferring our shares. If we are required under PRC law to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC investors or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our shares, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.
 
Government policies are subject to rapid change and the government of the China may adopt policies which have the effect of hindering private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance that the government of China will not significantly alter its policies from time to time without notice in a manner with reduces or eliminates any benefits from its present policies of economic reform. In addition, a substantial portion of productive assets in China remains government-owned. For instance, all lands are state owned and business entities or individuals are granted by government state-owned land use rights. The granting process is typically based on government policies at the time of granting, which could be lengthy and complex. This process may adversely affect our business. The government of China also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Uncertainties may arise with changing of governmental policies and measures. In addition, changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency, the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises, as well as adverse changes in the political, economic or social conditions in China, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China.
 
Our company will be a subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the Chinese jurisdictions in which we will provide our offerings. We could be a subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that we believe are invalid or inapplicable. It could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of potential customers. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be adopted.
 
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING STRATEGY
 
We plan to use Internet promotion as our main marketing strategy. In order to embrace larger audience and promote among subscribers and their followers on the social media by paying for the promotional posts and ordering content from freelance writers. We also may invest in YouTube and Weibo videos production, as well as posting banners on videos. We also plan to investing part of advertising budget in printing catalogues with tours description, prices, services description, actual photos from the tours we delivered and customers feedback. We plan to promote this printed catalogues via hospital, clinics and other specialised rooms, we intend to make agreements with them. We plan to promote our service on the top enquiries of Google, Baidu and Bing search engines. We expect this to be the result of improving our SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Additionally, we may edit videos filmed during the trips into video promos for the web sites, as well as other streaming video services. As our business relates to touristic services we intend to be listed on websites providing information for tourists, such as TripAdvisor.
REVENUE
 
We expect to receive revenues directly from customers, for the services they purchase. We also deliver guide service around the Chinese hospitals, clinics and medical rooms. We also intend to charge hospitals and clinics which wish to be placed onto a tour map both printed or interactive. If we make agreements with hospitals and clinics to bring our customers to those establishments for consulting services or treatment ones - we plan to receive a fee as determined by the agreement.
COMPETITIVE COMPARISON
 
We see narrowing down to a specific sort of tourism as our competitive advantage on the market of touristic services. This tourism doesnt require any physical skills, so it can attract a large audience.
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation.
