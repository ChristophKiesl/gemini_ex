Recent Developments
The risks and uncertainties regarding the future of our business due to the impact of COVID-19 and regulatory uncertainty, combined with our historical lack of profitability, have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.

From the acquisition of UMBRLA, the Company has established multiple cannabis-lifestyle brands. The Company is home to Korova, a brand of high potency products across multiple product categories, currently available in California, Oregon, Arizona, and Oklahoma. Other Company brands include Cabana, a boutique cannabis flower brand, and Sticks, a mainstream value-driven cannabis brand, available in California and Oregon. With the acquisition of People’s First Choice and the subsequent opening of People's Downtown LA store, the Company operates five cannabis dispensaries in California. In addition to People's First Choice, and People's Downtown LA, the Company also operates The Spot in Santa Ana, Blüm in Oakland and Silverstreak in San Leandro. The company operates two cultivation facilities in California. The Company also operates a non-storefront delivery service in Sacramento under the Silverstreak name.

markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.
To date, we have been able to continue our operations and do not anticipate any material interruptions in the foreseeable future. However, we are continuing to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our industry and our company.
Marijuana Industry Overview
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds.” The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ for other purposes such as hemp production and generally references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp.
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. indica (“Indica”), and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately four meters. The females produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”) and which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC.
As of December 2021, there are a total of 39 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have passed legislation as it relates to medicinal cannabis. Of these states, 19 (including the District of Columbia) have decriminalized adult cannabis use. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”). The CSA classifies cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse and has no currently-accepted use for medical treatment. 
These 39 states, and the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that allow certain patients who use medicinal cannabis and/or cannabis-derived products under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different. 
Cannabis decriminalization is generally referred to as the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession and use of cannabis by adults, including cultivation for personal use and casual, nonprofit transfers of small amounts. Legalization is generally referred to as the development of a legally controlled market for cannabis, where consumers purchase from a safe, legal, and regulated source.
Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in California, Oregon and Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable California, Oregon and laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
