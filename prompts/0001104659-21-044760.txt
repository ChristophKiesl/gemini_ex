ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an innovative drug delivery company engaged in the research, development and commercialization of technologies and products intended to address safe use of medications. We have discovered and developed three proprietary platform technologies which can be used to develop multiple products. Our Limitx™ Technology is being developed to minimize the risk of overdose, our Aversion® Technology is intended to address methods of abuse associated with opioid analgesics while our Impede® Technology is directed at minimizing the extraction and conversion of pseudoephedrine, or PSE, into methamphetamine. Oxaydo Tablets (oxycodone HCl, CII), which utilizes the Aversion Technology, is the first approved immediate-release oxycodone product in the United States with abuse deterrent labeling. Nexafed brand products utilize our Impede Technology.
 
Limitx, a development stage technology, is designed to retard the release of active drug ingredients when too many tablets are accidentally or purposefully ingested by neutralizing stomach acid with buffer ingredients but deliver efficacious amounts of drug when taken as a single tablet with a nominal buffer dose. We have completed four clinical studies of various product formulations utilizing the Limitx Technology which have demonstrated proof-of-concept for the Limitx Technology and will allow us to advance a product to development for a New Drug Application, or NDA. Studies AP-LTX-400, or Study 400, and Study AP-LTX-401, or Study 401, both utilizing our LTX-04 hydromorphone formulation demonstrated the mean maximum drug concentration in blood, or Cmax, was reduced in healthy adult fasted subjects by 50% to 65% when excessive buffer levels were ingested or a situation consistent with over-ingestion of tablets. Study AP-LTX-301, or Study 301 demonstrated drug Cmax from LTX-03, a Limitx hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen combination product, in healthy adult fasted subjects trended toward bioequivalence in test formulations A through E and showed an increasing reduction in Cmax for formulations F through H; in which formulations A though H had increasing incremental amounts of buffer starting with no buffer in formulation A. We believe the results of Study 301 demonstrated that LTX-03 is a formulation that optimizes the balance between effective blood levels of drug for pain relief at a single tablet dose while retarding bioavailability of drug when multiple tablets are ingested. The FDA designated the development program for LTX-04 as Fast Track, which is designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. However, we intend to advance LTX-03, which combines the hydrocodone micro-particles, acetaminophen and buffer ingredients into a single tablet, as our lead Limitx product candidate due to its larger market size and its known prevalence of oral excessive tablet abuse and overdose, and we voluntarily placed the Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for LTX-04 on inactive status. We submitted an IND for LTX-03 to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018 in order to advance to NDA development, which became effective in April 2018.
 
On June 28, 2019, we entered into License, Development and Commercialization Agreement, which was amended in October 2020, (“AD Pharma Agreement”) with Abuse Deterrent Pharma, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company (“AD Pharma”), a special purpose company representing a consortium of investors that will finance Acura’s operations through July 2021 and reimburse us for development of LTX-03. The AD Pharma Agreement grants AD Pharma exclusive commercialization rights in the United States to LTX-03 as well as to LTX-02 (oxycodone/acetaminophen) and LTX-09 (alprazolam). At March 31, 2021 AD Pharma is delinquent in remitting monthly license payments for December, 2020 thru March, 2021 and approximately $100,000 of reimbursable LTX-03 development expenses.
 
In January 2015, we and Egalet US, Inc. and Egalet Ltd., each a subsidiary of Egalet Corporation (now known as Assertio Holdings Inc. and formerly known as Assertio Life Sciences), or collectively Assertio, entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Assertio Agreement”) pursuant to which we exclusively licensed to Assertio worldwide rights to manufacture and commercialize our Aversion Technology product Oxaydo. Oxaydo is currently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for marketing in the United States in 5mg and 7.5mg strengths. Assertio launched Oxaydo in the United States late in the third quarter of 2015. We are not actively developing product candidates utilizing our Aversion Technology.

We launched our first Impede Technology product, Nexafed, into the United States market in December 2012 and launched our Nexafed Sinus Pressure + Pain product in the United States in February 2015. On March 16, 2017, we and MainPointe Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or MainPointe, entered into a License, Commercialization and Option Agreement, or the MainPointe Agreement, pursuant to which we granted MainPointe an exclusive license to our Impede technology in the U.S. and Canada to commercialize our Nexafed products. The MainPointe Agreement also grants MainPointe the option to expand the licensed territory to the European Union, Japan and South Korea and to add additional pseudoephedrine-containing products utilizing our Impede technology. MainPointe is controlled by Mr. John Schutte, who became our largest shareholder pursuant to a private placement completed in July 2017. On January 1, 2020, MainPointe assigned to AD Pharma, an entity controlled by Mr. Schutte, with Acura’s consent, all of its right, title and interest in the Agreement between MainPointe and Acura.
 
We conduct research, development, laboratory, manufacturing, and warehousing activities at our operations facility in Culver, Indiana and lease an administrative office in Palatine, Illinois. In addition to internal capabilities and activities, we engage numerous clinical research organizations, or CROs, with expertise in regulatory affairs, clinical trial design and monitoring, clinical data management, biostatistics, medical writing, laboratory testing and related services. Our Supply Agreements with two third-party pharmaceutical product manufacturers and packagers to supply our commercial requirements for our Nexafed and Nexafed Sinus Pressure + Pain products were assigned to MainPointe in accordance with the MainPointe Agreement.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to focus on addressing the safe use of pharmaceuticals by developing a broad portfolio of technologies and products with enhanced safety features and benefits. Specifically, we intend to:

· | Capitalize on our experience and expertise in the research and development of innovative drug delivery technologies that address medication safety. We have one FDA approved product containing our Aversion Technology commercially launched in the United States by our licensee, and two products commercially launched containing our Impede Technology. We are currently devoting our efforts to product candidates utilizing our LIMITx Technology, which we believe will offer a significant measure of safety to those who would intentionally or otherwise ingest excessive number of tablets. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Leverage our technologies by developing a full line of pharmaceutical products which utilize our proprietary technologies. Medication abuse and misuse is not limited to single drugs but often pervades entire drug categories. We intend to develop or collaborate with strategically focused pharmaceutical companies to develop multiple products with our technologies, and are seeking licensing partners for products in development utilizing our LIMITx Technology. 
· | Commercialize our products by licensing to strategically focused companies in the United States and other geographic territories. We have licensed our Oxaydo product to Assertio for commercialization, have licensed our Aversion Technology to KemPharm for use in certain of its prodrug products, have licensed our Nexafed products utilizing our Impede Technology to MainPointe/AD Pharma for commercialization (and granted MainPointe and AD Pharma options to other Impede products), and we entered into an agreement with AD Pharma that will finance Acura’s operations, through July, 2021, provide for the completion of development of LTX-03 and grants them exclusive commercialization rights in the United States to LTX-03. Additionally, we are seeking other licensing partners for other product candidates utilizing our LIMITx, Aversion and Impede technologies. 
· | Maintain an efficient internal cost structure. Our internal cost structure is focused on discovering new technologies and developing product formulations using those technologies. We outsource many high cost elements of development and commercialization, such as clinical trials and commercial manufacturing that minimize required fixed overhead and capital investment and thereby reduces our business risk.

Misuse or Abuse of Prescription Opioid Products and Development of Risk Mitigation Formulations
 
In 2018, there were 312,000 incidents of self-harm in the US. In 2019, suicides exceeded 47,000 with half the US states reporting a greater than 30% increase since 1999. For ages 15-24, suicide is the second leading cause of death and veterans die by suicide at a higher rate than the civilian population. Only 54% of suicide decedents had a prior diagnosis of a mental health issue and over 10% had chronic pain representing potential opioid patients. Suicide by poisoning, which would include overdose of prescription medications, make up over 10% of successful suicide attempts with those with prior diagnosed mental health issues twice as likely to die by poisoning.
 
Overdose is not limited to intentional acts of self-harm. In 2018, over 67,000 citizens died from accidental licit and illicit drug overdose, with the most prevalent licit drug classes being opioids, psychostimulants, benzodiazepines and antidepressants. The misuse and abuse of opioid analgesics continues to constitute a dynamic and challenging threat to the United States and in 2017, the US Government declared opioid abuse as an epidemic and national health emergency. In 2018, an estimated 9.9 million persons aged 12 years and older, reported opioid misuse in the past year. Overdoses involving opioids killed nearly 47,000 people in 2018 and 32% of those deaths involved prescription opioids.
 
The CDC also identified rising overdose deaths resulting from “polysubstance” drug use. Polysubstance drug use occurs with exposure to more than one drug, with or without the person’s knowledge. This growing issue also means that an opioid-involved overdose often occurs in combination with exposure to other opioids and/or other non-opioid substances. Some examples of polysubstance exposures found in combination in overdose deaths include illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) and heroin; illicitly manufactured fentanyl and cocaine; heroin and methamphetamine; and prescription or illicit opioids and benzodiazepines. Recent data indicate that the involvement of opioids in stimulant-involved deaths is increasing. Nearly three-quarters (72.7%) of cocaine-involved overdose deaths also involved an opioid in 2017.  Although increases in psychostimulant-involved deaths have occurred Prescription opioids drugs, such as morphine and oxycodone, have a long history of use for the management of pain. Because they are highly effective, they are one of the largest prescribed drug categories in the U.S. However, a side effect of high doses of opioids is euphoria, or “a high”. For these reasons, opioids are the most misused or abused prescription drugs in the U.S. Opioids are offered in a variety of dosages including immediate-release tablets (or capsules), extended-release tablets (or capsules), patches and other formats. Those who misuse or abuse drugs will often do so in one of the following manners:
 

· | Oral Excessive Tablet Abuse (ETA). Generally recognized as the most prevalent route of administration by abusers, the abuser simply orally ingests more tablets (or capsules) than is recommended for pain relief.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Oral Manipulated Tablet Abuse (MTA). Extended-release tablets or patches are sometimes crushed, chewed or otherwise physically or chemically manipulated to defeat the extended-release mechanism and provide an immediate-release of the opioid for oral ingestion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nasal snorting. Crushed tablets are insufflated for absorption of the drug through the nasal tissues.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Injection. The opioid is physically or chemically removed from the dosage and injected into the vein using a syringe.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Poly-substance. Opioids are sometimes used in conjunction with alcohol, methamphetamine, or other drugs to accentuate the high.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Overdose. Drug abusers may accidentally introduce excessive quantities of drugs in their systems or combine drugs that may heighten the chance of adverse effects of drugs. Some patients may over ingest drugs accidentally or with the express intent of suicide.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Safe use technology formulations incorporate physical and/or chemical barriers or functionality in the products to prevent or discourage a user from inappropriately administering the product. The extent and manner in which any of the features of these formulations may be described in the FDA approved label for our development products will be dependent on the results of and the acceptance by the FDA of our and our licensees’ studies for each product.

Development of safe use products typically require one or more studies. These studies may include in vitro laboratory studies (which may include but not be limited to: syringeability of the formulation, extractability of the active ingredient, and particle size of the crushed product), animal studies (which may include but not be limited to: respiratory depression), and human clinical studies (which may include but not be limited to: human abuse liability, respiratory depression studies) comparing the benefits of our product candidates to currently marketed products.
 
Because our products use known active ingredients in approved dosage strengths, the safety and efficacy of the active ingredient(s) will need to be established by a series of pharmacokinetic studies demonstrating: (a) bioequivalence to an approved reference drug, (b) food effect of our formulations, (c) dose proportionality of our formulation, and (d) other external impacts to our unique formulations. A product candidate that does not achieve satisfactory pharmacokinetic results may require a phase III clinical efficacy study.
 
Further development will likely also entail additional safety and/or efficacy assessment as may be identified by the FDA for each specific formulation during the Investigational New Drug application, or IND, or NDA phase of development. In accordance with the FDA’s 2015 Guidance, we will likely have a post-approval requirement for each of our opioid products, if approved, to perform an epidemiology study to assess the in-market impact on abuse of our formulation and most approved opioid products are subject to an FDA approved risk evaluation and mitigations strategy (REMS).
 
Overdose Risk Mitigation - Products and Development
 
Any drug may initiate severe unwanted side effects when overdosed. For example, a known and FDA labelled side effect of the overdose of opioids is respiratory depression. High doses of opioids can affect the respiratory center of the brain resulting in a slowing and/or shallowing of the breathing which increases carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood stream. Opioids also impact ancillary CO2 monitoring of the blood preventing the body from taking corrective action. The increased CO2 and resulting decrease in oxygen in the blood systematically shuts down body systems and may result in death.
 
Abusers as well as legitimate pain patients are at risk of overdose. In some cases, overdose is accidental but anecdotal reports indicate suicide rates among pain patients are increasing presumably due to their inability to access the pain medications they need to manage their condition.
 
In June 2019, FDA issued a draft for public comment guidance on a Benefit-Risk Assessment Framework for Opioid Analgesic Drugs. The draft guidance indicates FDA will “consider the public health risks of the [opioid] drug related to misuse, abuse, opioid use disorder, accidental exposure, and overdose in both patients and nonpatients, as well as any properties of the drug that may mitigate such risks”. We intend to develop our LIMITx Technology products consistent with this pending guidance and perform studies to demonstrate our drug candidates have properties to mitigate the risk of overdose. Further development of our LIMITx Technology products will likely also entail additional safety and/or efficacy assessment as may be identified by the FDA for each specific formulation during the Investigational New Drug application, or IND, or the NDA phase of development.
 
LIMITx™ Technology
 
LIMITx Technology is intended to address the accidental or intentional consumption of multiple tablets and provide a margin of safety against respiratory depression. We believe these benefits for opioids are consistent with FDA’s proposed direction to require all newly approved opioid products to have features of benefits that provide safety or efficacy benefits over existing available opioid therapies.

LIMITx Technology Products in Development
 
We have the following products in development utilizing our LIMITx Technology:
 

LIMITx Technology Products | Status 
---------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immediate-release hydrocodone bitartrate with acetaminophen (LTX-03) | FDA registration/clinical batches complete in Feb. 2021 – quality assurance testing is pending. IND updated Feb. 2021 with protocols for 3 human clinical studies. 
Immediate-release oxycodone HCl (LTX-01) & (LTX-02) | Formulation development in process 
Immediate-release non-opioid drug (LTX-09) | Formulation development in process 
Immediate-release hydromorphone HCI (LTX-04) | Two Phase I exploratory pharmacokinetic studies completed. IND no longer active. 

LTX-03 Development
 
Study 301
 
Study 301 was an open-label, parallel design pharmacokinetic study testing our LIMITx formulation LTX-03 in 72 fasted healthy adult subjects randomized into 9 groups (8 subjects per group). One group swallowed a single Norco® 10/325mg tablet, the marketed comparator or reference drug. The remaining 8 groups swallowed a single LTX-03 tablet with increasing buffering amounts starting with no buffer, LTX-03 formulations A through H, respectively. All 72 subjects completed the study and the doses were generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events. One subject in the Formulation E group was not analyzed due to emesis. LTX-03 is a combination of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen.
 
In Study 301 bioequivalence (BE) was examined to generate information for future registration studies. Results demonstrated a trend toward BE for both active ingredients in LTX-03 formulations A through E. Formulation E had BE ratios (log transformed) for hydrocodone of 0.89 and 0.97 for Cmax and Area Under the Curve (AUC), respectively. In this small sample size study both hydrocodone BE confidence intervals were below the acceptable lower BE range of 0.80 at 0.74 and 0.79 for Cmax and AUC, respectively. For acetaminophen, Formulation E’s BE Ratios were 1.15 and 1.03 for Cmax and AUC, respectively. While the acetaminophen AUC’s met the BE standards, the Cmax upper confidence interval of 1.61 was above the acceptable upper BE range of 1.25. We believe that bioequivalence of this formulation may be achieved by reducing data variability that can be achieved through an adequately powered crossover study design with sufficient numbers of subjects in the study. For LTX-03 Formulations F though H, the higher buffer level tablets, Study 301 demonstrated a progressively increasing reduction in hydrocodone Cmax culminating in a 34% Cmax reduction associated with Formulation H, the highest level evaluated. The Cmax for acetaminophen did not decline in Formulations F through H in Study 301.
 
We believe that Study 301 identified a formulation that optimizes the balance between providing therapeutic blood levels of drug for pain relief at a single tablet dose while retarding the bioavailability of drug when higher buffer levels are ingested.
 
Manufacturing
 
We have completed with AD Pharma, commercial scale-up of the LTX-03 manufacturing process at a contract manufacturing organization. In February 2021, we completed manufacturing three NDA required registration/clinical batches of the to-be-marketed LTX-03 formulation on the commercial scale manufacturing equipment with quality assurance testing of the product pending before these batches can be deemed successful and ready for use. We will be required to complete a six month shelf life study on these tablets for submission in the NDA which will start once the tablets are deemed acceptable.
 
IND Update
 
We submitted an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND with respect to LTX-03, to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018, which became effective in April 2018. In February 2021, we submitted to the FDA an update to the LTX-03 IND with our proposed clinical protocols for further development of LTX-03. The clinical protocols includes:
 

· | A one tablet, single dose pharmacokinetic study in fasted, healthy adult subjects; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A 2, 5 and tablet single dose pharmacokinetic study in fasted, healthy adult subjects; and 
· | A one tablet, single dose pharmacokinetic study in fed, healthy adult subjects.

These studies also contains design components to evaluate certain pharmacologic data with respect to, among other things, acidic beverages and drug interactions. These design of these studies was based on advice letters received from the FDA but no guarantees can be made that these studies, even if successful, will be sufficient to warrant FDA approval.
 
We intend to advance LTX-03 to clinical development for a New Drug Application (NDA).
 
Non-clinical Study APT-RDR-300
 
Study APT-RDR-300 was a non-clinical study of respiratory depression in which five groups of 11 Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered doses of hydrocodone ranging from 100mg of drug per kg of body weight (mg/kg) up to 300 mg/kg and one group receiving placebo. 8 subjects in each group were measured for opioid induced respiratory depression (OIRD) assessing peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the blood over a 4 hour observation period. 36 subjects were analyzed as successfully completing the dosing. The additional 3 subjects in each group provided blood samples analyzed for hydrocodone at .5, 1, 2 and 4 hours post-dosing.
 
In Study APT-RDR-300 all doses above 100 mg/kg demonstrated with statistical significance (p<.05) SpO2 measured OIRD at all time points post-dosing. The 100 mg/kg dose was not statistically significant for OIRD at any time point post-dosing. The mortality rate was correlated with higher doses. In all animals exhibiting OIRD, OIRD was acutely evident within 30 minutes of dosing which was consistent with the Cmax of the hydrocodone dose. Increased Cmax was generally associated with an increased prevalence of acute OIRD (SpO2 ≤70%). Approximately 90% of animals reaching this acute OIRD level resulted in death. Due to a high variability in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observed in the study, no further associations were possible. Acura believes the results of this study generally support the development of opioid products with a reduction in Cmax in overdose situations.
 
Non-clinical Study APT-RDR-301
 
Study APT-RDR-301 was a non-clinical study of respiratory depression in which five groups of 10 Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered doses of hydrocodone ranging from 100mg of drug per kg of body weight (mg/kg) up to 300 mg/kg and one group receiving placebo. Subjects in each group were measured for OIRD assessing peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the blood at 30-miniutes post-dose. After the 30-minute SpO2 reading, a blood sample was taken from each subject.
 
In Study APT-RDR-301 all drug doses demonstrated with statistical significance (p<.05) SpO2 measured OIRD at 30-minutes post-dosing. The mortality rate was correlated with higher doses with a lethal dose in 50% of the animals (LD50) consistent with study APT-RDR-300. A regression analysis of individual subjects demonstrated a statistically significant association between Cmax and SpO2 at the 30-minute timepoint.
 
Since our non-clinical studies are to characterize the pharmacology of our tablet formulation and not the toxicologic safety of the active ingredients, these studies were not run in compliance with FDA’s current good laboratory practices.
 
AD Pharma Agreement covering LTX-03 
 
On June 28, 2019 we announced a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement, as amended in October 2020 (the "Agreement"), with Abuse Deterrent Pharma, LLC (“AD Pharma”), a special purpose company representing a consortium of investors that will finance Acura’s operations through July, 2021, and completion of development of LTX-03 (hydrocodone bitartrate with acetaminophen) immediate-release tablets utilizing Acura’s patented LIMITx™ technology which addresses the consequences of excess oral administration of opioid tablets, the most prevalent route of opioid overdose and abuse. AD Pharma retains commercialization rights from which Acura will be entitled to receive royalties and potential sales related milestones. AD Pharma also has licensed commercialization rights to LTX-02 (oxycodone/acetaminophen) and LTX-09 (alprazolam).
 
7

 


The Agreement grants AD Pharma exclusive commercialization rights in the United States to LTX-03. Financial arrangements include monthly license payments by AD Pharma of $350,000 up to April 2020 and $200,000 thereafter until the earlier of July 31, 2021 or FDA’s acceptance of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for LTX-03 and reimbursement by AD Pharma of Acura’s LTX-03 outside development expenses. Upon commercialization of LTX-03, Acura receives stepped royalties on sales and is eligible for certain sales related milestones. AD Pharma is delinquent in remitting monthly license payments for December, 2020 thru March, 2021 and approximately $100 thousand of reimbursable LTX-03 development expenses. Failure to make these payments are an event of default under the Agreement, as amended. Based upon representations by AD Pharma, we anticipate receipt of these past due amounts by April 30, 2021 and payment obligations through July, 2021, for which no assurance can be given.
 
AD Pharma may terminate the Agreement at any time. Additionally, if the NDA for LTX-03 is not accepted by the FDA by July 31, 2021, AD Pharma has the option to terminate the Agreement and take ownership of the LIMITx intellectual property. Should AD Pharma choose not to exercise this option to terminate and the NDA for LTX-03 is subsequently accepted by the FDA, such option expires. Acura expects the submission and FDA acceptance of the NDA for LTX-03 to now occur after July 31, 2021. Acura is currently in discussions with AD Pharma to amend the Agreement. There can be no assurance that AD Pharma will agree to extend the NDA filing acceptance date or that they will not take ownership of the intellectual property.
 
We also granted authority to MainPointe Pharmaceuticals, LLC (MainPointe) to assign to AD Pharma the option and the right to add, as an Option Product to the Nexafed® Agreement, a Nexafed® 12-hour dosage (an extended-release pseudoephedrine hydrochloride product utilizing the IMPEDE® Technology in 120mg dosage strength) and the Option Product exercise price of $500 thousand was waived if the exercise of the option occurred by June 28, 2024 (five years from the effective date of the AD Pharma Agreement), however effective with the October 2020 amendment to the AD Pharma Agreement, this option and right was rescinded. In March 2017, we granted MainPointe an exclusive license to our IMPEDE ® Technology to commercialize our Nexafed® and Nexafed® Sinus Pressure + Pain Products in the United States and Canada. On January 1, 2020, MainPointe assigned to AD Pharma, with Acura’s consent, all of its right, title and interest in the MainPointe Agreement between MainPointe and Acura dated March 16, 2017. We understand that MainPointe continues to market the Nexafed products.
 
Mr. Schutte is our largest shareholder and directly owns approximately 44.8% of our common stock (after giving effect to the exercise of warrants he holds) as of February 15, 2021. Mr. Schutte also controls MainPointe and is an investor in AD Pharma.
 
Aversion Technology 
 
Aversion Technology incorporates gelling ingredients and irritants into tablets to discourage abuse by snorting and provide barriers to abuse by injection. Our Aversion Technology and related opioid products, like Oxaydo, are covered by claims in six issued U.S. patents, which expire between November 2023 and March 2025. Our Aversion Technology products are intended to provide the same therapeutic benefits of the active drug ingredient as currently marketed products containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient.
Oxaydo Tablets
 
Oxaydo (oxycodone HCI tablets) is a Schedule II narcotic indicated for the management of acute and chronic moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. On January 7, 2015, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Assertio pursuant to which we exclusively licensed to Assertio worldwide rights to manufacture and commercialize Oxaydo. Oxaydo is approved in 5mg and 7.5mg strengths. Assertio commenced shipping Oxaydo in the United States in October 2015.
 
The safety and efficacy of Oxaydo 5mg and 7.5mg tablets was established by demonstrating bioequivalence to commercially available oxycodone immediate-release tablets in the fasted state. Oxaydo differs from oxycodone tablets when taken with a high fat meal though these differences are not considered clinically relevant, and Oxaydo can be taken without regard to food. The FDA-approved label for Oxaydo describes elements unique to our Aversion Technology, which differs from current commercially available oxycodone immediate-release tablets. The label for Oxaydo includes the results from a clinical study that evaluated the effects of nasally snorting crushed Oxaydo and commercially available oxycodone tablets, and limitations on exposing Oxaydo Tablets to water and other solvents and administration through feeding tubes. The clinical study evaluated 40 non-dependent recreational opioid users, who self-administered the equivalent of 15mg of oxycodone. After accounting for a first sequence effect, the study demonstrated:

· | 30% of subjects exposed to Oxaydo responded that they would not take the drug again compared to 5% of subjects exposed to immediate-release oxycodone;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | subjects taking Oxaydo reported a higher incidence of nasopharyngeal and facial adverse events compared to immediate-release oxycodone;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a decreased ability to completely insufflate two crushed Oxaydo Tablets within a fixed time period (21 of 40 subjects), while all subjects were able to completely insufflate the entire dose of immediate-release oxycodone; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | small numeric differences in the median and mean drug liking scores, which were lower in response to Oxaydo than immediate-release oxycodone.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We and Assertio have a post-approval commitment with the FDA to perform an epidemiology study to assess the actual impact on abuse of Oxaydo Tablets.
 
Further, the Oxaydo product label guides patients not to crush and dissolve the tablets or pre-soak, lick or otherwise wet the tablets prior to administration. Similarly, caregivers are advised not to crush and dissolve the tablets or otherwise use Oxaydo for administration via nasogastric, gastric or other feeding tubes as it may cause an obstruction. We believe that Assertio has shifted focus to marketing other products in their portfolio and deemphasized the marketing Oxaydo.
 
Assertio Agreement Covering Oxaydo
 
On January 7, 2015, we and Egalet US, Inc. and Egalet Ltd., each a subsidiary of Egalet Corporation, (now known as Assertio Holdings Inc.), entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Assertio Agreement, to commercialize Oxaydo Tablets containing our Aversion® Technology. Oxaydo is approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States in 5 mg and 7.5 mg strengths. Under the terms of the Assertio Agreement, we transferred the approved NDA for Oxaydo to Assertio and Assertio is granted an exclusive license under our intellectual property rights for development and commercialization of Oxaydo worldwide, or the Territory, in all strengths, subject to our right to co-promote Oxaydo in the United States.
 
In accordance with the Assertio Agreement, we and Assertio formed a joint steering committee to oversee commercialization strategies and the development of product line extensions. Assertio pays a significant portion of the expenses relating to (i) annual NDA PDUFA program fees, (ii) expenses of the FDA required post-marketing study for Oxaydo and (iii) expenses of clinical studies for product line extensions (additional strengths) of Oxaydo for the United States and pays all of the expenses of development and regulatory approval of Oxaydo for sale outside the United States. Assertio is responsible for all manufacturing and commercialization activities in the Territory for Oxaydo. Subject to certain exceptions, Assertio has final decision making authority with respect to all development and commercialization activities for Oxaydo, including pricing, subject to our co-promotion right. Assertio may develop Oxaydo for other countries and in additional strengths, in its discretion.
 
Assertio paid us an upfront payment of $5.0 million upon signing of the Assertio Agreement and a $2.5 million milestone in October 2015 in connection with the launch of Oxaydo. In addition, we will be entitled to a one-time $12.5 million milestone payment when worldwide Oxaydo net sales reach $150.0 million in a calendar year. In addition, we are entitled to receive from Assertio a stepped royalty at percentage rates ranging from mid-single digits to double-digits on net sales during a calendar year based on Oxaydo net sales during such year (excluding net sales resulting from our co-promotion efforts). In any calendar year in which net sales exceed a specified threshold, we will receive a double digit royalty on all Oxaydo net sales in that year (excluding net sales resulting from our co-promotion efforts). If we exercise our co-promotion rights, we will receive a share of the gross margin attributable to incremental Oxaydo net sales from our co-promotion activities. Assertio’s royalty payment obligations commenced on the first commercial sale of Oxaydo and expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire valid patent claim covering Oxaydo in such country (or if there are no patent claims in such country, then upon the expiration of the last valid claim in the United States or the date when no valid and enforceable listable patent in the FDA’s Orange Book remains with respect to the Product). Royalties will be reduced upon the entry of generic equivalents, as well as for payments required to be made by Assertio to acquire intellectual property rights to commercialize Oxaydo, with an aggregate minimum floor.

The Assertio Agreement expires upon the expiration of Assertio’s royalty payment obligations in all countries. Either party may terminate the Assertio Agreement in its entirety if the other party breaches a payment obligation, or otherwise materially breaches the Assertio Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods, or in the event the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, files a petition in bankruptcy or otherwise seeks relief under applicable bankruptcy laws. We also may terminate the Assertio Agreement with respect to the U.S. and other countries if Assertio materially breaches its commercialization obligations. Assertio may terminate the Assertio Agreement for convenience on 120 days prior written notice. Termination does not affect a party’s rights accrued prior thereto, but there are no stated payments in connection with termination other than payments of obligations previously accrued. For all terminations (but not expiration), the Assertio Agreement provides for the transition of development and marketing of Oxaydo from Assertio to us, including the conveyance by Assertio to us of the trademarks and all regulatory filings and approvals relating to Oxaydo, and for Assertio’s supply of Oxaydo for a transition period.
 
As part of a 2020 restructuring by Assertio, it is our understanding that they have decided to reduce selling efforts pertaining to Oxaydo and as such, we expect royalties to decline over the remainder of the Agreement.
 
KemPharm Agreement Covering Opioid Prodrugs
 
On October 13, 2016, we and KemPharm Inc., or KemPharm, entered into a worldwide License Agreement, or the KemPharm Agreement, pursuant to which we licensed our Aversion® Technology to KemPharm for its use in the development and commercialization of three products using 2 of KemPharm’s prodrug candidates. KemPharm has also been granted an option to extend the KemPharm Agreement to cover two additional prodrug candidates. KemPharm is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, although we may provide initial technical assistance.
 
Upon execution of the KemPharm Agreement, KemPharm paid us an upfront payment of $3.5 million. If KemPharm exercises its option to use our Aversion Technology with more than the 2 prodrugs licensed, then KemPharm will pay us up to $1.0 million for each additional prodrug license. In addition, we will receive from KemPharm a low single digit royalty on commercial sales by KemPharm of products developed using our Aversion Technology under the KemPharm Agreement. KemPharm’s royalty payment obligations commence on the first commercial sale of a product using our Aversion Technology and expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire patent claim of the Aversion Technology covering a product in such country, at which time the license for the particular product and country becomes fully paid and royalty free. As of December 31, 2020 we are unaware of KemPharm’s use of our Aversion technology under the KemPharm Agreement.
 
The KemPharm Agreement expires upon the expiration of KemPharm’s royalty payment obligations in all countries. Either party may terminate the KemPharm Agreement in its entirety if the other party materially breaches the KemPharm Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods. Acura or KemPharm may terminate the KemPharm Agreement with respect to the U.S. and other countries if the other party challenges the patents covering the licensed products. KemPharm may terminate the KemPharm Agreement for convenience on ninety (90) days prior written notice. Termination does not affect a party’s rights accrued prior thereto, but there are no stated payments in connection with termination other than payments of obligations previously accrued. For all terminations (but not expiration), the KemPharm Agreement provides for termination of our license grant to KemPharm.
 
Aversion Technology Development Opioid Products
 
We have suspended further development of our Aversion hydrocodone/APAP product candidate, in order to focus our time and available resources on the development of our LIMITx Technology product candidates. We currently have 6 additional opioids at various stages of formulation development using the Aversion Technology which are not being actively developed.

Abuse of Pseudoephedrine Products
 
The 2019 CDC Drug Surveillance Report reported two million Americans aged 12 or older having used methamphetamine in the past year. From 2015-2018, an estimated 1.6 million U.S. adults aged ≥18 years, on average, reported past-year methamphetamine use. A 2018 study by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis found that methamphetamine use has increased significantly among people with an existing opioid use disorder (OUD). People with OUD in their study reported substituting methamphetamine for opioids when the latter are hard to obtain or are perceived as unsafe, or that they sought a synergistic high by combining them. People who purposefully combine heroin and cocaine or methamphetamine report that the stimulant helps to balance out the sedative effect of opioids, enabling them to function “normally.” However, the combination can enhance the drugs’ toxicity and lethality, by exacerbating their individual cardiovascular and respiratory effects.
 
The chemical structure of pseudoephedrine, or PSE, is very similar to methamphetamine, facilitating a straight-forward chemical conversion to methamphetamine. OTC PSE products are sometimes purchased and used for this conversion. There are multiple known processes to convert PSE to methamphetamine, all of which are not complex and do not require specialized equipment; however, many do require readily available but uncommon ingredients. Two of the three most popular processes follow two general processing steps: (1) dissolving the PSE tablets in a solvent to isolate, by filtration, purified PSE and (2) a chemical reduction of the PSE into methamphetamine for drying into crystals. The third method, or the “one-pot” method, involves the direct chemical reduction of the PSE to methamphetamine in the presence of the tablet’s inactive ingredients. All the solvents used are ultimately dried off or otherwise removed, so a wide range of solvents are amenable to the process.
 
Impede Technology Products
 
Our initial Impede 1.0 Technology being used in Nexafed Sinus Pressure + Pain contains a proprietary mixture of inactive ingredients, prevents the extraction of PSE from tablets using known extraction methods and disrupts the direct conversion of PSE from tablets into methamphetamine.
 
We have developed a next generation Impede 2.0 Technology with additional inactive ingredients to improve the meth-resistance of our technology which is currently used in Nexafed Tablets. One-pot, direct conversion meth testing performed by our CRO on the following commercially available products resulted in:
 

Product/Formulation | Meth Resistant Technology | Meth Recovery1 | | | Purity2
---------------------------------------+----------------------------+----------------+----+---+--------
Sudafed® 30mg Tablets | None | | 67 | % | | 62 | %
Nexafed 30mg Technology | Impede® 1.0 | | 38 | % | | 65 | %
Zephrex-D® 30mg Pills | Tarex® | | 28 | % | | 51 | %
Nexafed 120mg Extended-release tablets | Impede® 2.0 | | 17 | % | | 34 | %

 
1 Total methamphetamine HCl recovered from the equivalent of 100 PSE 30mg tablets divided by the maximum theoretical yield of 2.7 grams.
 2 Total methamphetamine HCl recovered from the equivalent of 100 PSE 30mg tablets divided by the total weight of powder recovered.
 
We have previously demonstrated in a pilot clinical study the bioequivalence of a formulation of our Nexafed extended release tablets utilizing our Impede 2.0 Technology to Sudafed® 12-hour Tablets.
 
Nexafed Products and the MainPointe Agreement
 
Nexafed and Nexafed Sinus Pressure + Pain, consist of immediate release tablets. Nexafed is a 30mg pseudoephedrine tablet which until the third quarter of 2017 incorporated our patented Impede 1.0 Technology and commencing in such quarter incorporated our Impede 2.0 Technology. Nexafed Sinus Pressure + Pain is a 30/325mg pseudoephedrine and acetaminophen tablet which incorporates our Nexafed 1.0 Technology. PSE is a widely-used nasal decongestant available in many non-prescription and prescription cold, sinus and allergy products. While the 30mg PSE tablet is not the largest selling PSE product on the market, we believe it is the most often used product to make meth due to: (a) its relatively low selling price and (b) its simpler formulation provides better meth yields.
 
We have demonstrated that our Nexafed 30mg tablets are bioequivalent to Johnson & Johnson’s Sudafed 30mg Tablets when a single 2 tablet dose is administered. Commencing in 2006, the CMEA, required all non-prescription PSE products to be held securely behind the pharmacy counter, has set monthly consumer purchase volume limits, and has necessitated consumer interaction with pharmacy personnel to purchase PSE-containing products.
 
11

 

On March 16, 2017, we and MainPointe entered into a License, Commercialization and Option Agreement, or the MainPointe Agreement, pursuant to which we granted MainPointe an exclusive license to our Impede Technology to commercialize our Nexafed products in the U.S. and Canada. We also conveyed to MainPointe our existing inventory and equipment relating to our Nexafed products. MainPointe is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities with respect to products covered by the Agreement and controls the marketing and sale of our Nexafed products.
 
On signing the MainPointe Agreement, MainPointe paid us an upfront licensing fee of $2.5 million plus approximately $425 thousand for inventory and equipment being transferred. The MainPointe Agreement also provides for our receipt of a 7.5% royalty on net sales of licensed products. The royalty payment for each product will expire on a country-by-country basis when the Impede® patent rights for such country have expired or are no longer valid; provided that if no Impede patent right exists in a country, then the royalty term for that country will be the same as the royalty term for the United States. After the expiration of a royalty term for a country, MainPointe retains a royalty free license to our Impede® Technology for products covered by the Agreement in such country.
 
MainPointe has the option to expand the licensed territory beyond the United States and Canada to the European Union (and the United Kingdom), Japan and South Korea for payments of $1.0 million, $500 thousand and $250 thousand, respectively. In addition, MainPointe has the option to add to the MainPointe Agreement certain additional products, or Option Products, containing PSE and utilizing the Impede Technology for a fee of $500 thousand per product (for all product strengths), including the product candidate Loratadine with pseudoephedrine. MainPointe has assigned and transferred its option rights to a Nexafed 12-hour formulation to AD Pharma. If the territory has been expanded prior to the exercise of a product option, the option fee will be increased to $750 thousand per product. If the territory is expanded after the payment of the $500 thousand product option fee, a one-time $250 thousand fee will be due for each product. If a third party is interested in developing or licensing rights to an Option Product, MainPointe must exercise its option for that product or its option rights for such product will terminate. On June 28, 2019, we granted authority to MainPointe to assign to AD Pharma the option and the right to add, as an Option Product to the Nexafed® Agreement, a Nexafed® 12-hour dosage (an extended-release pseudoephedrine hydrochloride product utilizing the IMPEDE® Technology in 120mg dosage strength) and waived the $500 thousand option fee, however effective with the October 2020 amendment to the AD Pharma Agreement, this option and right was rescinded.
 
The MainPointe Agreement may be terminated by either party for a material breach of the other party, or by Acura if MainPointe challenges certain of its patents. Upon early termination of the MainPointe Agreement, MainPointe’s licenses to the Impede Technology and all products will terminate. Upon termination, at Acura’s request the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to transition the Nexafed® and Nexafed® Sinus Pressure + Pain products back to Acura.
 
On January 1, 2020, MainPointe assigned to AD Pharma, with Acura’s consent, all of its right, title and interest in the MainPointe Agreement between MainPointe and Acura dated March 16, 2017.
 
Other Impede Technology Products 
 
Given the fragmented nature of the PSE market with products containing multiple active ingredients, we have developed additional products for our Nexafed franchise:
 

Impede Technology Products | Status 
-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extended-release formulation utilizing Impede 2.0 Technology | Pilot pharmacokinetic testing demonstrated bioequivalence to Sudafed® 12-hour Tablets. Pre-IND meeting held with the FDA No imminent development planned 
Extended-release combination products | No imminent development planned 
Loratadine with pseudoephedrine | No imminent development planned 

 

12

 

In July 2015, we had a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss the results from our pharmacokinetic and meth-resistance testing studies to determine the development path for our extended-release development product. The FDA acknowledged the potential value of the development of risk-mitigating strategies for new formulations of pseudoephedrine products while also recognizing an approved “meth-deterrent” extended release pseudoephedrine product would be novel in the over-the-counter (OTC) setting. The FDA did not make a formal determination whether “meth-resistant” claims would be appropriate but is open to consider such an appropriately worded, evidence-based claim directed to the consumer and/or retailer. As recommended by the FDA, we have submitted additional “meth-resistant” testing information to the FDA for review prior to submitting an IND. In October 2016, we received FDA recommendations on our meth-resistant testing protocols for our Nexafed extended release tablets. We can now scale-up our manufacture batch size at a contract manufacturer which allows us to submit an IND to the FDA for our Nexafed extended release tablets, however, we have not yet committed to that level of development.
 
In March 2017, we completed a pilot pharmacokinetic study for the PSE and Loratadine combination product using our Impede 1.0 Technology. The study in 24 healthy adult subjects demonstrated sufficient, but not bioequivalent blood levels of PSE to the comparator while the second active ingredient achieved bioequivalence. Based on the product profile, we believe this formulation can be moved into final development for a 505(b)(2) NDA submission. The Company has upgraded a portion of this formulation with its Impede 2.0 Technology.
 
U.S. Market Opportunity for Impede PSE Products
 
PSE is a widely-used nasal decongestant available in many non-prescription and prescription cold, sinus and allergy products. PSE is sold in products as the only active ingredient in both immediate and extended-release products. In addition, PSE is combined with other cold, sinus and allergy ingredients such as pain relievers, cough suppressants and antihistamines. PSE also competes against phenylephrine, an alternate nasal decongestant available in non-prescription products. The top retail selling PSE OTC cold/allergy products are:
 

Reference Brand1 | Brand Company | Active Ingredient(s)
-----------------+---------------+---------------------
Claritin-D | Bayer | PSE & Loraditine2 
Allegra-D | Chattem | PSE & Fexofenadine2 
Zyrtec-D | Pfizer | PSE & Ceterizine2 
Advil Sinus | Pfizer | PSE & Ibuprofen 
Sudafed 12 Hour | J&J | PSE2 
Sudafed 30mg | J&J | PSE 

  
1 Branded product only. Does not include store brand sales.
 2 Extended release PSE formulations
 
MainPointe controls the price of Nexafed and Nexafed Sinus under the terms of the MainPointe Agreement. The market for cold, sinus and allergy products is highly competitive and many products have strong consumer brand recognition and, in some cases, prescription drug heritage. Category leading brands are often supported by national mass marketing and promotional efforts. Consumers often have a choice to purchase a less expensive store brand. Store brands contain the same active ingredients as the more popular national brands but are not supported by large marketing campaigns and are offered at a lower price. Non-prescription products are typically distributed through retail outlets including drug store chains, food store chains, independent pharmacies and mass merchandisers.
 
Product Labeling for Impede Technology Products
 
Nexafed and Nexafed Sinus Pressure + Pain products are marketed pursuant to the FDA’s OTC Monograph regulations, which require that our products have labeling as specified in the regulations. Marketing for the Nexafed products includes advertising the extraction characteristics and methamphetamine-resistant benefits of these products which is supported by our published research studies.
 
We expect that any of our other Impede Technology products that are marketed pursuant to an NDA or ANDA will be subject to a label approved by the FDA. We expect that such a label will require submission of our scientifically derived abuse liability data and we intend to seek descriptions of our abuse liability studies in the FDA approved product label, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case.

U.S. Market Opportunity for Opioid Analgesic Products
 
According to the Centers for Drug Control’s 2019 Drug Surveillance Report, opioid analgesics are one of the largest prescription drug markets in the United States with 153 million prescriptions dispensed in 2019 comprised of approximately 139 million and 14 million, immediate and extended release prescriptions, respectively. Further, it is estimated in 2018 that nationally, approximately 49.5 million people, across all age groups, received at least one opioid prescription. CDC data for 2016 identified hydrocodone and oxycodone as the most widely prescribed opioids with 6.2 billion hydrocodone pills/tablets and 5 billion oxycodone pills/tablets distributed in the US.
 
We expect our LIMITx Technology and Aversion opioid products, to compete primarily in the IR segment of the United States opioid analgesic market. Because IR opioid products are used for both acute and chronic pain, a prescription, on average, contains 66 tablets or capsules. According to IMS Health, in 2016, sales in the IR opioid product segment were approximately $2.7 billion, of which ~98% was attributable to generic products. Due to fewer identified competitors and the significantly larger market for dispensed prescriptions for IR opioid products compared to ER opioid products, we have initially focused on developing IR opioid products utilizing our Aversion and LIMITx Technologies.
 
Product Labeling for Products Using Our Technologies
 
We or our licensee may seek to include descriptions of studies that characterize the safety features of our technologies in the label for our products in development. Assertio has committed to undertake FDA required epidemiological studies to assess the actual consequences of abuse of Oxaydo in the market for which we share a minority portion of appropriate fees and expenses. The extent to which a description of the results of epidemiological or other studies will be added to or included in the FDA approved product label for our products in development will be the subject of our discussions with the FDA as part of the NDA review process. Further, because the FDA closely regulates promotional materials, even if FDA initially approves labeling that includes a description of the properties of the product, the FDA’s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, or OPDP, will continue to review the acceptability of promotional labeling claims and product advertising campaigns for our marketed products.
 
In April 2015, the FDA published guidance for industry on the evaluation and labeling of abuse-deterrent opioids and in June 2019, FDA issued a draft for public comment guidance on a Benefit-Risk Assessment Framework for Opioid Analgesic Drugs which may be beneficial to use in the development and labeling of our product candidates.

In addition to our issued patents listed above and additional unlisted issued patents, we have filed multiple U.S. patent applications and international patent applications relating to compositions containing abusable active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as applications covering our Impede 1.0 and 2.0 Technologies and filed U.S. patent applications for our LIMITx Technology. Except for the rights granted in the Assertio Agreement, the KemPharm Agreement, the MainPointe Agreement, and the AD Pharma Agreement and in the patent infringement settlement agreements described below, we have retained all intellectual property rights to our Aversion Technology, Impede Technology, LIMITx Technology and related product candidates.
 
Between October, 2013 and May, 2014 we settled on an individual basis, patent infringement suits we brought against generic manufacturers Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Impax Laboratories, Inc., Sandoz Inc. and Ranbaxy Inc. initiated by their seeking to market generic versions of Oxaydo. Principally, the settlements grant to Par a royalty bearing license to use our Aversion Technology patents in an immediate-release oxycodone product starting in January 2022, or sooner depending on other generic competition. None of such settlements impacted the validity or enforceability of our Patents.
 
On May 20, 2016, we, Purdue Pharma L.P. and Assertio settled patent infringement actions initiated by Purdue against Oxaydo and an Intes Parties Review initiated by us against a Purdue patent. The parties dismissed or withdrew the actions, requested that the USPTO terminate the IPR Review and exchanged mutual releases. No payments were made by the parties under the settlement agreement. The settlement provides that Acura will not, in the future, assert certain Acura U.S. Aversion Technology patents against selected Purdue immediate and extended-release products. In addition, Purdue has certain rights to negotiate to exclusively distribute an authorized generic version of certain Assertio products, including, in some circumstances, Oxaydo® and other products using Acura’s Aversion® Technology if licensed to Assertio.
 
Reference is made to the Risk Factors contained in this Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion, among other things, of patent applications and patents owned by third parties, including claims that may encompass our Aversion Technology and Oxaydo Tablets, and the risk of infringement, interference or opposition proceedings that we may be subject to arising from such patents and patent applications.
 
Research and Manufacturing
 
We conduct research, development, manufacture of laboratory clinical trial supplies, and warehousing activities at our operations facility in Culver, Indiana and lease an administrative office in Palatine, Illinois. The 25,000 square foot Culver facility is registered with the DEA to perform research, development and manufacture of certain DEA-scheduled active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dosage form products. We have obtained quotas for supply of DEA-scheduled active pharmaceutical ingredients from the DEA and develop finished dosage forms in our Culver facility. We manufacture clinical trial supplies of drug products in our Culver facility. In addition to internal capabilities and activities, we engage numerous clinical research organizations, or CROs, with expertise in regulatory affairs, clinical trial design and monitoring, clinical data management, biostatistics, medical writing, laboratory testing and related services. Assertio is responsible for commercial manufacture of Oxaydo under the Assertio Agreement. We expect that future opioid product candidates developed and licensed by us will be commercially manufactured by our licensees or other qualified third party contract manufacturers.
 
16

 

Prior to our entering into the MainPointe Agreement, we relied on two contract manufacturers to manufacture, package and supply our commercial quantities of Nexafed and Nexafed Sinus Pressure + Pain products. We assigned our existing supply agreement to MainPointe in accordance with the terms of the MainPointe Agreement. Although we believe there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy MainPointe’s anticipated commercial requirements, replacing or adding a contract manufacturer may cause an interruption in supply and could adversely impact our royalties from MainPointe on the net sales of the Nexafed products.
 
Competition
 
Our products and technologies will, if marketed, compete to varying degrees against both brand and generic products offering similar therapeutic benefits and being developed and marketed by small and large pharmaceutical (for prescription products) and consumer packaged goods (for OTC products) companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources and are able to expend more funds and effort than us and our licensees in research, development and commercialization of their competitive technologies and products. Prescription generic products and OTC store brand products will offer cost savings to third party payers and/or consumers that will create pricing pressure on our or our licensed products. Also, these competitors may have a substantial sales volume advantage over our products, which may result in our costs of manufacturing being higher than our competitors’ costs.
 
We believe potential competitors may be developing opioid abuse deterrent technologies and products. Such potential competitors include, but may not be limited to, Pfizer Inc., Purdue Pharma, Atlantic Pharmaceuticals, KemPharm, Shionogi, Pisgah Labs, Ensysce Biopharma, Inspirion Delivery Sciences and Collegium Pharmaceuticals.
 
Our Impede Technology products containing PSE will compete in the highly competitive market for cold, sinus and allergy products generally available to the consumer without a prescription. Some of our competitors will have multiple consumer product offerings both within and outside the cold, allergy and sinus category providing them with substantial leverage in dealing with a highly consolidated pharmacy distribution network. The competing products may have well established brand names and may be supported by national or regional advertising. Nexafed will compete primarily with Johnson & Johnson’s Sudafed brand and Nexafed Sinus Pressure + Pain with Pfizer’s Advil brand Cold and Sinus, as well as generic/store brand formulations of such products manufactured by Perrigo Company and others. A competing product from Perrigo is being marketed with claims of methamphetamine-resistance.
 
In addition to our license agreement with MainPointe/AD Pharma, we may consider licensing our Impede Technology or other products utilizing such technology for commercialization.
 
Government Regulation 
 
All pharmaceutical firms, including us, are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, principally by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, and, to a lesser extent, by state and local governments. Before our prescription products and some OTC products may be marketed in the U.S., they must be approved by the FDA for commercial distribution. Certain OTC products must comply with applicable FDA regulations, known as OTC Monographs, in order to be marketed, but do not require FDA review and approval before marketing. Additionally, we are subject to extensive regulation by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act, the Combat Methamphetamine Act of 2005, and related laws and regulations for research, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of controlled substances and certain other pharmaceutical active ingredients that are regulated as Listed Chemicals. Extensive FDA, DEA, and state regulation of our products and commercial operations continues after drug product approvals, and the requirements for our continued marketing of our products may change even after initial approval. We are also subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws, including requirements regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and may be subject to other present and future local, state, federal and foreign regulations, including possible future regulations of the pharmaceutical industry. We cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and other regulatory developments concerning our products and the healthcare industry in general.

The FD&C Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, quality control, export and import, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, pricing, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements both before and after approval, can subject us, our third party manufacturers and other collaborative partners to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as, among other things, warning letters, fines and other monetary payments, recall or seizure of products, criminal proceedings, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, interruption or cessation of clinical trials, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, limitations on or the limitation of claims we can make for our products, and refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts for distribution directly by governmental agencies, or delay in approving or refusal to approve new drug applications. The FDA also has the authority to revoke or withhold approvals of new drug applications.
 
FDA approval is required before any “new drug,” can be marketed. A “new drug” is one not generally recognized, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience, as safe and effective for its intended use. Our products not subject to and in compliance with an OTC Monograph are new drugs and require prior FDA approval. Such approval must be based on extensive information and data submitted in a NDA, including but not limited to adequate and well controlled laboratory and clinical investigations to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for its intended use(s) as well as the manufacturing suitability of the product. In addition to providing required safety and effectiveness data for FDA approval, a drug manufacturer’s practices and procedures must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”), which apply to manufacturing, receiving, holding and shipping, and include, among other things, demonstration of product purity, consistent manufacturing and quality and at least six months of data supporting product expiration dating based on clinical registration batches. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in all applicable areas relating to quality assurance and regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMPs. Failure to so comply risks delays in approval of drug products and possible FDA enforcement actions, such as an injunction against shipment of products, the seizure of non-complying products, criminal prosecution and/or any of the other possible consequences described above. We are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and DEA, which inspections may or may not be announced in advance.
 
The FDA Drug Approval Process
 
The process of drug development is complex and lengthy. The activities undertaken before a new pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S. generally include, but are not limited to, preclinical studies; submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become active before human clinical trials may commence; adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product; submission to the FDA of an NDA; acceptance for filing of the NDA by FDA; satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the clinical trial sites and manufacturing facility or facilities at which both the active ingredients and finished drug product are produced to assess compliance with, among other things, patient informed consent requirements, the clinical trial protocols, current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and cGMPs; and FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial sale and distribution of the product in the U.S.
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, and in some cases, animal studies and other studies to preliminarily assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The results of preclinical studies together with manufacturing information, analytical data, and detailed information including protocols for proposed human clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as a part of an IND. An IND must become effective, and approval must be obtained from an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. The IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA unless the FDA objects to, or otherwise raises concerns or questions and imposes a clinical hold. We, the FDA or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time after it has commenced due to safety or efficacy concerns or for commercial reasons. In the event that FDA objects to the IND and imposes a clinical hold, the IND sponsor must address any outstanding FDA concerns or questions to the satisfaction of the FDA before clinical trials can proceed or resume. There can be no assurance that submission of an IND will result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials.
 
18

 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three phases that may sometimes overlap or be combined:
 
Phase 1: This phase is typically the first involving human participants, and involves the smallest number of human participants (typically, 20-50). The investigational drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In addition, it is sometimes possible to gain a preliminary indication of efficacy.
Phase 2: Once the preliminary safety and tolerability of the drug in humans is confirmed during phase 1, phase 2 involves studies in a somewhat larger group of study subjects. Unlike phase 1 studies, which typically involve healthy subjects, participants in phase 2 studies may be affected by the disease or condition for which the product candidate is being developed. Phase 2 studies are intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, and to determine appropriate dosage and tolerance.
Phase 3: Phase 3 trials typically involve a large numbers of patients affected by the disease or condition for which the product candidate is being developed. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety under conditions resembling those for which the product will be used in actual clinical practice after FDA approval of the NDA. Phase 3 trials are typically the most costly and time-consuming of the clinical phases.
 
Phase 4 or Post-Marketing Requirements: Phase 4 trials may be required by FDA after the approval of the NDA for the product, as a condition of the approval, or may be undertaken voluntarily by the sponsor of the trial. The purpose of phase 4 trials is to continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug on a long-term basis and in a much larger and more diverse patient population than was included in the prior phases of clinical investigation.
 
After clinical trials have been completed, and if they were considered successful, the sponsor may submit a NDA or Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, to the FDA including the results of the preclinical and clinical testing, together with, and among other things, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacturing, quality controls, and proposed product labeling. There are two types of NDAs; a 505(b)(1) NDA and a 505(b)(2) NDA. A 505(b)(1) NDA is also known as a “full NDA” and is described by section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act as an application containing full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, in addition to other information. The data in a full NDA is either owned by the applicant or are data for which the applicant has obtained a right of reference. A 505(b)(2) application is one described under section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act as an application for which information, or one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval, “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted”. This provision permits the FDA to rely for approval of an NDA on data not developed by the applicant, such as published literature or the FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness of a previously approved drug. 505(b)(2) applications are submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act and are therefore subject to the same statutory provisions that govern 505(b)(1) applications that require among other things, “full reports” of safety and effectiveness.
 
The 505(b)(2) NDAs must include one of several different types of patent certifications to each patent that is listed in the FDA publication known as the Orange Book in connection with any previously approved drug, the approval of which is relied upon for approval of the 505(b)(2) NDA. Depending on the type of certification made, the approval of the 505(b)(2) NDA may be delayed until the relevant patent(s) expire, or in the case of a Paragraph IV Certification may lead to patent litigation against the applicant and a potential automatic approval delay of 30 months or more.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017, PDUFA VI, the FDA collects two types of fees associated with NDAs – (i) a fee collected at the time applications are submitted, and (ii) prescription drug program fees (accounting for 80% of the total), which are collected annually for certain prescription drugs. Exceptions to the application fee include previously filed applications and applications for drugs designated as orphan drugs for a rare disease.
 
According to FDA’s fee schedule, posted on August 3, 2020, for the 2021 fiscal year, the user fee for an application fee requiring clinical data, such as an NDA is $2,875,842. The FDA adjusts PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. A written request can be submitted for a waiver of the application fee for the first human drug application that is filed by a small business. Where we are subject to these fees, they are significant expenditures that may be incurred in the future and must be paid at the time of submission of each application to FDA.
 
19

 

After an NDA is submitted by an applicant, and if it is accepted for filing by the FDA, the FDA will then review the NDA and, if and when it determines that the data submitted are adequate to show that the product is safe and effective for its intended use, the FDA will approve the product for commercial distribution in the U.S. There can be no assurance that any of our products in development will receive FDA approval or that even if approved, they will be approved with labeling that includes descriptions of its abuse deterrent features. Moreover, even if our products in development are approved with labeling that includes descriptions of the abuse deterrent features of our products, advertising and promotion for the products will be limited to the specific claims and descriptions in the FDA approved product labeling.
 
In terms of program fees, subject to certain exceptions, each sponsor is required to pay the annual fee for each new prescription drug approved as of 1 October of each fiscal year (for 2021 such fee is $336,432 per product strength), but applicants may not be assessed more than five prescription drug program fees for a fiscal year, for prescription drugs identified in a single application. For example, an applicant that has 10 drug products identified in an approved NDA for 10 different strengths of tablet dosage form products is eligible for an assessment for a maximum of 5 program fees. PDUFA VI also eliminated fees for drug application supplements and establishment fees.
 
The FDA requires drug manufacturers to establish and maintain quality control procedures for manufacturing, processing and holding drugs and investigational products, and products must be manufactured in accordance with defined specifications. Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility(ies) at which the active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless it finds that cGMP compliance at those facility(ies) are satisfactory. If the FDA determines the NDA is not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the NDA and often will request additional information, thus delaying the approval of a product. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional testing or information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the criteria for approval. After a product is approved, changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or changes in or additions to the approved labeling for the product, may require submission of a new NDA or, in some instances, an NDA amendment, for further FDA review. Post-approval marketing of products in larger or different patient populations than those that were studied during development can lead to new findings about the safety or efficacy of the products. This information can lead to a product sponsor’s requesting approval for and/or the FDA requiring changes in the labeling of the product or even the withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, became law in 2002 and was subsequently reauthorized and amended by FDAAA. The reauthorization of BPCA provides an additional six months of market exclusivity beyond the expiration date of existing market exclusivities or eligible patents to NDA applicants that conduct acceptable pediatric studies of new and currently-marketed drug products for which pediatric information would be beneficial, as identified by FDA in a Pediatric Written Request. The FD&C Act, as amended by the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires that most applications for drugs and biologics include a pediatric assessment (unless waived or deferred) to ensure the drugs’ and biologics’ safety and effectiveness in children. Such pediatric assessment must contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective. The pediatric assessments can only be deferred provided there is a timeline for the completion of such studies. FDA may waive (partially or fully) the pediatric assessment requirement for several reasons, including if the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed. The FDA has indicated our Oxaydo product is exempt from the pediatric studies requirement of the PREA.
 
The terms of approval of any NDA for our product candidates, including the indication and product labeling (and, consequently permissible advertising and promotional claims we can make) may be more restrictive than what is sought in the NDA or what is desired by us. Additionally, the FDA conditioned approval of our Oxaydo product on our commitment to conduct Phase 4 epidemiological studies to assess the actual abuse levels of Oxaydo in the market. The testing and FDA approval process for our product candidates requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
20

 

Further, drug products approved by FDA may be subject to continuing obligations intended to assure safe use of the products. Specifically, under the FD&C Act, as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, FDA may require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, to manage known or potential serious risks associated with drugs or biological products. If FDA finds, at the time of approval or afterward, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of our products outweigh the risks associated with the products, FDA will require a REMS and, consequently, that we take additional measures to ensure safe use of the product. Components of a REMS may include, but are not limited to, a Medication Guide and/or Patient Package Insert, a marketing and sales communication plan for patients or healthcare providers concerning the drug, Elements To Assure Safe Use, or ETASUs such as, but not limited to, patient, prescriber, and pharmacy registries, and restrictions on the extent or methods of distribution, a REMS implementation system, and a timetable for assessment of the effectiveness of the REMS. Currently, all extended-release or long-acting (ERLA) opioid products approved by the FDA are subject to a class-wide REMS program. The FDA has determined that a REMS is necessary for immediate release opioid analgesics and has begun the process of incorporating immediate-release opioids into this class-wide REMS program.
 
In addition, we, our suppliers and our licensees are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements both before and after approval. For example, we or our licensees are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning the advertising and promotion of our products, which, as discussed above, may significantly affect the extent to which we can include statements or claims referencing our technology in product labeling and advertising. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to avoid the product being rendered misbranded and/or adulterated under the FD&C Act as a result of manufacturing problems. In addition, discovery of any material safety issues may result in changes to product labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer, potentially including removal of the product from the market.
 
Whether or not FDA NDA approval in the U.S. has been obtained, approvals from comparable governmental regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercialization of our drug products in those countries. The approval procedure varies in complexity from country to country, and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
FDA’s OTC Monograph Process
 
The FDA regulates certain non-prescription drugs using an OTC Monograph which, when final, is published in the Code of Federal Regulations at 21 C.F.R. Parts 330-358. For example, 21 C.F.R. Part 341 sets forth the products, such as pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, that may be marketed as an OTC cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator, or antiasthmatic drug product in a form suitable for oral, inhalant, or topical administration and is generally recognized as safe and effective and is not misbranded. Such products that meet each of the conditions established in the OTC Monograph regulations and the other applicable regulations may be marketed without prior approval by the FDA.
 
The general conditions set forth for OTC Monograph products include, among other things:
 

· | the product is manufactured at FDA registered establishments and in accordance with cGMPs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the product label meets applicable format and content requirements including permissible “Indications” and all required dosing instructions and limitations, warnings, precautions and contraindications that have been established in an applicable OTC Monograph;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the product contains only permissible active ingredients in permissible strengths and dosage forms;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the product container and container components meet FDA’s requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
21

 

The advertising for OTC drug products is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which generally requires that advertising claims be truthful, not misleading, and substantiated by adequate and reliable scientific evidence. False, misleading, or unsubstantiated OTC drug advertising may be subject to FTC enforcement action and may also be challenged in court by competitors or others under the federal Lanham Act or similar state laws. Penalties for false or misleading advertising may include monetary fines or judgments as well as injunctions against further dissemination of such advertising claims.
 
A product marketed pursuant to an OTC Monograph must be registered with the FDA and have a National Drug Code listing which is required for all marketed drug products. After marketing, the FDA may test the product or otherwise investigate the manufacturing and development of the product to ensure compliance with the OTC Monograph. Should the FDA determine that a product is not marketed in compliance with the OTC Monograph or is advertised outside of its regulations, the FDA may require corrective action up to and including market withdrawal and market recall.
 
DEA Regulation 
 
Our Oxaydo product is, and several of our products in development, if approved and marketed, will be, regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the loss and diversion of potentially abused drugs into illicit channels of commerce and closely monitors and regulates handlers of controlled substances, and the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging.
 
The DEA designates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V or as List I Chemicals. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. List I Chemicals are used to regulate potentially abused raw materials, such as pseudoephedrine HCl. We believe all of our products will receive DEA Scheduling consistent with current DEA Scheduling standards. For example, Oxaydo Tablets are listed as a Schedule II controlled substances under the CSA, the same as all other oxycodone HCl products. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use will be subject to a high degree of regulation. For example, generally, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription.
 
Annual DEA registration is required for any facility that manufactures, tests, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance or List I Chemical. Except for certain DEA defined co-incidental activities, each registration is specific to a particular location and activity. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration must specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and, thereafter, on a periodic basis. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include, among other things, background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as vaults, cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances and List I Chemicals, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or significant losses of any controlled substance and List I Chemicals, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance and List I Chemicals. In addition, special authorization, notification and permit requirements apply to imports and exports.
 
22

 

In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II and List I Chemicals. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accomplished using special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Each entity distributing controlled substances is responsible for monitoring the use of such products to identify and control diversion and misuse. Because Oxaydo Tablets are Schedule II they are subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much oxycodone active ingredient may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount of oxycodone that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We or our licensees must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substance and List I Chemicals. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our or our licensees’ quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete the manufacture or purchase of material required for clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our or our licensees’ quota for controlled substances or List I Chemicals could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, or interrupt commercial sales of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
 
The DEA also regulates Listed Chemicals, which are chemicals that may be susceptible to abuse, diversion, and use in the illicit manufacture of controlled substances. Some Listed Chemicals, including pseudoephedrine, are used in various prescription and OTC drug products. DEA and state laws and regulations impose extensive recordkeeping, security, distribution, and reporting requirements for companies that handle, manufacture, or distribute Listed Chemicals, including lawful drug products containing Listed Chemicals. In particular, OTC drug products containing certain Listed Chemicals, including pseudoephedrine, are required to be secured behind the pharmacy counter and dispensed to customers directly by a pharmacist only in limited quantities. Pharmacists must obtain proof of identity from customers, and must keep detailed records and make reports to the DEA regarding sales of such products. Individual states may, and in some cases have, imposed stricter requirements on the sale of drug products containing Listed Chemicals, including requiring a doctor’s prescription prior to dispensing such products to a customer.
 
The DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances and Listed Chemicals. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
 
Individual states also regulate controlled substances and List I Chemicals, and we or our licensees are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and future distribution of these products.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers at the federal, state and private levels. Government payer programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed care plans may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy is not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The United States Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.
 
For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other cost containment measures, the Healthcare Reform Law establishes:
 

· | An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the “donut hole”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23

 

Many of the Healthcare Reform Law’s most significant reforms were implemented in 2014, with others thereafter, and their details will be shaped significantly by implementing regulations, some of which have yet to be finalized. If such reforms result in an increase in the proportion of uninsured patients who are prescribed products resulting from our proprietary or partnered programs, this could adversely impact future sales of our products and our business and results of operations. Where patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the Healthcare Reform Law, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on that resulting drug utilization, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues. In addition, the Administration has also announced delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Healthcare Reform Law. The implications of these delays for our sales, business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear.
 
Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under government programs, and may also increase our or our licensees’ regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products.
 
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. In addition to the Healthcare Reform Law, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payers to keep healthcare costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Economic pressure on state budgets may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Managed care organizations continue to seek price discounts and, in some cases, to impose restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products. Certain of these changes could limit the prices that can be charged for drugs we develop or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or third-party payers, or may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies, or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to products we are able to commercialize. In short, our or our licensees’ results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Healthcare Reform Law, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Healthcare Reform Law in the future. The Trump administration and members of the U.S. Congress have indicated that they may continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Healthcare Reform Law. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition. In addition, we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance and review and approval of marketing applications. Notably, on January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order, applicable to all executive agencies, including the FDA, which requires that for each notice of proposed rulemaking or final regulation to be issued in fiscal year 2017, the agency shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed, unless prohibited by law. These requirements are referred to as the “two-for-one” provisions. This Executive Order includes a budget neutrality provision that requires the total incremental cost of all new regulations in the 2017 fiscal year, including repealed regulations, to be no greater than zero, except in limited circumstances. For fiscal years 2018 and beyond, the Executive Order requires agencies to identify regulations to offset any incremental cost of a new regulation and approximate the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. In interim guidance issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, on February 2, 2017, the administration indicates that the “two-for-one” provisions may apply not only to agency regulations, but also to significant agency guidance documents. In addition, on February 24, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing each affected agency to designate an agency official as a “Regulatory Reform Officer” and establish a “Regulatory Reform Task Force” to implement the two-for-one provisions and other previously issued executive orders relating to the review of federal regulations, however it is difficult to predict how these requirements will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA’s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on the FDA’s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.
 
24

 

In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that an adequate level of coverage or payment will be available so that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 
We and our licensees that commercialize our products are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Health Care Reform Law, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Healthcare Reform Law also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. The civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. Violations of these laws or any other federal or state fraud and abuse laws may subject our licensees to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, which could harm the commercial success of our products and materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Human Capital Management
 
We have 12 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee, 9 of whom are engaged in the research, development and manufacture of product candidates utilizing our proprietary Aversion, Impede, and LIMITx Technologies. The remaining employees are engaged in administrative, legal, accounting, finance, market research, and business development activities. All of our senior management and most of our other employees have prior experience in pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. We strive to maintain a safe, healthy and respectful workplace. We offer competitive compensation coupled with attractive health benefits. The average tenure of our employees is approximately 20 years. Since 2018, two employees have separated from the Company and neither were replaced. We believe engaging experienced pharmaceutical scientists in our Culver, IN facility could be difficult given its less populated geography and lack of other pharmaceutical companies in the immediate area.
 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the primary responsibility of overseeing our human capital management activities (including assessing the effectiveness of employee programs and advising management with regard to the quality of the workforce to carry out our strategic goals and overall human resource strategies). Within management, our Human Resources function has management responsibility for advising and assisting the business on human resource matters and executing our overall human capital management strategies. We have had no turnover in our Board since 2018.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly implemented safety and health standards and protocols, including social distancing, limiting density, reporting and documenting exposures and providing for working from home as appropriate, all as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control or mandated by local regulations.
 
We have an ethics policy in place which is sent to all employees annually which encourages communication of any matter of concern to the Board of Directors through a process delineated in the ethics policy.
