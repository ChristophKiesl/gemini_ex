Company Overview
We are one of the largest providers of surface transportation and logistics solutions in North America. Schneider National, Inc. is a publicly held holding company that, together with our wholly owned subsidiaries, provides safe, reliable, and innovative truckload, intermodal, and logistics services to a diverse group of customers throughout the continental United States, Canada, and Mexico. Unless otherwise indicated by the context, “we,” “us,” “our,” “ours,” the “Company,” and “Schneider” refer to Schneider National, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We were founded in 1935 and have been a publicly held company since our initial public offering in 2017. Our stock is publicly traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol SNDR and is included in the Russell 1000 Index. Schneider possesses an array of capabilities and resources that leverage artificial intelligence, data science, and analytics to provide innovative solutions that coordinate the movement of products timely, safely, and effectively, thus adding value to our customers’ supply chains. 
Our diversified portfolio of complementary service offerings combines truckload services with intermodal and logistics offerings, enabling us to serve our customers’ varied needs. Our service offerings include transportation of full-truckload freight, which we directly transport utilizing either our company-controlled revenue equipment and company drivers or owner-operators under contract with us. We have arrangements with most of the major North American rail carriers to transport freight in containers. We also provide customized freight movement, revenue equipment, labor, systems, and delivery services tailored to meet individual customer requirements and typically involve long-term contracts. These arrangements are generally referred to as dedicated services and may include multiple pickups and drops, local deliveries, freight handling, specialized equipment, and freight network design. We also provide comprehensive logistics services with a network of thousands of reliable third-party carriers, and through a China-based subsidiary, we offer limited transportation and logistics services in China which consist primarily of brokerage services. We categorize our operations into the following reportable segments:
•Truckload – which consists of freight transported and delivered by our company-employed drivers in company trucks and by owner-operators. These services are executed through either network (formerly called for-hire) or dedicated contracts and include standard long-haul and regional shipping services primarily using dry van, bulk, temperature-controlled, and flat-bed equipment, as well as cross dock and customized solutions for high-value and time-sensitive loads with coverage throughout North America.
•Intermodal – which consists of door-to-door container on flat car (“COFC”) service through a combination of rail and dray transportation, in association with our rail carrier providers. Our intermodal service uses company-owned containers, chassis, and trucks with primarily company dray drivers, augmented by third-party dray capacity.
•Logistics – which consists of freight brokerage (including Power Only which leverages our nationwide trailer pools to match capacity with demand), supply chain (including 3PL), warehousing, and import/export services. Our logistics business provides value-added services using both our assets and third-party capacity, augmented by our trailing assets, to manage and move our customers’ freight. 
Our business is seasonal across each of our segments which generally translates to our reported revenues being the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter.
For more information on our reportable segments, see Note 15, Segment Reporting.
We also lease equipment to third parties through our wholly owned subsidiary Schneider Finance, Inc., which is primarily engaged in leasing trucks to owner-operators, including, but not limited to, owner-operators with whom we contract. Additionally, we provide insurance for both company drivers and owner-operators through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary.
Our Mission and Strategy
We are driven by our uncompromising values to safely deliver the goods that enhance the lives of people everywhere. We forge long-term relationships with key customers as an integral partner in, and extension of, their supply chains. Our strategy is based on delivering superior experiences to our customers utilizing an integrated, multimodal approach to provide capacity-oriented 
solutions centered on delivering customer value and industry-leading service. We believe our operating strategy adds value to customers, fuels our earnings, and generates returns to stockholders. We continually analyze opportunities for capital investment and effective capital deployment to provide more benefits to our customers and increase returns to our shareholders. Business DevelopmentsCOVID-19With the uncertainties of COVID-19, the Company continues to monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business, including the impact to its customers, associates, owner-operators, and business partners. Our operational and financial performance were negatively impacted by a reduction in volumes across our Truckload and Intermodal segments primarily during the second quarter of 2020, however we experienced improvement as the year progressed. Cost reduction initiatives implemented by the Company lessened the impact of reduced volumes, but uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition and future results of operations.
Industry and Competition
Truckload
The trucking industry is at the core of the U.S. economy and moves the vast majority of freight volume in the U.S. Overall, it is a highly competitive and fragmented industry, characterized by many small carriers. Increased regulations and initiatives to improve the safety and reduce emissions of the U.S. trucking industry have impacted industry dynamics in recent years and are discussed in the Regulation section below. Our Truckload segment competes with thousands of dry van and specialty equipment carriers. While we compete with many smaller carriers on a regional basis, only a limited number of carriers represent competition in all markets across North America.
Intermodal
The domestic intermodal segment is highly consolidated, where the top three intermodal providers, including our Intermodal segment, operate a significant portion of the U.S. domestic container fleet. Our Intermodal segment competes with intermodal providers and other transportation service companies.
Logistics
The logistics industry is a large, fast-growing, and fragmented market that represents an integral part of the global economy. Transportation asset owners often provide logistics services to meet excess demand and provide customers with greater breadth of services which results in our Logistics segment competing with other logistics companies and brokerage businesses, and to a lesser extent other truckload carriers.
Customers 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we offered our services to approximately 9,250 customers across our portfolio, including nearly 200 Fortune 500 companies, and 24 of our top 25 customers used services from all three of our reportable segments. Our Logistics segment manages over 36,000 qualified carrier relationships and managed approximately $1.9 billion of third-party freight in 2020. 
Our broad portfolio helps limit customer and industry concentration. We receive revenue from a diversified customer base, none of which generated revenues in excess of 10% in 2020. We maintain a broad end-market footprint, encompassing over ten distinct industries including general merchandise, chemicals, electronics and appliances, and food and beverage, among others. Our diversified revenue mix and customer base allows for revenue and yield management stability throughout the year, despite the fact that many of our customers are affected by seasonal fluctuations.
Revenue Equipment 
Our company owned revenue equipment fleet was comprised of the following at December 31, 2020:

Revenue Equipment Type | Approximate Number of Units
Over-the-road sleeper cab tractors | 7,200 
Day cab tractors | 1,700 
Other tractors (yard tractors, straight trucks, and training tractors) | 100 
Trailers | 36,900 
Containers | 22,300 
Chassis | 20,600 

Human Capital Matters
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 15,225 associates, 66% of whom are drivers with the remaining 34% consisting of mechanics and warehouse personnel, managers, and other corporate office employees. Approximately 17% of our associates are based at our headquarters in Green Bay, Wisconsin. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our associate relations to be good. Currently, seven of our company drivers are members of an organized labor union, as a result of a commitment we made in the 1980s to allow this group of drivers to finish their careers at Schneider while remaining union members. None of our other associates are represented by a labor union.
As a result of our performance, integrity, and collaborative culture, we have a highly engaged workforce. Our workforce is deployed over a diverse set of positions across our segments, geographies, and businesses. Where consistent with our operational needs, we offer a variety of flexible working arrangements to associates, which include remote work arrangements.
As a result of retirements, high turnover rates, and the slow pace of attracting new drivers to the industry, the industry and the long-haul truckload sector, in particular, have been characterized by persistent shortages of truck drivers. Recognizing the indispensable role that our truck drivers play in our ability to serve our customers, making our driver experience the best in the industry and retaining our drivers is a high priority. We employ a number of measures to offset driver turnover, remain focused on driver retention, and maintain a turnover rate which is generally consistent with the industry standard. Those measures include establishing monthly hiring targets, offering drivers competitive salaries and benefits, establishing driver pay scales which provide for increasing pay by experience level and performance, offering both live and remote driver training by experienced driving instructors, maintaining a modern truck fleet with the latest safety technology, and improving the overall driver experience.
We conduct biennial associate surveys to measure associate satisfaction and garner ideas to improve workforce engagement. Survey results are used to implement programs that will enhance associate connectivity with the Company which is believed to lead to increased innovation, productivity, and profitability.
The Company believes that a diverse workforce leads to innovative ideas and a culture that drives unique and inclusive perspectives. We promote an environment where respect for others and their rights are expected.
Owner-Operators
In addition to the company drivers we employ, we enter into contracts with independent contractors who operate as “owner-operators”. Owner-operators are small business owners who operate their own trucks (some may employ drivers they hire) and provide us with services under a contractual arrangement whereby they are generally responsible for the costs of truck ownership and operating expenses. Owner-operators select their own load assignments, have control over their schedule, and are compensated on a per load basis. Owner-operators tend to be experienced drivers and represented approximately 22% of driver capacity as of December 31, 2020.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
We prioritize doing business responsibly and embrace that we have a role to play in the betterment of society. At Schneider, we define sustainability broadly as safe and responsible practices that strengthen the economy and create a safer world. We seek to accomplish this by maintaining a modern fleet to maximize fuel efficiency, leveraging our intermodal service to convert loads from truck to rail, consolidating freight whenever possible, and introducing technologies to coordinate the movement of 
products timely, safely, and efficiently. Additionally, we continue to evaluate alternative fuel vehicles, and our efforts to improve overall fleet fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions are ongoing. We are an EPA SmartWay® Transport Partner and are proud to be one of only four freight carriers to receive the EPA’s SmartWay® Excellence Award each year since the award was created. We were the first company to receive the National Safety Council’s Green Cross for Safety Award for two consecutive years. As always, we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and strive to conduct all of our operations as safely as possible.
Safety 
“Safety first and always” is a Schneider core value. We believe we have a responsibility to our associates, customers, and the community to operate safely. Our safety culture is built on five key components:
•Driver hiring and drug testing. We hire both experienced drivers and drivers new to the industry through a comprehensive hiring process. As part of that process, we voluntarily choose to use hair follicle testing in addition to mandated urine-based drug testing. While costing more per driver, hair follicle testing is generally more accurate than urine-based testing.
•Military drivers. We have a strong relationship with the U.S. military and employ many drivers with military experience. This experience produces quality truck drivers due to the discipline instilled through military training programs. 
•Training. Initial training is complemented by regularly scheduled follow-up training to sustain and enhance basic skills. We operate company-sponsored driver training facilities and have invested in simulators for both initial and sustainment training.
•Equipment and technology. We invest in trucks that are configured with roll stability, collision mitigation, lane departure warning, and forward-facing cameras. Driving behavior is electronically monitored, alerts are provided to the driver situationally, and performance is documented for subsequent coaching. We also employ electronic logging, which ensures HOS compliance and reduces fatigue occurrences.
•Active management. Driver leaders and safety coordinators have real-time access to activity in the truck, facilitating situational and scheduled coaching. We have invested in predictive analytics that assist in proactively identifying drivers with potential safety issues and recommending a remediation path. 
Truckload carriers share safety performance information in monitored peer-to-peer forums. We have always maintained a satisfactory DOT safety rating, which is the highest available rating.
Fuel
We actively manage our fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies. In 2020, we made 99% of our fuel purchases through negotiated volume purchase discounts. We store fuel in underground storage tanks at ten locations and in above-ground storage tanks at one location. We believe that we are in substantive compliance with applicable environmental laws relating to the storage of fuel.
In response to fluctuations in fuel prices, we use surcharge programs to adjust fuel costs charged to our customers. We believe the most cost-effective protection against variability in fuel costs is to continue the fuel surcharge programs and invest in a fuel-efficient fleet. However, fuel surcharges may not adequately cover potential future increases in fuel prices. As an additional measure, we leverage fuel consumption metrics in evaluating drivers’ performance, and drivers utilize a fuel optimizer program where they purchase fuel at the most cost-effective locations based on distance to empty and fuel purchase commitments. 
Regulation
Industry Regulation
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various agencies in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Our company drivers and owner-operators must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and HOS. Weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to government regulations. Other agencies, such as the EPA and Department of Homeland Security, also regulate equipment. We believe regulation in the transportation industry may become progressively more restrictive and complex. The following discussion presents recently enacted federal, state, and local regulations that have an impact on our operations.
Hours of Service
We are subject to the FMCSA’s HOS rule, which was effective on July 1, 2013.
ELDs
The FMCSA issued its final rule mandating the use of ELDs in December 2015. Under the rule, carriers were required to adopt and use compliant devices beginning in December 2017. In December 2019, the next phase of the ELD mandate went into effect requiring carriers previously grandfathered-in for the use of automatic on-board recording devices to switch to ELDs for logging HOS.
Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse
The FMCSA issued its final rule establishing the Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse (“Clearinghouse”) in 2016 (effective date January 4, 2017). Compliance was required by January 6, 2020. The Clearinghouse requires FMCSA-regulated employers and others to report information related to violations of the drug and alcohol regulation for current and prospective driver employees. It also requires the employers to query the Clearinghouse (a) for current/prospective employees before allowing them to operate a commercial motor vehicle on public roads and (b) for current employees, at least annually for each driver.
Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers
The Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers rule, as adopted by the FMCSA, explicitly prohibits motor carriers and other parties in the supply chain from coercing drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations, including, but not limited to, driver HOS limits, commercial drivers’ license regulations, drug and alcohol testing rules, and hazardous materials regulations. Under the rule, drivers can report incidents of coercion to the FMCSA, which is authorized to issue penalties against the offending party.
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine idling, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risk. We maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at some of our terminals. We also have vehicle maintenance and repair operations at some of our facilities. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage and seepage, discharge of contaminants, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws. As part of our safety and risk management program, we periodically perform environmental reviews. We are a partner in the EPA’s SmartWay Transport Partnership, a voluntary program promoting energy efficiency and air quality. 
In 2008, the State of California’s ARB approved the Heavy-Duty Vehicle GHG Emission Reduction Regulation in efforts to reduce GHG emissions from certain long-haul tractor-trailers that operate in California by requiring them to use technologies that improve fuel efficiency (regardless of where the vehicle is registered). The regulation required owners of long-haul tractors and 53-foot trailers to replace or retrofit their vehicles with aerodynamic technologies and low rolling resistance tires. The regulation also contained certain emissions and registration standards for temperature-controlled trailer operators.
Thereafter, the EPA and the NHTSA began taking coordinated steps at a national level in support of a new generation of clean vehicles and engines through reduced GHG emissions and improved fuel efficiency. In September 2011, the EPA finalized federal regulations for controlling GHG emissions, beginning with model year 2014 medium and heavy-duty engines and vehicles and increasing in stringency through model year 2018 and later. The federal regulations relate to efficient engines, use of auxiliary power units, mass reduction, low rolling resistance tires, improved aerodynamics, improved transmissions, and reduced accessory loads.
In December 2013, California’s ARB approved regulations to align its GHG emission standards and test procedures, as well as its tractor-trailer GHG regulation, with the federal Phase 1 GHG regulation, which applied fuel efficiency standards to vehicles for model years 2014 to 2018 and later. 
In October 2016, the EPA and the NHTSA published a Final Rule for Phase 2 of the GHG emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy-duty engines and vehicles. The Final Rule, which became effective as of December 27, 2016, 
is expected to lower CO2 emissions by 1.1 billion metric tons and reduce oil consumption by up to 2 billion barrels over the lifetime of vehicles sold under the Phase 2 program. First-time CO2 and fuel consumption standards for combination tractors and engines (which are subject to individual and separate regulatory requirements) commence in calendar year 2021, increase incrementally in 2024, and achieve a fully phased-in requirement in 2027. EPA and NHTSA expect that motor carriers will meet the increased standards using technology improvements in multiple areas, including the engine, transmission, driveline, aerodynamic design, extended idle reduction technologies, and the use of other accessories.
Since its adoption of the Phase 2 Final Rule, the EPA has received various petitions for reconsideration based on the position that the EPA lacked legal authority to regulate certain types of vehicles, including glider vehicles and trailers. In light of these petitions, the EPA decided to revisit certain provisions in the Phase 2 Final Rule. In November 2017, the EPA issued a proposal to repeal the emissions standards and other requirements for heavy-duty glider vehicles, glider engines, and glider kits based upon a proposed interpretation of the CAA under which glider vehicles would be found not to constitute “new motor vehicles” within the meaning of CAA Section 216(3), glider engines would be found not to constitute “new motor vehicle engines” within the meaning of CAA Section 216(3), and glider kits would not be treated as “incomplete” new motor vehicles. Under this proposal interpretation, the EPA would lack authority to regulate glider vehicles, glider engines, and glider kits under CAA Section 202(a)(1). The public comment period for this proposal expired on January 5, 2018, and the EPA has not taken further action on the proposed rule.
Current and proposed GHG regulations could impact us by increasing the cost of new trucks, impairing productivity, and increasing our operating expenses.
Federal and state lawmakers are considering a variety of climate-change proposals related to carbon and GHG emissions. The proposals could potentially limit carbon emissions for certain states and municipalities, which continue to restrict the location and amount of time that diesel-powered trucks may idle.
AB 5
In September 2019, California passed California Assembly Bill 5, more commonly referred to as “AB 5”, which codifies the standard known as the “ABC test” in order to determine whether a worker is considered an independent contractor or an employee for purposes of employee benefits such as sick leave, paid vacation, and overtime, among other legal requirements. Observers generally view AB 5 as lowering the threshold for classifying a worker as an employee as opposed to an independent contractor. AB 5 was scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2020; however, a California Federal District judge has issued a preliminary injunction enjoining California from enforcing AB 5 as to motor carriers while the case is pending. This decision was appealed and a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on September 2, 2020. If AB 5 is upheld, capacity and rates throughout the industry could be widely impacted.
Technology
Our in-cab telematics platform delivers on-board technology through our private application store to enable regulatory compliance and driver productivity needs. This comprehensive platform includes message capabilities, applications that scan and automate paperwork, and customer and location specific step-by-step work assignments. Our telematics platform is fully integrated with our back-office planning and execution systems and delivers real-time data in our business. Trailer and container fleets are equipped with monitoring devices which function both when tethered to a tractor or standing alone. Our tractors are equipped with stability control and collision mitigation technology, lane departure warning, and forward-facing cameras. All tractor technology interfaces with the in-cab device and provides the driver and the driver’s leader with real-time performance data.
Our business is executed through an integrated technology platform that encompasses an end-to-end process design which focuses on information accessibility across our value chain. Our platform enables an integrated approach to cash processing including load/order acceptance based on driver and network optimization, vehicle dispatch, continuous quote monitoring, and visibility to the load from pick-up to delivery and customer collection. Proprietary decision support tools are embedded throughout the platform and assist our associates in making the right trade-offs among drivers’ needs for earnings and work-life balance, customers’ needs for reliable capacity and service, and our business and its shareholders’ needs for an adequate return. Decision support tools improve our ability to, among other things, situationally coach drivers, minimize fuel costs, and maintain the fleet in the most cost-effective manner. 
We continue to expand our business capabilities by extending our foundational Quest platform and making advancements to our in-cab technology. We are also leveraging mobile applications to better connect with company drivers and customers. One example is a mobile application that prompts our company drivers to rate the shipping, receiving, and driver support locations 
that they visit. Our gathering and sharing of this information with customers and providers have been well received and are driving action to improve the drivers' experience. Schneider FreightPower® digitally connects the benefits of Quest with the strength of our trailer network and carrier relationships to service our customers.
