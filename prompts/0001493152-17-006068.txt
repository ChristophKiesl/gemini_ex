Item 1. Business.
Our Company
 
International Western Petroleum, Inc. (“IWP” or the “Company”) was incorporated on February 19, 2014 as a Nevada corporation and is based in Irving, Texas. The Company was formed to conduct operations in the oil and gas industry. We are an oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas. On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired significant working interests from the Bend Arch Lion 1A and the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Ventures in Coleman County of Texas, encompassing a total production of 7 producing oil and gas wells on a total 380 acres out of 777 acre leaseholds showing proven recoverable reserves of approximately 416.34 Mbbl and 317.45 MMcf as of March 1, 2017. In fiscal year 2017, the Company, together with its affiliated operator; International Western Oil Corporation (IWO), have completed drilling an additional 3 oil and gas wells, thus totaling 10 gross wells in production in the Midland area. It is noted that the Bend Arch Lion 1A and 1B Joint Ventures are parts of the total 777-acre leaseholds that have not been fully explored. The Company also manages the 45-acre Marshall Walden joint venture with 8 Woodbine Sand oil wells in Kilgore City, Texas and has recently acquired a 350-acre leasehold with 3 oil wells from the multi-zone Ratliff property in King County, thus setting our foothold in the Eastern Permian Basin of Texas. Currently, IWO holds approximately 2,400 acres in leaseholds in the Central West Texas region. The Company plans to acquire additional leaseholds from IWO and other oil and gas operators in the future.
 
The Company is continually seeking strategic investors to help it develop additional exploration and acquisition projects located within the Bend Arch-Fort Worth Basin as well as other prime acquisition targets in the Central West, South and East Texas. As such, the Company is working on obtaining enough funding to provide a budget for new acquisitions in the remaining calendar year as well as new exploration projects in 2018 to meet its financial objectives during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2018.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We are an E&P (Exploration & Production) oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas. The Company is currently managed by business and oil and gas exploration veterans who specialize in the oil and gas acquisition and exploration markets of the Central West Texas region. The Company’s goal is to tap into the high potential leases of the Central West Texas region of the United States, aiming to unlock its potential, specifically in the prolific Bend Arch-Fort Worth region. This area is approximately 120 miles long and 40 miles wide running from Archer County, Texas in the north to Brown County, Texas in the south. The Company is also looking at other lucrative acquisition opportunities in Permian Basin, West Texas, East Texas and South Texas region.
 
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Ross Henry Ramsey, and his family have participated in a number of exploration projects with several major oil and gas companies. Management believes that state-of the-art technology is one of the key differentiators of the Company. Oil and natural gas reserve development is a highly technologically oriented industry. Management believes that the use of leading edge technology has greatly increased the success rate of finding commercial oil or natural gas deposits. In this context, success rate means the ability to make an oil/gas well that can produce a commercialized quantity of hydrocarbons. In general, the Company expects to conduct additional 3D Seismic survey to determine more accurate drilling locations and drilling depths beside its initial georadiometry technology application via its last 10 drilling projects. For short-term cash flow enhancement, the Company plans to seek large-reserve oil and gas properties with low production to acquire at the lowest cost possible and then implement effective Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”) methods to improve its current revenues and assets. For long-term cash flow enhancement, the Company plans to identify larger and more mature production opportunities while selecting capital partners to buyout via the Company’s strategic joint venture partnerships thus significantly increasing productions via additional drillings and state-of-the-art EOR implementations.
 
The Company’s long-term objective is to increase shareholder value by growing reserves, production and cash flow. To accomplish this objective, we plan to execute the following business strategies:
 
Develop and Grow Our Hydrocarbon Rich Resource-Style Acreage Positions Using Our Proven Development Expertise. We plan to continue to acquire high quality assets in hydrocarbon-rich resource plays to improve our asset quality and expand our drilling inventory. We plan to leverage our management team’s expertise and apply the latest available Enhanced Oil Recovery technologies to economically develop our existing property portfolio in Central West and East Texas in addition to any assets in other regions we may acquire. We operate the majority of our acreage, thus giving us certain control over the planning of capital expenditures, execution and cost reduction. Our carefully planned operation also allows us to adjust our capital spending based on drilling results and the economic environment. Our leasehold acquisition strategy is to pursue long-term contracts that allow us to maintain flexible development plans and avoid short-term obligations to drill wells, as have been common in other resource plays. As a small producer, we regionally evaluate industry drilling results and implement technologically effective operating practices which may increase our initial production rates, ultimate recovery factors and rate of return on invested capital.

Manage Our Property Portfolio Proactively. We constantly evaluate our properties to identify and divest non-core assets and higher cost or lower volume producing properties with limited developmental potential, thus enabling us to focus on a portfolio of core properties with the greatest economic potential to increase our proved reserves and production.
 
Acquire Small Producing Companies with Compelling Underlying Values. We identify acquisition opportunities of exploration and production companies with underlying assets to unlock the development potential and accelerate production using new technologies and capital infusion from capital partners.
 
Maintain Good Balance Sheet and Execute Growth Plan. Our management team is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, aiming to provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our growth in assets and revenues.
 
Our operation strategy is to identify “prime time” hydrocarbon land leases in Texas with in-depth studies and develop proven reserves via drilling new wells and re-entering existing low production wells to maximize production and enhance valuation of our production assets. We also plan to position the Company in the international marketplace as a petroleum expert in the United States to partner up with multinational oil and gas players after establishing our new presence in the Permian Basin of Texas and applying state-of-the-art exploration technology on our new leases.
 
Based upon management’s petroleum exploration experience as well as its geology expertise and its ability to identify high potential acreage and high production fields, management believes that the Company’s near future valuation as a public company is attractive.
 
Our immediate revenue strategy today is to acquire existing production with large reserves and unlock their full potential by new enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”) methods and drilling new wells to be hand-picked by management. We are at full speed to acquire and develop more reserves to increase and create enduring value for our company.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
Management believes that we have a number of competitive strengths that will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies:
 
Simple Capital Structure. It is the time for a company like us with simple capital structure and de-risked inventory of quality locations with upside potential to take advantage of the current low oil prices to acquire high potential productions at low cost. Management believes there are opportunities for profits to be made once oil prices start moving up.
 
Visionary Management Team. With significant experience in all aspects of the development of resource plays, our management team include4th generation oil men, geologists, engineers with business skills that have decades of combined experience in the industry and a commitment of creating shareholder value via acquisition strategies.
 
Low Risk Exploration Practice. Unlike many major oil companies that often drill very deep wells with a high degree of risk, we are a specialist in shallow well exploration (sub 5,000 feet) that is less expensive and has lower risk factors. The basis for management’s belief that the wells that can be drilled in the prospective leases will have the capacity to produce a reasonable amount of hydrocarbon and due to our recent studies of the general areas where we are prospecting the projects. That is our most important exploration practice.
 
Under The Radar Asset Base. Management believes our local West Texan E&P team has a special talent in acquiring local “prime time” hydrocarbon land leases with sub-300 bopd (barrels of oil per day) wells that have large hydrocarbon reserves. Management believes that these “under the radar” prospective leases have multi-year drilling inventory and reasonable production history with high upside potential and not readily accessible to public for auctions, thus adding to our competitive advantage on these “under the radar” opportunities. It is because management also believes that these highly valuable leases are not economically justifiable for the major oil and gas companies in the region because such companies need the wells they drill to produce at least 300 Bbls (barrels) of oil per day per well.

Geographic Diversity. We believe that our geographic diversity encompassing the West, Central West, East and South Texas regions provides us with broad flexibility to direct our capital resources to projects with the greatest potential returns and access to multiple key end markets, which mitigates our exposure to temporary price dislocations in any one market.
 
Strong Technical Team. Our technical team has significant experience and expertise in applying the most sophisticated technologies used in conventional and unconventional resource style plays, including 3-D seismic interpretation, vertical and horizontal drilling, comprehensive multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulation programs, other oilfield service, and enhanced oil recovery technologies. We believe this technical expertise is partly responsible for our management team’s strong track record of successful exploration and development, including defining core producing areas in emerging plays.
 
Technologies
 
Management believes that technology is one of the key differentiators of the Company. Oil and natural gas reserve development is a highly technologically oriented industry; many techniques developed by the industry are now used in other industries, including the space program. Management believes that technological innovations have made it possible for the oil and natural gas industry to furnish the fuels that power the world economy. Management also believes that technology has greatly increased the success rate of finding commercial oil or natural gas deposits. In this context, success rate means the ability to make an oil/gas well that can produce a commercialized quantity of hydrocarbon.
Georadiometry
 
The use of 3-D Hydrocarbon Imaging brought georadiometric technology into the cutting edge of identifying and quantifying oil reservoirs and reserves with sophisticated field equipment and software integration abilities that aided explorers in locating oil and gas leasehold reserves. All specific drilling recommendations and opinions are based upon the technical results of inferences from global positioning satellites, electrical, and gamma ray devices and calibrated measurements based on georadiometric technology. 3-D Hydrocarbon Imaging rivals conventional seismic and downhole logging for reserve identification. This technology goes beyond conventional techniques in both arenas of cost and reserve identification and has been leveraged to meet the needs of the industry. 3-D Hydrocarbon Imaging has taken historical radiometric technology to a more complete and reliable level today. Historical documentation of radiometric’s success ratio and interpretation average above 90% in its accuracy. To date, this radiometry technology has demonstrated that it has clearly improved on this with its thoroughness in gathering field data and applying its sophisticated computer modeling and interpretation.
Hydrocarbon Satellite Imaging
 
Hydrocarbon survey maps are generated from several data sources downloaded from scientific instruments installed on Earth orbit satellites. These instruments are designed to retrieve physical data from outer space as well as from the Earth. Instruments installed on the satellites include, for our use, Radar, Infrared (Temperature), Radiation (Radiometrics), Dialectic Potential (Tellurics), Ionization, and Geo-Magnetics. These data sets are stacked and embedded into each data stream that result in the final map interpretation. All of these exploration techniques can be done separately with land based tools but with the use of satellites it is possible to cover much larger areas more economically.
Directional Drilling
 
Drilling technology has come a long way over the years. Among the most recent advancements in drilling are Rotary Steerable tools which allow three-dimensional control of the bit without stopping the drill string. One of the benefits of this technology is increasing the exposed section throughout the target reservoir by drilling through it at an angle. Directional drilling also allows drilling into reservoirs where vertical access is difficult or not possible; for instance, an oilfield under a town, lake, or hard to drill through formation.
Fracturing Technology
 
Fracturing technology allows the industry to get more oil or natural gas out of each deposit that it finds. Newer stimulation technologies, completion treatment fluids, and enhanced recovery techniques enable the oil or natural gas to move more easily to producing well bores. Hydraulic fracturing techniques create small cracks from the well bore into the reservoir rock. A “propant” (usually sand), is then pumped into the formation to keep the fractures open. These fractures serve as a “highway” for the hydrocarbons to be produced. Horizontal-drilling technologies allow the reservoir to be penetrated horizontally rather than vertically, opening more of the reservoir to the well bore and enhancing recovery. “Acidizing”, is another stimulation technique that is frequently used in carbonate (limestone, dolomite) reservoirs to increase porosity, permeability and to enhance recovery. Sometimes the techniques of fracturing and acidizing are combined in an “acid-frac job” resulting in increased production. Secondary and tertiary recovery techniques can include “water flood” which utilizes water injection wells to push oil from partially depleted reservoirs to recovery wells. CO2 injection wells pressure up the depleted reservoir for the same purpose of increasing production.

At IWP, we have a passion for Geoscience while understanding complex mineralogy in shale reservoirs and better determining zones prone to fracture stimulation. This technology knows where to frack by providing us with rapid loads of massive data while delivering game changing levels of collaboration: multi-well, multi-user and multi interpreter. Our field engineers, geologists and petrophysicists work together for better drilling decisions.
 
“Green” Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Technology
 
With billions of barrels of oil remain untapped around the world, the Company has recently identified a proven EOR technology that has been applied to diverse environments in over 40 oil fields in 4 continents with 92% average increase in mature productions in over 300 well applications. This proprietary technology produces environmentally safe, consistent and repeatable results, thus increasing cash flow, oil reserves, and property value.
Reservoir Estimate
 
The Company owns working interests of the 2 production joint ventures in the Bend Arch-Fort Worth region of Texas. The Bend Arch is a prolific structure that, management believes, still contains a vast amount of commercial hydrocarbons. This structure has yielded a large amount of commercial revenue from hydrocarbon recovery for over 80 years. Management believes that a study of the history of prospecting for oil and gas in the Bend Arch reveals that a treasure trove of oil and gas reserves still exist.
 
As of March 1, 2017, our estimated gross proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm, Ralph E. Davis, an Opportune Company, using SEC prices of $43.05 per Bbl of oil and $1.55 per Mcf of natural gas, were 416.34MBbl of oil and 317.45MMcf of natural gas. Approximately 41.5% of our oil reserves and 36.3% of our natural gas reserves were classified as proved producing and proved behind pipe categories as of March 1, 2017.
 
The Bend Arch region has a history of wells producing oil and gas for 40 to 60 years at, management believes, an attractive commercial rate in primary production mode, secondary recovery mode, and even tertiary recovery mode with, management believes, time on our side which means modern technology will become more advanced in the future.
 
Sales Strategy
 
Abilene, Texas is the closest city with oil handling and sales firms. Our sales strategy in relation to spot pricing will be to produce less when the sales price is lower and produce more when the sales price is higher. To maintain the lowest production cost, we will aim to have our inventory be virtually zero. Our E&P core team has business relationships with BML, Transport Oil, Lion Oil Trading & Transportation, for oil sales as well as WTG Jameson for gas sales. The Company has selected to enter into material agreements with BML, Lion Oil and WTG Jameson so that, as our tier 1 buyer, they can handle pick-up and sales of our crude oil stock to refineries and gas via local gas pipelines.
 
As such, crude oil will be picked up from our leases as needed during the calendar month. At the end of the month the crude total sales will be tallied by lease and the 30-day average of the daily closing of oil will be tabulated. On or about the 25th of the following month the proceeds checks will be issued to the financial parties of record.
 
Operational Plans
 
During fiscal year 2017, the Company was actively looking for large-reserve oil and gas concessions with existing production to acquire and continue to raise enough capital via equity financing options to meet its operational goal in fiscal year 2018.
 
Based on management’s general management and petroleum exploration experience as well as its geology expertise, the Company believes in its ability to identify high potential acreages and high production fields.
 
The Company has recently shifted its E&P plan on regional acquisition(s) with a focus in the Permian Basin region. This region has been producing oil continuously for nearly 100 years and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has recently announced that this region is the largest estimate of continuous oil that it has ever assessed. Our area of interest is production locations within the Wolfcamp shale in the Midland Basin portion of the Texas Permian Basin where the USGS estimates that there are 20 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil.

The Company has instigated a new acquisition model which is based on:
 

a) | the financed acquisition of mature oil fields that have great potential for the application of an advanced Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) process. This process is a very cost effective EOR process which has been technologically field proven with great success in over 40 oil fields around the world, where the average production increase of producing wells, onshore and offshore, has been recorded with over 130% upside; and 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | strategic partnership with existing operators to share production increases garnered through the implementation of this EOR process. The Company’s management believes that it is well positioned to exploit a highly effective and developed EOR technology which uniquely addresses a global market of “trapped oil” estimated at $250 trillion U.S. dollars. The Company aims to execute its mission in this new direction to create high value for the benefit of its shareholders and strategic partners. 

 
Since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company has reviewed several good acquisition candidates in the West Permian Basin and South Texas. After identifying any new prospect, additional research and evaluation was carried out using our personal contacts, geologists, 3D seismic, satellite hydrocarbon imaging, production data and every available resource to glean information and data in order to make an acquisition decision. Our operational plan after each acquisition is to increase production of the acquired oil and gas properties using state-of-the-art production technologies with a designated budget pre-approved by the Company’s senior management team.
 
The Company has plans to design a cost effective operating budget for each exploration project associated with an acquisition project and each budget will vary depending on the total depth of drilling and whether it is a new drilling or a re-entry. For each project, the Company plans on hiring selected operators to work under the close supervision of a core team of Company geologists, engineers and scientists.
 
The exploration process is a 2-phase process: 1) drilling and testing and 2) well completion. The Company plans to hire drilling specialists and technical consultants designated to oversee the drilling for each well during the drilling and testing phase. For the well completion process, the Company plans to hire technical data collectors and cementing operators to ensure the best performance upon perforating the wells at different pay zones based on thorough technical advisory work done by our internal and external geologists before production.
 
The Company also has an immediate operational plan to apply selective leading edge Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”) technologies from technology vendors to improve existing production after each future acquisition.
 
To date, the Company has prospected and completed several exploration and acquisition projects:
 
Completed Acquisitions with Production Enhancement Programs
 
The Bend Arch Lion 1A JV, Coleman County, TX:
 
This drilling joint venture is a 160-acre leasehold having 4 producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating partner International Western Oil. This field has been surveyed with high quality proven reserves encompassing several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand, the Palo Pinto, and in some instances the Ellenburger pay zone. On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired a 39.5% working interest from International Western Oil Corporation (“IWO”) in the Bend Arch Lion 1A Joint Venture (the Pittard Bend Arch White property encompassing 160 acres – State ID# 21488) (the “1A Venture”.) By acquiring these working interests, the Company directly receives the share of working interest revenue (after accounting for applicable taxes, expenses, and landowner royalties) IWO was receiving prior to the acquisitions.
 
As of February 28, 2017, the 1A Venture property had four (4) gross oil and gas wells (1.58 net wells). The initial production of this property started in April 2014.
 
Management plans to execute its production improvement program on the Bend Arch Lion 1A as the result of our recent in-depth studies show accessible proven reserves in several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand pay zone, the Palo Pinto pay zone and the Ellenburger pay zone. Management believes, its production improvement program can offer a substantial increase from the current production of this field by re-completing certain Gray Sand pay zones with either standard acidizing jobs or a new EOR method and also entering virgin Palo Pinto pay zone or Ellenburger pay zone in certain declining wellbores.

The Bend Arch Lion 1B JV, Coleman County, TX:
 
This drilling joint venture is a 220-acre leasehold having 6 new producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating partner International Western Oil. In May 2015, the Company acquired working interests of this leasehold which has been surveyed with high quality proven reserves encompassing several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand and in some instances the Ellenburger pay zone. At the moment, the leasehold has 3 producing wells coming from the Gray Sand formation and 3 producing wells coming from the Ellenberger formation. On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired 50% working interest in the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Venture (the Pittard Bend Arch Red property encompassing 220 acres - State ID# 13121) (the “1B Venture”.)By acquiring these working interests, the Company directly receives the share of working interest revenue (after accounting for applicable taxes, expenses, and landowner royalties) IWO was receiving prior to the acquisitions.
 
As of February 28, 2017, the 1B Venture property had six (6) gross oil and gas wells (3 net wells). The initial production of this property started in March 2015.
 
Management plans to execute its production improvement program on the Bend Arch Lion 1B as the result of our recent in-depth studies showing accessible proven reserves in several pay zones highlighted by the Gray Sand pay zone and the Ellenburger pay zone. Management believes, can offer a substantial increase from the current production of this field by re-completing certain Gray Sand pay zone with either standard acidizing jobs or a new EOR method and also entering virgin Gray Sand pay zone or increasing pumping efficiency in the Ellenburger pay zone in certain declining wellbores.
 
The Marshall Walden JV, Kilgore City, TX:
 
As of July 29, 2016, the Company served as the managing venturer in a 45-acre joint venture with Odyssey Enterprises LLC which has financed the Marshall Walden joint venture for the lease purchase and optimization of wells located in Kilgore, Texas, in the heart of the Woodbine formation. There are 8 wellbores in the acquisition, with 4 currently in production and 4 inactive. The Company has recently completed the re-work of the inactive wellbores and plans to upgrade to a new pump set up to enhance oil production levels. Management believes that this Marshall Walden acquisition put a solid foundation in place for the Company in the East Texas region.
 
As of February 28, 2017, the Marshall Walden property had four (4) gross oil and gas wells (0.4 net wells) which are active. The initial production of this property started in September 2016.
 
The Ratliff Property, King County, TX:
 
As of December 6, 2016, the Company has acquired a 3D Seismic 350-acre leasehold in King County, Texas. This acquisition primarily includes 350-acre leasehold in King County, Texas with additional options to lease up to 800 acres of adjoining acreage with complete 3D seismic data. The 350-acre leasehold comes with an existing tank facility for the production of oil, natural gas, and water. There is also a full injection wellbore set in place that is fully equipped. There have been five (5) wellbores drilled on this lease dating back to the 1970s, and these previous wellbores ranged from 4800ft – 6200ft in total depth, with three (3) different prolific hydrocarbon formations.
 
Management believes that this acquisition has create a foothold for us in the Eastern Permian Basin. With in depth studying of the 3D seismic data, we believe there are up to eight (8) proven undeveloped locations (“PUDs”) throughout the lease’s acreage. Management also believes that the Company can best take full advantage of the complete 3D Seismic data available and should be able to drill wellbores in extremely accurate locations. The Company plans to drill a8,000ft pilot hole in order to obtain Ellenbuger pay zone samples and complete the Canyon Reef pay zone at 6,700ft on one wellbore and access a full log review to determine if there is a window to drill a horizontal leg. The Company also plans to turn on 3 wellbores that are producers via extended re-entry method.
 
As of February 28, 2017, the Ratliff property had three (3) gross oil and gas wells (3 net wells) which the management plans to perform re-entry works. The initial production of this property has not started yet.
