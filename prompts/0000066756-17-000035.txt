Six taconite facilities served by Minnesota Power make up approximately 79 percent of iron ore pellet capacity in the U.S. according to the 2014 Skillings North American Mining Directory. Sales to taconite customers and iron concentrate customers represented 3,906 million kWh, or 61 percent, of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2016. Taconite, an iron-bearing rock of relatively low iron content, is abundantly available in northern Minnesota and an important domestic source of raw material for the steel industry. Taconite processing plants use large quantities of electric power to grind the iron-bearing rock, and agglomerate and pelletize the iron particles into taconite pellets. Iron concentrate reclamation facilities also use large quantities of electricity to extract and process iron-bearing tailings left from previous mining operations to produce iron ore concentrate.
Minnesota Power’s taconite customers are capable of producing up to approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steel making facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles, appliances, pipe and tube products for the gas and oil industry, and in the construction industry. Historically, less than five percent of Minnesota taconite production is exported outside of North America. Minnesota Power also provides electric service to three iron concentrate facilities capable of producing up to approximately 4 million tons of iron concentrate per year. Iron concentrate is used in the production of taconite pellets. These iron concentrate facilities are owned in whole, or in part, by Magnetation and are not currently operating. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Outlook – Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load.)

There has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 71 percent of capacity in 2016 (71 percent in 2015; 77 percent in 2014). Many steel producers reduced production in 2015, citing higher levels of imports and lower prices. Some Minnesota taconite and iron concentrate producers reduced production in 2015 in response to declining U.S. steel production. There is a natural lag between U.S. steel consumption and Minnesota taconite production. The high level of imports and lower prices in 2015 continued to impact Minnesota taconite production in 2016. In 2015, petitions regarding unfairly traded cold rolled, hot rolled and corrosion-resistant steel products were filed by domestic steel producers with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission resulting in countervailing duty and antidumping investigations. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission made final affirmative determinations concluding the investigations. As a result of the affirmative determinations, cash deposits are collected on these products when imported from certain countries. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2016 annual imports for consumption of steel products were down approximately 15 percent compared to 2015 annual imports.
The following table reflects Minnesota Power’s taconite customers’ production levels for the past ten years:

* Preliminary data from the Minnesota Department of Revenue. 

Minnesota Power’s taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term demand changes or maintenance outages. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power’s taconite customers’ production would impact our annual earnings per share by approximately $0.03, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets that is temporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a permanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue.
In addition to serving the taconite industry, Minnesota Power serves a number of customers in the paper, pulp and secondary wood products industry, which represented 1,303 million kWh, or 20 percent, of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2016. The four major paper and pulp mills we serve reported operating at, or near, full capacity in 2016. Minnesota Power also has agreements to provide steam for two of its paper and pulp customers for use in the customers’ operations.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Large Power Customer Contracts. Minnesota Power has 9 Large Power Customer contracts, each serving requirements of 10 MW or more of customer load. The customers consist of six taconite facilities, two concentrate reclamation facilities and four paper and pulp mills. Certain facilities have common ownership and are served under combined contracts.
Large Power Customer contracts require Minnesota Power to have a certain amount of generating capacity available. In turn, each Large Power Customer is required to pay a minimum monthly demand charge that covers the fixed costs associated with having this capacity available to serve the customer, including a return on common equity. Most contracts allow customers to establish the level of megawatts subject to a demand charge on a four-month basis and require that a portion of their megawatt needs be committed on a take-or-pay basis for at least a portion of the term of the agreement. In addition to the demand charge, each Large Power Customer is billed an energy charge for each kWh used that recovers the variable costs incurred in generating electricity. Four of the Large Power Customer contracts have interruptible service which provides a discounted demand rate in exchange for the ability to interrupt the customers during system emergencies. Minnesota Power also provides incremental production service for customer demand levels above the contractual take-or-pay levels. There is no demand charge for this service and energy is priced at an increment above Minnesota Power’s cost. Incremental production service is interruptible.
All contracts with Large Power Customers continue past the contract termination date unless the required advance notice of cancellation has been given. The required advance notice of cancellation varies from one to four years. Such contracts minimize the impact on earnings that otherwise would result from significant reductions in kWh sales to such customers. Large Power Customers are required to take all of their purchased electric service requirements from Minnesota Power for the duration of their contracts. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change through the same regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. (See Item 1. Business – Regulated Operations – Regulatory Matters – Electric Rates.)
Minnesota Power, as permitted by the MPUC, requires its taconite-producing Large Power Customers to pay weekly for electric usage based on monthly energy usage estimates. These customers receive estimated bills based on Minnesota Power’s estimate of the customer’s energy usage, forecasted energy prices and fuel clause adjustment estimates. Minnesota Power’s taconite‑producing Large Power Customers have generally predictable energy usage on a week-to-week basis and any differences that occur are trued-up the following month.

Residential and Commercial Customers. In 2016, residential and commercial customers represented 18 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales. Minnesota Power provides regulated utility electric service in northeastern Minnesota to approximately 144,000 residential and commercial customers. SWL&P provides regulated electric, natural gas and water service in northwestern Wisconsin to approximately 15,000 electric customers, 13,000 natural gas customers and 10,000 water customers.
Municipal Customers. In 2016, municipal customers represented 6 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales. Minnesota Power has 16 non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota. All of the municipal contracts include a termination clause requiring a three-year notice to terminate.
In April 2015, Minnesota Power amended its formula-based wholesale electric sales contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission, extending the term through June 30, 2028. No termination notice may be given prior to June 30, 2025. The electric service agreement with one other municipal customer is effective through June 30, 2019. The other municipal customer provided termination notice for its contract on June 30, 2016. Minnesota Power currently provides approximately 29 MW of average monthly demand to this customer. The rates included in these two contracts are set each July 1 based on a cost-based formula methodology, using estimated costs and a rate of return that is equal to Minnesota Power’s authorized rate of return for Minnesota retail customers (currently 10.38 percent). The formula-based rate methodology also provides for a yearly true-up calculation for actual costs incurred.

Municipal Customers (Continued)
In September 2015, Minnesota Power amended its wholesale electric contracts with 14 municipal customers, extending the contract terms through December 31, 2024. No termination notices may be given prior to December 31, 2021. These contracts include fixed capacity charges through 2018; beginning in 2019, the capacity charge will not increase by more than two percent or decrease by more than one percent from the previous year’s capacity charge and will be determined using a cost-based formula methodology. The base energy charge for each year of the contract term will be set each January 1, subject to monthly adjustment, and will also be determined using a cost-based formula methodology. 
Other Power Suppliers. The Company also enters into off-system sales with Other Power Suppliers. These sales are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations.
Basin PSA. Minnesota Power has an agreement to sell 100 MW of capacity and energy to Basin for a ten‑year period which expires in April 2020. The capacity charge is based on a fixed monthly schedule with a minimum annual escalation provision. The energy charge is based on a fixed monthly schedule and provides for annual escalation based on the cost of fuel. The agreement also allows Minnesota Power to recover a pro rata share of increased costs related to emissions that occur during the last five years of the contract. In July 2015, Minnesota Power entered into an additional agreement to sell 100 MW of capacity to Basin at fixed rates for a two-year period beginning in June 2016.
Minnkota Power PSA. Minnesota Power has a PSA with Minnkota Power, which commenced in 2014. Under the PSA, Minnesota Power is selling a portion of its entitlement from Square Butte to Minnkota Power, resulting in Minnkota Power’s net entitlement increasing and Minnesota Power’s net entitlement decreasing until Minnesota Power’s share is eliminated at the end of 2025. Of Minnesota Power’s 50 percent output entitlement, it sold to Minnkota Power approximately 28 percent in 2016 (28 percent in 2015; 23 percent in 2014). (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)
Silver Bay Power PSA. On May 23, 2016, Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power entered into a long-term PSA through 2031. Silver Bay Power supplies approximately 90 MW of load to Northshore Mining, an affiliate of Silver Bay Power, which has been served predominately through self-generation by Silver Bay Power. In the years 2016 through 2019, Minnesota Power will supply Silver Bay Power with at least 50 MW of energy and Silver Bay Power will have the option to purchase additional energy from Minnesota Power as it transitions away from self-generation. On December 31, 2019, Silver Bay Power will cease self-generation and Minnesota Power will supply the entire energy requirements for Silver Bay Power.
Seasonality
The operations of our industrial customers, which make up a large portion of our electric sales, are not typically subject to significant seasonal variations. (See Electric Sales / Customers.) As a result, Minnesota Power is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in electric sales; however, Minnesota Power and SWL&P electric and natural gas sales to other customers may be affected by seasonal differences in weather. In general, peak electric sales occur in the winter and summer months with fewer electric sales in the spring or fall. Peak sales of natural gas generally occur in the winter months. Additionally, our regulated utilities have historically generated fewer sales and less revenue when weather conditions are milder in the winter and summer.
Power Supply
In order to meet its customers’ electric requirements, Minnesota Power utilizes a mix of its own generation and purchased power. As of December 31, 2016, Minnesota Power’s generating capability is primarily coal-fired, but also includes approximately 172 MW of natural gas-fired and biomass co-fired generation, 120 MW of hydroelectric generation, 522 MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation and 10 MW of solar generation. Purchased power consists of long-term coal, wind and hydro PPAs as well as market purchases. The following table reflects Minnesota Power’s generating capabilities as of December 31, 2016, and total electrical supply for 2016. Minnesota Power had an annual net peak load of 1,520 MW on December 15, 2016.

Power Supply (Continued)
Fuel. Minnesota Power purchases low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin region located in Montana and Wyoming. Coal consumption in 2016 for electric generation at Minnesota Power’s coal-fired generating stations was 4.2 million tons. As of December 31, 2016, Minnesota Power had coal inventories of 1.4 million tons (1.6 million tons as of December 31, 2015). Minnesota Power’s coal supply agreements have expiration dates through December 2017 for a significant portion of its coal requirements and December 2021 for a portion of its coal requirements. In 2017, Minnesota Power expects to obtain coal under these coal supply agreements and in the spot market. Minnesota Power continues to explore other future coal supply options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal will continue to be available.
Minnesota Power also has coal transportation agreements in place for the delivery of a significant portion of its coal requirements through December 2018. The delivered costs of fuel for Minnesota Power’s generation are recoverable from Minnesota Power’s utility customers through the fuel adjustment clause.

Long-Term Purchased Power. Minnesota Power has contracts to purchase capacity and energy from various entities, including output from certain coal, wind and hydro generating facilities. 
Our PPAs are detailed in Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, with additional disclosure provided in the following paragraph.
Square Butte PPA. Under the long-term agreement with Square Butte, which expires at the end of 2026, Minnesota Power is entitled to 50 percent of the output of Square Butte’s 455-MW coal-fired generating unit located near Center, North Dakota. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) BNI Energy supplies lignite coal to Square Butte. This lignite supply is sufficient to provide fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating unit. Square Butte’s cost of lignite consumed in 2016 was approximately $1.57 per MBtu. (See Electric Sales / Customers – Minnkota Power PSA.)
Transmission and Distribution
We have electric transmission and distribution lines of 500 kV (8 miles), 345 kV (242 miles), 250 kV (465 miles), 230 kV (761 miles), 161 kV (43 miles), 138 kV (190 miles), 115 kV (1,299 miles) and less than 115 kV (6,308 miles). We own and operate 165 substations with a total capacity of 8,396 megavoltamperes. Some of our transmission and distribution lines interconnect with other utilities.
CapX2020. Minnesota Power is a participant in the CapX2020 initiative which represents an effort to ensure electric transmission and distribution reliability in Minnesota and the surrounding region for the future. CapX2020, which consists of electric cooperatives and municipal and investor-owned utilities, including Minnesota’s largest transmission owners, assessed the transmission system and projected growth in customer demand for electricity through 2020. Minnesota Power participated in three CapX2020 projects which were completed and placed in service in 2011, 2012 and 2015. Minnesota Power invested approximately $100 million to complete the three transmission line projects. 
Great Northern Transmission Line. As a condition of the 250 MW long-term PPA entered into with Manitoba Hydro, construction of additional transmission capacity is required. As a result, Minnesota Power and Manitoba Hydro proposed construction of the GNTL, an approximately 220-mile 500-kV transmission line between Manitoba and Minnesota’s Iron Range in order to strengthen the electric grid, enhance regional reliability and promote a greater exchange of sustainable energy.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Transmission and Distribution (Continued)
The GNTL is subject to various federal and state regulatory approvals. In 2013, a certificate of need application was filed with the MPUC which was approved in a June 2015 order. Based on this order, Minnesota Power’s portion of the investments and expenditures for the project are eligible for cost recovery under its existing transmission cost recovery rider and are anticipated to be included in future transmission factor filings. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) In a December 2015 order, the FERC approved our request to recover on construction work in progress related to the GNTL from Minnesota Power’s wholesale customers. In 2014, Minnesota Power filed a route permit application with the MPUC and a request for a presidential permit to cross the U.S.-Canadian border with the U.S. Department of Energy. In an order dated April 11, 2016, the MPUC approved the route permit which largely follows Minnesota Power’s preferred route, including the international border crossing, and on November 16, 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a presidential permit, which was the final major regulatory approval needed before construction in the U.S. can begin in early 2017. Construction is expected to be completed in 2020, and total project cost in the U.S., including substation work, is estimated to be between $560 million and $710 million. Minnesota Power is expected to have majority ownership of the transmission line.
Manitoba Hydro must obtain regulatory and governmental approvals related to a new transmission line in Canada. In September 2015, Manitoba Hydro submitted the final preferred route and EIS for the transmission line in Canada to the Manitoba Conservation and Water Stewardship for regulatory approval. Construction of Manitoba Hydro’s hydroelectric generation facility commenced in 2014.
Investment in ATC
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ALLETE Transmission Holdings, owns approximately 8 percent of ATC, a Wisconsin-based utility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in parts of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. We account for our investment in ATC under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2016, our equity investment in ATC was $135.6 million ($124.5 million at December 31, 2015). (See Note 5. Investment in ATC.) 
On September 28, 2016, the FERC issued an order reducing ATC’s authorized return on equity to 10.32 percent, or 10.82 percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization. Prior to this order, ATC had been allowed a return on equity of 12.2 percent which had been impacted by reductions for estimated refunds related to complaints filed with the FERC by several customers located within the MISO service area. 
On June 30, 2016, a federal administrative law judge ruled on an additional complaint proposing a further reduction in the base return on equity to 9.70 percent, or 10.20 percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization, subject to approval or adjustment by the FERC. A final decision from the FERC on the administrative law judge’s recommendation is expected in 2017. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) We estimate that for every 50 basis point reduction in ATC’s allowed return on equity our equity earnings in ATC would be impacted annually by approximately $0.5 million after-tax. 
ATC’s 10-year transmission assessment, which covers the years 2016 through 2025, identifies a need for between $3.6 billion and $4.4 billion in transmission system investments. These investments by ATC, if undertaken, are expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated cash, debt and investor contributions. As opportunities arise, we plan to make additional investments in ATC through general capital calls based upon our pro rata ownership interest in ATC.
ATC and Duke Energy Corporation are partners in a joint venture, Duke-American Transmission Co. (DATC) which builds, owns and operates electric transmission facilities in North America. DATC is subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, various independent system operators and state regulatory authorities. 
During 2016, ATC formed ATC Development LLC, which is a separate entity formed by the investor-owned utility members of ATC to pursue development outside of ATC’s traditional footprint. ATC Development LLC draws upon ATC’s transmission experience to pursue transmission development opportunities. ALLETE has an approximate 9 percent ownership in ATC Development LLC. ATC Development LLC may incur development expenses as it pursues transmission projects; we will recognize our proportional share of these expenses as they occur.
In January 2017, ATC Development LLC and Arizona Electric Power Cooperative formed ATC Southwest to jointly develop transmission projects in Arizona and the southwestern United States. ATC Southwest will benefit electric cooperative members and electric consumers in the Southwest by developing options to help address the demand for an affordable, reliable transmission system.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Properties
Our Regulated Operations businesses own office and service buildings, an energy control center, repair shops, electric plants, transmission facilities and storerooms in various localities in Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota. All of the electric plants are subject to mortgages, which collateralize the outstanding first mortgage bonds of Minnesota Power and SWL&P. Most of the generating plants and substations are located on real property owned by Minnesota Power or SWL&P, subject to the lien of a mortgage, whereas most of the electric lines are located on real property owned by others with appropriate easement rights or necessary permits from governmental authorities. WPPI Energy owns 20 percent of Boswell Unit 4. WPPI Energy has the right to use our transmission line facilities to transport its share of Boswell generation. (See Note 3. Jointly-Owned Facilities and Projects.)
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory authorities and other organizations. 
Electric Rates. All rates and contract terms in our Regulated Operations are subject to approval by applicable regulatory authorities. Minnesota Power and SWL&P design their retail electric service rates based on cost of service studies under which allocations are made to the various classes of customers as approved by the MPUC or the PSCW. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment clauses, which may adjust electric service rates for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy, recovery of current and deferred conservation improvement program expenditures and recovery of certain transmission, renewable and environmental investments.
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The MPUC has regulatory authority over Minnesota Power’s retail service area in Minnesota, retail rates, retail services, capital structure, issuance of securities and other matters. Minnesota Power’s current retail rates are based on a 2011 MPUC retail rate order that allows for a 10.38 percent return on common equity and a 54.29 percent equity ratio. As authorized by the MPUC, Minnesota Power also recognizes revenue under cost recovery riders for transmission, renewable and environmental investments.
2016 Minnesota General Rate Case. On November 2, 2016, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average increase of approximately 9 percent for retail customers. The rate filing seeks a return on equity of 10.25 percent and a 53.8 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would generate approximately $55 million in additional revenue. On December 12, 2016, due to a change in its electric sales forecast, Minnesota Power filed a request to modify its original interim rate proposal reducing its requested interim rate increase to $34.7 million from the original request of approximately $49 million; Minnesota Power will file to update its final retail rate increase request by February 28, 2017, and expects the final retail rate increase request to decrease similar to the interim rate proposal. In orders dated December 30, 2016, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and authorized an annual interim rate increase of $34.7 million beginning January 1, 2017. As part of this rate increase request, we are seeking an extension of the recovery period for Boswell to better reflect recent environmental investments at the facility and mitigate rate increases for our customers. If approved, annual depreciation expense will be reduced by approximately $25 million. If the requested recovery period extension is not approved, we would expect final rates to be increased by a similar amount. We cannot predict the level of final rates that may be authorized by the MPUC. 
Additional regulatory proceedings pending with the MPUC are detailed in Note 4. Regulatory Matters.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of hydroelectric projects, the establishment of rates and charges for transmission of electricity in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale (including the rates for Minnesota Power’s municipal and wholesale customers), natural gas transportation, certain accounting and record-keeping practices, certain activities of our regulated utilities and the operations of ATC. FERC jurisdiction also includes enforcement of NERC mandatory electric reliability standards. Violations of FERC rules are subject to enforcement action by the FERC including financial penalties up to $1 million per day per violation. Regulatory proceedings pending with the FERC are detailed in Note 4. Regulatory Matters.
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. The PSCW has regulatory authority over SWL&P’s retail sales of electricity, natural gas and water, issuances of securities and other matters. SWL&P’s current retail rates are based on a 2012 PSCW retail rate order that allows for a 10.9 percent return on common equity.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Regulatory Matters (Continued)
2016 Wisconsin General Rate Case. On June 28, 2016, SWL&P filed a rate increase request with the PSCW requesting an average overall increase of 3.1 percent for retail customers (a 3.5 percent increase in electric rates, a 1.3 percent decrease in natural gas rates and a 7.8 percent increase in water rates). The rate filing seeks an overall return on equity of 10.9 percent and a 55 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested rate increase would generate approximately $2.7 million in additional revenue. Hearings are expected to be scheduled in the first half of 2017. The Company anticipates new rates will take effect during the second quarter of 2017. We cannot predict the level of rates that may be approved by the PSCW. 
North Dakota Public Service Commission. The NDPSC has jurisdiction over site and route permitting of generation and transmission facilities in North Dakota.
Regional Organizations
Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. Minnesota Power and SWL&P are members of MISO, a regional transmission organization. While Minnesota Power and SWL&P retain ownership of their respective transmission assets, their transmission networks are under the regional operational control of MISO. Minnesota Power and SWL&P take and provide transmission service under the MISO open access transmission tariff. MISO continues its efforts to oversee the safe, cost-effective delivery of electric power across all or parts of 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba which includes nearly 175,000 MW of generating capacity.
North American Electric Reliability Corporation. The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization. The NERC ensures the reliability of the North American bulk power system. The NERC oversees eight regional entities that establish requirements, approved by the FERC, for reliable operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and transmission systems. Minnesota Power is subject to these reliability requirements and can incur significant penalties for non-compliance.
Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO). Minnesota Power is a member of the MRO, one of the eight regional entities overseen by the NERC. The MRO's primary responsibilities are to: ensure compliance with mandatory reliability standards by entities who own, operate or use the interconnected, international bulk power system; conduct assessments of the grid's ability to meet electricity demand in the region; and analyze regional system events.
The MRO region spans the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and all or parts of the states of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The region includes more than 130 organizations that are involved in the production and delivery of electricity to more than 20 million people. These organizations include municipal utilities, cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, transmission system operators, a federal power marketing agency, Canadian Crown corporations, and independent power producers.
Minnesota Legislation
Renewable Energy. In February 2007, Minnesota enacted a law requiring 25 percent of electric utilities’ applicable retail and municipal energy sales in Minnesota to be from renewable energy sources by 2025. The law also requires Minnesota Power to meet interim milestones of 12 percent by 2012, 17 percent by 2016 and 20 percent by 2020. The law allows the MPUC to modify or delay meeting a milestone if implementation will cause significant ratepayer cost or technical reliability issues. If a utility is not in compliance with a milestone, the MPUC may order the utility to construct facilities, purchase renewable energy or purchase renewable energy credits. Minnesota Power’s 2015 IRP, which was filed with the MPUC in September 2015 and approved with modifications by the MPUC in an order dated July 18, 2016, includes an update on its plans and progress in meeting the Minnesota renewable energy milestones through 2025. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – EnergyForward.) 
Minnesota Power continues to execute its renewable energy strategy through key renewable projects that will ensure it meets the identified state mandate at the lowest cost for customers. Minnesota Power has exceeded the interim milestone requirements to date with approximately 33 percent of its applicable retail and municipal energy sales supplied by renewable energy sources in 2016.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Minnesota Legislation (Continued)
Minnesota Solar Energy Standard. In 2013, legislation was enacted by the state of Minnesota requiring at least 1.5 percent of total retail electric sales, excluding sales to certain customers, to be generated by solar energy by the end of 2020. At least 10 percent of the 1.5 percent mandate must be met by solar energy generated by or procured from solar photovoltaic devices with a nameplate capacity of 20 kW or less. Minnesota Power has one completed solar project and another under development. In August 2015, Minnesota Power filed for MPUC approval of a 10 MW utility scale solar project at the Camp Ripley Minnesota Army National Guard base and training facility near Little Falls, Minnesota. In an order dated February 24, 2016, the MPUC approved the Camp Ripley solar project as eligible to meet the solar energy standard and for current cost recovery, which was subsequently finalized by the MPUC in an order dated December 12, 2016. The Camp Ripley solar project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. In September 2015, Minnesota Power filed for MPUC approval of a community solar garden project in northeastern Minnesota, which is comprised of a 1 MW solar array to be owned and operated by a third party with the output purchased by Minnesota Power and a 40 kW solar array that will be owned and operated by Minnesota Power. In an order dated July 27, 2016, the MPUC approved the community solar garden project and cost recovery, subject to certain compliance requirements. Minnesota Power believes these projects will meet approximately one-third of the overall mandate. Additionally, on January 19, 2017, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power’s proposal to increase the amount of solar rebates available for customer-sited solar installations and recover costs of the program through Minnesota Power’s renewable cost recovery rider. This proposal to incentivize customer-sited solar installations is expected to meet a portion of the required mandate related to solar photovoltaic devices with a nameplate capacity of 20 kW or less. 
Energy-Intensive Trade-Exposed (EITE) Customer Rates. The Minnesota Legislature enacted EITE customer ratemaking law in June 2015 which established that it is the energy policy of the state to have competitive rates for certain industries such as mining and forest products. In November 2015, Minnesota Power filed a rate schedule petition with the MPUC for EITE customers and a corresponding rider for EITE cost recovery. The rate proposal was revenue and cash flow neutral to Minnesota Power. In an order dated March 23, 2016, the MPUC dismissed the petition without prejudice, providing Minnesota Power the option to refile the petition with additional information or file a new petition. On June 30, 2016, Minnesota Power filed a revised EITE petition with the MPUC which included additional information on the net benefits analysis, limits on eligible customers and term lengths for the EITE discount. In an order dated December 21, 2016, the MPUC approved a reduction in rates for EITE customers and determined that cost recovery will be addressed in a separate proceeding. Minnesota Power provided additional information on cost recovery allocation methods in a December 30, 2016, compliance filing.
Competition
Retail electric energy sales in Minnesota and Wisconsin are made to customers in assigned service territories. As a result, most retail electric customers in Minnesota do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. Large energy users of 2 MW and above that are located outside of a municipality are allowed to choose a supplier upon MPUC approval. Minnesota Power serves 12 Large Power facilities over 10 MW, none of which have engaged in a competitive rate process. No other large commercial or small industrial customers in Minnesota Power’s service territory have sought a provider outside Minnesota Power’s service territory since 1994. Retail electric and natural gas customers in Wisconsin do not have the ability to choose their energy supplier. In both states, however, electricity may compete with other forms of energy. Customers may also choose to generate their own electricity, or substitute other forms of energy for their manufacturing processes.
In 2016, 6 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales were to municipal customers in Minnesota by contract. These customers have the right to seek an energy supply from any wholesale electric service provider upon contract expiration. In April 2015, Minnesota Power amended its formula-based wholesale electric sales contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission, extending the term through June 30, 2028. In September 2015, Minnesota Power amended its wholesale electric contracts with 14 of its municipal customers, extending the contract terms through December 31, 2024. On June 30, 2016, one of Minnesota Power’s municipal customers provided termination notice for its contract effective June 30, 2019. Minnesota Power currently provides approximately 29 MW of average monthly demand to this customer. (See Electric Sales / Customers.)
The FERC has continued with its efforts to promote a more competitive wholesale market through open-access electric transmission and other means. As a result, our electric sales to Other Power Suppliers and our purchases to supply our retail and wholesale load are made in the competitive market.

SWL&P serves customers under electric, natural gas and/or water franchises in 1 city and 14 villages or towns.
ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELATED SERVICES
ALLETE Clean Energy
ALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns and operates, in four states, approximately 535 MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation that is from PSAs under various durations. In addition, ALLETE Clean Energy constructed and sold a 107 MW wind energy facility in 2015. On January 3, 2017, ALLETE Clean Energy announced that it will develop another wind energy facility of up to 50 MW after securing a 25‑year PSA. The PSA includes an option for the counterparty to purchase the facility upon development completion; construction is expected to begin in 2018.
ALLETE Clean Energy believes the market for renewable energy in North America is robust, driven by several factors including environmental regulation, tax incentives, societal expectations and continual technology advances. State renewable portfolio standards, and state or federal regulations to limit GHG emissions are examples of environmental regulation or public policy that we believe will drive renewable energy development.
ALLETE Clean Energy’s strategy includes the safe, reliable, optimal and profitable operation of its existing facilities. This includes a strong safety culture, the continuous pursuit of operational efficiencies at existing facilities and cost controls. ALLETE Clean Energy generally acquires facilities in liquid power markets and its strategy includes the exploration of PSA extensions upon expiration of existing contracts.
ALLETE Clean Energy will pursue growth through acquisitions or project development for others. ALLETE Clean Energy is targeting acquisitions of existing facilities up to 200 MW each, which have long-term PSAs in place for the facilities’ output. At this time, ALLETE Clean Energy expects acquisitions will be primarily wind or solar facilities in North America. ALLETE Clean Energy is also targeting the development of new facilities up to 200 MW each, which will have long-term PSAs in place for the output or may be sold upon completion. Federal production tax credit qualification is important to development project economics, and ALLETE Clean Energy invested approximately $100 million in equipment in 2016 to meet production tax credit safe harbor provisions.
ALLETE Clean Energy will manage risk by having a diverse portfolio of assets, which will include PSA expiration and geographic diversity. The current portfolio of approximately 535 MW is subject to typical variations in seasonal wind. The majority of its planned maintenance leverages this seasonality and is performed during lower wind periods. The current mix of PSA expiration and geographic location is as follows:

Wind Energy Facility | Location | Capacity MW | PSA MW | PSA Expiration
Armenia Mountain | Pennsylvania | 100.5 | 100% | 2024 
Chanarambie/Viking | Minnesota | 97.5 | | 
PSA 1 | | | 12% | 2018 
PSA 2 | | | 88% | 2023 
Condon | Oregon | 50 | 100% | 2022

The majority of ALLETE Clean Energy’s wind operations are located on real property owned by others with appropriate easements rights or necessary consents of governmental authorities. Two of ALLETE Clean Energy’s wind energy facilities are encumbered by liens against their assets securing financing. Such financings are structured to be repaid within the term of the existing long‑term PSAs. 
U.S. Water Services
On February 10, 2015, ALLETE acquired U.S. Water Services. U.S. Water Services provides integrated water management for industry by combining chemical, equipment, engineering and service for customized solutions to reduce water and energy usage, and improve efficiency. U.S. Water Services is located in 49 states and Canada and has an established base of approximately 4,800 customers. U.S. Water Services differentiates itself from the competition by developing synergies between established solutions in engineering, equipment and chemical water treatment, and helping customers achieve efficient and sustainable use of their water and energy systems. U.S. Water Services is a leading provider to the biofuels industry, and also serves the food and beverage, industrial, power generation, and midstream oil and gas industries. U.S. Water Services principally relies upon recurring revenue from a diverse mix of industrial customers. U.S. Water Services sells certain products which are seasonal in nature, with higher demand typically realized in warmer months; generally, lower sales occur in the first quarter of each year. The results for 2015 reflect operations for the date of acquisition, February 10, 2015, through December 31, 2015, and therefore, do not reflect a full twelve months. 
Our strategy is to grow U.S. Water Services’ North American presence by adding customers, products and new geographies. We believe water scarcity and a growing emphasis on conservation will continue to drive significant growth in the industrial, commercial and governmental sectors leading to organic revenue growth for U.S. Water Services. U.S. Water Services also expects to pursue periodic strategic tuck-in acquisitions with a purchase price in the $10 million to $50 million range. Priority will be given to acquisitions which expand its geographic reach, add new technology or deepen its capabilities to serve its expanding customer base. 
U.S. Water Services leases an office and production facility at its headquarters in Minnesota as well as various office, warehouse and production facilities across the United States.
CORPORATE AND OTHER
BNI Energy
BNI Energy is a supplier of lignite in North Dakota, producing approximately 4 million tons annually and has lignite reserves of an estimated 650 million tons. Two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte, presently consume virtually all of BNI Energy’s production of lignite under cost-plus fixed fee coal supply agreements extending through December 31, 2037. (See Item 1. Business – Regulated Operations – Power Supply – Long-Term Purchased Power and Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) The mining process disturbs and reclaims between 200 and 250 acres per year. Laws require that the reclaimed land be at least as productive as it was prior to mining. As of December 31, 2016, BNI Energy had a $23.5 million asset reclamation obligation ($22.1 million as of December 31, 2015) included in Other Non-Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These costs are included in the cost-plus fixed fee contract, for which an asset reclamation cost receivable was included in Other Non-Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The asset reclamation obligation is guaranteed by surety bonds and a letter of credit. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)

(b) | Units and square footage are estimated. Density at build out may differ from these estimates.

In addition to the two projects, ALLETE Properties has approximately 1,100 acres of other land available-for-sale. 
In recent years, market conditions for real estate in Florida have required us to review our land inventories for impairment. In 2015, the Company reevaluated its strategy related to the real estate assets of ALLETE Properties in response to market conditions and transaction activity. The revised strategy incorporated the possibility of a bulk sale of its entire portfolio which, if consummated, would likely result in sales proceeds below the book value of the real estate assets. Proceeds from such a sale would be strategically deployed to support growth in our energy infrastructure and related services businesses. ALLETE Properties also continues to pursue sales of individual parcels over time. ALLETE Properties will continue to maintain key entitlements and infrastructure without making additional investments or acquisitions.
In connection with implementing the revised strategy, management evaluated its impairment analysis for its real estate assets using updated assumptions to determine estimated future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis. Estimated fair values were based upon current market data and pricing for individual parcels. Our impairment analysis incorporates a probability-weighted approach considering the alternative courses of sales noted above. 
Based on the results of the 2015 undiscounted cash flow analysis, the undiscounted future net cash flows were not adequate to recover the carrying value of the real estate assets leading to an adjustment of carrying value to estimated fair value. Estimated fair value was derived using Level 3 inputs, including current market interest in the property for a bulk sale of its entire portfolio, and discounted cash flow analysis of estimated selling price for sales over time. As a result, a non-cash impairment charge of $36.3 million was recorded in 2015 to reduce the carrying value of the real estate to its estimated fair value.
In 2016 and 2014, impairment analyses of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows were conducted and indicated that the cash flows were adequate to recover the carrying value of ALLETE Properties real estate assets. As a result, no impairment was recorded in 2016 or 2014.
On September 22, 2016, ALLETE Properties sold its Ormond Crossings project and Lake Swamp wetland mitigation bank for consideration of approximately $21 million. The consideration included a down payment in the form of 0.1 million shares of ALLETE common stock with a value of $8.0 million, with the remaining purchase price to be paid under the terms of a finance receivable due over a five-year period which bears interest at market rates. The finance receivable is collateralized by the property sold.
Seller Financing. ALLETE Properties occasionally provides seller financing to certain qualified buyers. As of December 31, 2016, outstanding finance receivables were $13.9 million, net of reserves, with maturities through 2021. These finance receivables accrue interest at market-based rates and are collateralized by the financed properties.
Regulation. A substantial portion of our development properties in Florida are subject to federal, state and local regulations, and restrictions that may impose significant costs or limitations on our ability to develop the properties. Much of our property is vacant land and some is located in areas where development may affect the natural habitats of various protected wildlife species or in sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands.
Non-Rate Base Generation and Miscellaneous

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state and local authorities. A number of regulatory changes to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements have recently been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities. Minnesota Power’s facilities are subject to additional regulation under many of these regulations. In response to these regulations, Minnesota Power is reshaping its generation portfolio over time to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and policy during rulemaking implementation.
We consider our businesses to be in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and believe all necessary permits to conduct such operations have been obtained. We anticipate that with many state and federal environmental regulations finalized, or to be finalized in the near future, potential expenditures for future environmental matters may be material and may require significant capital investments. Minnesota Power has evaluated various environmental compliance scenarios using possible outcomes of environmental regulations to project power supply trends and impacts on customers.
We review environmental matters on a quarterly basis. Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. Accruals are adjusted as assessment and remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information become available. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. Costs related to environmental contamination treatment and cleanup are expensed unless recoverable in rates from customers. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)
