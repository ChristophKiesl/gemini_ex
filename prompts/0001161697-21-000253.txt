Item 1. Business.
Our Corporate History and Background

We were originally formed as RX Scripted, LLC on December 30, 2004 as a North Carolina limited liability company and then converted to a Nevada corporation as RX Scripted, Inc. on December 5, 2007. We remain a Nevada corporation. On January 7, 2010, we changed our name to MedCareers Group, Inc. MedCareers Group operated a website for nurses, nursing schools and nurses’ organizations to foster better communication between nurses and the nursing profession. On November 19, 2010 , the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange”) with Nurses Lounge, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Nurses Lounge”) and its nine shareholders (the “Nurses Lounge Shareholders”), whereby we issued 24,000,000 restricted shares of common stock to the Nurses Lounge Shareholders in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Nurses Lounge. Although 24,000,000 restricted shares were issued in connection with the Exchange, certain of our significant shareholders agreed to cancel some of the shares of common stock they owned so that the net effect of the Exchange was an increase to the outstanding shares of common stock by 7,175,000 shares rather than 24,000,000. Included in the shareholders receiving shares of common stock in connection with the Exchange, was Timothy Armes, founder and president of Nurses Lounge, Inc., who received 14,902,795 shares.

On November 29, 2018, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement whereby we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of The 4LESS Corp. (“4Less”), a private company, in exchange for our issuance of nineteen thousand (19,000) shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, 6,750 Series C Preferred Shares, and 870 Series D Preferred Shares.


Shareholder | # of Series B Preferred | # of Series C Preferred | # of Series D Preferred
Christopher Davenport | 17,100 | 6,075 | 675 
Sergio Salzano | 1,900 | 675 | 75 
Timothy Armes | 1,000 | 0 | 120 
TOTAL | 20,000 | 6,750 | 870

 The Series C Preferred Shares have a right to convert into our common stock by multiplying the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock by 2.63 on the conversion date. As a result of this Share Exchange, the former shareholders of the private company, 4Less, became our controlling shareholders. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse takeover/recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein the private company, 4Less is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Pursuant to the transaction, Tim Armes, our CEO, cancelled 60,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for 120 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. As a result of the transaction, 4Less, the private company, became our wholly owned subsidiary and there was a change in our control whereby Christopher Davenport and Sergio Salzano, collectively then hold voting rights equal to 63.37% of the total voting rights at any given time by virtue of holding 95% of the Series B Preferred Stock. 

On December 12, 2019, The 4Less Corp. name was changed to Auto Parts 4Less, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and continues to operate as our wholly owned subsidiary.

Significant Developments in fiscal 2021

At the beginning of 2020, we established our goals which were to reduce debt, obtain minimally dilutive new capital, cut costs and develop the AutoParts4Less.com marketplace.


● | The reduction of debt, began in late January of 2020, first by exchanging $1.1 million of debt, that was convertible at highly discounted rates, in exchange for 250 shares of The 4Less Group’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. The 250 shares of Series C Preferred represent an approximate 2.5% ownership stake. 
 | This was followed in August 2020 by the exchange of the remaining highly discounted convertible debt totaling approximately $2.3 million in principal and accrued interest, plus over $1 million in additional associated derivative liabilities. 
 | The convertible debt was replaced with a $1.2 million, non-convertible promissory note with a 2-year term and a fixed interest rate of 12%, which resulting s in savings of $1.1 million in total debt with a substantially lower interest rate. 
 | As part of the settlement, the investor received, along with the 1.2 million note, 950 thousand warrants with a $0.40 exercise price and 150 shares of series C preferred shares. 
● | With the Company’s debt restructuring complete, it focused on ways to raise additional capital that would be minimally dilutive to existing shareholders. To accomplish these goals we began first by reducing our authorized shares from 1 billion down to 15 million and then applied for and was approved for our common stock to be quoted on the OTC Markets Group, Inc.’s OTCQB® tier Venture Market (the “OTCQB”) under the symbol “FLES”, which became effective as of the open of trading on February 16, 2021. 
 | On December 21, 2020 we were qualified by the SEC to begin a $15 million tier 2 Regulation A capital raise at $2.00 per share for a one year period. If f the entire 15 million is raised, it will add an additional 7,500,000 common shares to our shares outstanding. 
● | We achieved substantial cost cutting by reducing our employee head count down to 7 full time individuals as well as the consolidation of office space into a portion of our warehouse area. Additionally, we hired Commerce Pundit, an international software development firm with offices in the U.S. and India to begin development of our multivendor auto parts marketplace, AutoParts4Less.com, which we expect to launch in mid-summer of 2021.
