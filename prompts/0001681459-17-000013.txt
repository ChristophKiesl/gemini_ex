ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
On May 19, 2016, FMC Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“FMCTI”), and Technip S.A., a French société anonyme (“Technip”), announced their intention to combine in a transaction that the boards of directors of FMCTI and Technip believe represents a compelling opportunity to create a new global leader in Subsea, Surface and Onshore/Offshore systems and services to the oil and gas industry with the capacity to redefine the production of oil and gas through continued growth and innovation.
TechnipFMC plc (“TechnipFMC”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMCTI. On December 9, 2015, TechnipFMC was incorporated under the laws of England and Wales as a private limited company under the name FMC Technologies SIS Limited, for the purpose of entering into a definitive Business Combination Agreement, dated as of June 14, 2016 (the “Business Combination Agreement”). On August 4, 2016, the legal name of FMC Technologies SIS Limited was changed to TechnipFMC Limited, and, on January 11, 2017, was subsequently re-registered as TechnipFMC plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Technip will merge with TechnipFMC, with TechnipFMC continuing as the surviving company (the “Technip Merger”), and each ordinary share of Technip (the “Technip Shares”), other than Technip Shares owned by Technip or its wholly owned subsidiaries, will be exchanged for 2.00 ordinary shares of TechnipFMC (“TechnipFMC Shares”), subject to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. Immediately following the Technip Merger, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of TechnipFMC (“Merger Sub”) will merge with FMCTI, with FMCTI continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of TechnipFMC (the “FMCTI Merger” and, together with the Technip Merger, the “Mergers”), and each share of common stock of FMCTI (the “FMCTI Shares”), other than FMCTI Shares owned by FMCTI, TechnipFMC, Merger Sub or their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be exchanged for 1.00 TechnipFMC Share, subject to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. 
On December 14, 2016, FMCTI, Technip and TechnipFMC, entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment”) to the Business Combination Agreement by and among FMCTI, Technip and TechnipFMC. The Amendment provides for certain technical changes to the Business Combination Agreement, including certain closing mechanics. 
FMCTI, Technip and TechnipFMC also entered into a Joinder Agreement (the “Joinder”) with TechnipFMC US Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub”), TechnipFMC Holdings plc, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (“UK Holdco”), and TechnipFMC US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“US Holdco”), whereby UK Holdco, US Holdco and Merger Sub became a party to the Business Combination Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally named therein. 
TechnipFMC has not conducted any business operations other than that which are incidental to its formation and in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. Following the Mergers, TechnipFMC will be the holding company of the combined businesses of FMCTI and Technip, and it is expected that TechnipFMC Shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the regulated market of Euronext Paris. 
The principal executive offices of TechnipFMC are located at 1 St. Paul’s Churchyard, London EC4M 8AP, United Kingdom and its telephone number at that address is +44 203 429 3900.
