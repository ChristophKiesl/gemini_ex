ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Anavex Life Sciences Corp. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of differentiated therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases including drug candidates to treat Alzheimer’s disease, other central nervous system (“CNS”) diseases, pain and various types of cancer. Our lead compound, ANAVEX®2-73, is being developed to treat Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and potentially other central nervous system diseases, including rare diseases, such as Rett syndrome, a severe neurological disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2).
 
In November 2016, a Phase 2a clinical trial, consisting of PART A and PART B, which lasted a total of 57 weeks, was completed for ANAVEX®2-73 in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s patients. This open-label randomized trial met both primary and secondary endpoints, and was designed to assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX®2-73 in 32 patients. ANAVEX®2-73 targets sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors, which have been shown in preclinical studies to reduce stress levels in the brain believed to restore cellular homeostasis and to reverse the pathological hallmarks observed in Alzheimer’s disease. In October 2017, we presented pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data from its positive Phase 2a study, which established a concentration-effect relationship between ANAVEX®2-73 and study measurements. These measures obtained from all patients who participated in the entire 57 weeks include exploratory cognitive and functional scores as well as biomarker signals of brain activity. Additionally, ANAVEX®2-73 activity appears to be enhanced by its active metabolite (ANAVEX19-144), which also targets the sigma-1 receptor and has a half-life approximately twice as long as the parent molecule.
 
In March 2016, we received approval from the Ethics Committee in Australia to extend the Phase 2a clinical trial, which had been requested by patients and their caregivers. The trial extension allows participants who completed the 52-week PART B of the study to roll-over into a new trial and continue taking ANAVEX®2-73 for an additional 104 weeks, providing an opportunity to gather extended safety data. The trial is independent of our planned larger Phase 2/3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ANAVEX®2-73 in Alzheimer’s disease.
 
In February 2016, we presented positive preclinical data for ANAVEX®2-73 in Rett syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disease. The study was funded by the International Rett Syndrome Foundation (the “Rettsyndrome.org foundation”). In January 2017, we were awarded a financial grant from the Rettsyndrome.org foundation of a minimum of $0.6 million towards covering the costs of a planned U.S. multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The Phase 2 trial is scheduled to begin following the FDA’s approval of the Company’s investigational new drug (IND) application and will be a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of ANAVEX®2-73 in patients with Rett syndrome lasting up to 12 weeks. Primary and secondary endpoints include safety as well as Rett syndrome conditions such as cognitive impairment, motor impairment, behavioral symptoms and seizure activity.
  
In September 2016, we presented positive preclinical data for ANAVEX®2-73 in Parkinson’s disease, which demonstrated significant improvements on all measures: behavioral, histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. The study was funded by the Michael J Fox Foundation. Additional data was announced in October 2017 from the model for experimental parkinsonism. The data presented indicates that ANAVEX®2-73 induces robust neurorestoration in experimental parkinsonism. The encouraging results we have gathered in this model, coupled with the favorable profile of this compound in the Alzheimer’s disease trial, support the notion that ANAVEX®2-73 is a promising clinical candidate drug for Parkinson’s disease.
 
We intend to identify and initiate discussions with potential commercial partners within the next 12 months. Further, we may acquire or develop new intellectual property and assign, license, or otherwise transfer our intellectual property to further our goals.
 
Our Pipeline
 
Our research and development pipeline includes one clinical drug candidate and several compounds in different stages of pre-clinical study.
 
1


Our proprietary SIGMACEPTOR™ Discovery Platform produced small molecule drug candidates with unique modes of action, based on our understanding of sigma receptors. Sigma receptors may be targets for therapeutics to combat many human diseases, both of neurodegenerative nature, including Alzheimer’s disease, as well as of neurodevelopmental nature, like Rett syndrome, a rare disease. When bound by the appropriate ligands, sigma receptors influence the functioning of multiple biochemical signals that are involved in the pathogenesis (origin or development) of disease.
 
Compounds that have been subjects of our research include the following:
 
ANAVEX®2-73 
 
ANAVEX®2-73 may offer a disease-modifying approach in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by using ligands that activate sigma-1 receptors.
 
In AD animal models, ANAVEX®2-73 has shown pharmacological, histological and behavioral evidence as a potential neuroprotective, anti-amnesic, anti-convulsive and anti-depressive therapeutic agent, due to its potent affinity to sigma-1 receptors and moderate affinities to M1-4 type muscarinic receptors. In addition, ANAVEX®2-73 has shown a potential dual mechanism which may impact both amyloid and tau pathology. In a transgenic AD animal model Tg2576 ANAVEX®2-73 induced a statistically significant neuroprotective effect against the development of oxidative stress in the mouse brain, as well as significantly increased the expression of functional and synaptic plasticity markers that is apparently amyloid-beta independent. It also statistically alleviated the learning and memory deficits developed over time in the animals, regardless of sex, both in terms of spatial working memory and long-term spatial reference memory.
 
Based on the results of pre-clinical testing, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial of ANAVEX®2-73 in 2011. In this Phase 1 SAD trial, the maximum tolerated single dose was defined per protocol as 55-60 mg. This dose is above the equivalent dose shown to have positive effects in mouse models of AD. There were no significant changes in laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. ANAVEX®2-73 was well tolerated below the 55-60 mg dose with only mild adverse events in some subjects. Observed adverse events at doses above the maximum tolerated single dose included headache and dizziness, which were moderate in severity and reversible. These side effects are often seen with drugs that target CNS conditions, including AD.
 
The ANAVEX®2-73 Phase 1 SAD trial was conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Healthy male volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 received single, ascending oral doses over the course of the trial. Study endpoints included safety and tolerability together with pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetics includes the absorption and distribution of a drug, the rate at which a drug enters the blood and the duration of its effect, as well as chemical changes of the substance in the body. This study was conducted in Germany in collaboration with ABX-CRO, a clinical research organization that has conducted several Alzheimer’s disease studies, and the Technical University of Dresden.
 
In December 2014, a Phase 2a clinical trial was initiated for ANAVEX®2-73, which is being evaluated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The open-label randomized trial was designed to assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX®2-73 in 32 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. ANAVEX® 2-73 targets sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors, which have been shown in preclinical studies to reduce stress levels in the brain believed to restore cellular homeostasis and to reverse the pathological hallmarks observed in Alzheimer’s disease.
 
The Phase 2a study met both primary and secondary objectives of the study. The 31-week preliminary exploratory safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2a study of ANAVEX®2-73 in Alzheimer’s patients, with most receiving also donepezil, the current standard of care, demonstrated favorable safety, maximum tolerated dose, positive dose response, sustained efficacy response through 31 weeks for both cognitive and functional measures, as well as positive unexpected therapeutic response events. ANAVEX®2-73 continued to demonstrate a favorable adverse event (AE) profile through 31 weeks in a patient population of elderly Alzheimer’s patients with varying degrees of physical fragility. The most common side effects across all AE categories tended to be of mild severity grade 1, and were resolved with dose reductions that were anticipated within the adaptive design of the study protocol.

Through 57 weeks, Alzheimer’s patients taking a daily oral dose between 10mg and 50mg of ANAVEX®2-73 was well tolerated. There were no clinically significant treatment-related adverse events and no serious adverse events. Despite non-optimized dosing of ANAVEX®2-73 throughout the 57-week study, continued significant improvements from baseline of cognitive, functional and behavioral scores in a group of patients were observed, respectively. This data was analyzed using refined mathematical modeling methods in conjunction with the detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) information.
 
Pre-specified exploratory analyses included the cognitive (MMSE) and the functional (ADCS-ADL) changes from baseline. A continued stabilization of both cognitive (MMSE) and functional (ADCS-ADL) measures in patients treated with ANAVEX®2-73 was observed. This correlation was positive with all measured scores (MMSE, ADCS-ADL, Cogstate, HAM-D and EEG/ERP).
 
ANAVEX®2-73 data presented meets prerequisite information in order to progress into a Phase 2/3 placebo controlled study, which is currently in the preparation phase.
 
Preclinical data also validates ANAVEX®2-73 as a prospective platform drug for other neurodegenerative diseases beyond Alzheimer’s as well as neurodevelopmental diseases, more specifically, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. ANAVEX®2-73 demonstrated significant improvements in all of these indications in the respective preclinical animal models.
  
For Parkinson’s disease, data demonstrates significant improvements and restoration of function in a classic animal model of Parkinson’s disease. Significant improvements were seen on all measures tested: behavioral, histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. We are currently in preparation for a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
 
For epilepsy, data demonstrates both significant and dose related improvement in the reduction of seizures, as well as significant synergy with each of three generations of epilepsy drugs currently on the market.
 
In Rett syndrome, administration of ANAVEX®2-73 resulted in both significant and dose related improvements in an array of behavioral paradigms in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease model. In addition, in a further experiment sponsored by the Rettsyndrome.org foundation, ANAVEX®2-73 was evaluated in automatic visual response and respiration tests in 7-month old mice, an age at which advanced pathology is evident. Vehicle-treated MECP2 mice demonstrated fewer automatic visual responses than wild-type mice. Treatment with ANAVEX®2-73 for four weeks significantly increased the automatic visual response in the MECP2 Rett syndrome disease mouse.
 
We have filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, for ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome and are currently in preparation for a Phase 2 clinical trial. The IND might not be approved by the FDA, or it may be delayed or put on clinical hold or partial hold, or additional preclinical studies may be required.
 
In May 2017, we announced new preclinical data for ANAVEX®2-73 in the neurodevelopmental disorders Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. In a study sponsored by the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome, ANAVEX®2-73 was assessed in a mouse model for the development of audiogenic seizures. The results indicated that ANAVEX®2-73 administration significantly reduced audiogenic-induced seizures. In a recent study sponsored by FRAXA Research Foundation regarding Fragile X syndrome, data demonstrated that ANAVEX®2-73 restored hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression to normal levels. BDNF under-expression has been observed in many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative pathologies. BDNF signaling promotes maturation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. ANAVEX®2-73 normalization of BDNF expression could be a contributing factor for the positive data observed in both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders like Angelman and Fragile X syndromes.
 
Preclinical data presented also indicates that ANAVEX®2-73 demonstrates protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. In May 2016 and June 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome and infantile spasms, respectively.

Additionally, in October 2017 we presented additional data from a preclinical study on ANAVEX®2-73 related to multiple sclerosis. Data presented indicates that ANAVEX®2-73 may promote remyelination in multiple sclerosis disease. Further, data also demonstrates that ANAVEX®2-73 provides protection for oligodendrocytes (“OL’s”) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (“OPC’s”), as well as central nervous system neurons in addition to helping repair by increasing OPC proliferation and maturation in tissue culture.
 
ANAVEX 3-71
 
ANAVEX 3-71 is a preclinical drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action via sigma-1 receptor activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation, which has been shown to enhance neuroprotection and cognition in Alzheimer’s disease. ANAVEX 3-71 is a CNS-penetrable mono-therapy that bridges treatment of both cognitive impairments with disease modifications. It is highly effective in very small doses against the major Alzheimer’s hallmarks in transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, including cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies, and also has beneficial effects on inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions. ANAVEX 3-71 indicates extensive therapeutic advantages in Alzheimer’s and other protein-aggregation-related diseases given its ability to enhance neuroprotection and cognition via sigma-1 receptor activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation.
 
A recent preclinical study examined the response of ANAVEX 3-71 in aged transgenic animal models, and showed a significant reduction in the rate of cognitive deficit, amyloid beta pathology and inflammation with the administration of ANAVEX 3-71. In April 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to ANAVEX 3-71 for the treatment of Frontotemporal dementia.
 
In April 2017, new preclinical data was presented for ANAVEX 3-71 indicating that during pathological conditions, ANAVEX 3-71 demonstrated the formation of new synapses between neurons (synaptogenesis) without causing an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, synaptogenesis is believed to be impaired. Additional preclinical data presented also indicates that in addition to reducing oxidative stress, ANAVEX 3-71 demonstrates protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. 


ANAVEX 1-41
 
ANAVEX 1-41 is a sigma-1 agonist. Pre-clinical tests revealed significant neuroprotective benefits (i.e., protects nerve cells from degeneration or death) through the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial and oxidative stress, which damages and impairs cell viability. In addition, in animal models, ANAVEX 1-41 prevented the expression of caspase-3, an enzyme that plays a key role in apoptosis (programmed cell death) and loss of cells in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that regulates learning, emotion and memory. These activities involve both muscarinic and sigma-1 receptor systems through a novel mechanism of action.
 
Recent preclinical data presented also indicates that ANAVEX 1-41 demonstrates protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.

ANAVEX 1037 
 
ANAVEX 1037 is designed for the treatment of prostate cancer. It is a low molecular weight, synthetic compound exhibiting high affinity for sigma-1 receptors at nanomolar levels and moderate affinity for sigma-2 receptors and sodium channels at micromolar levels. In advanced pre-clinical studies, this compound revealed antitumor potential. It has also been shown to selectively kill human cancer cells without affecting normal/healthy cells and also to significantly suppress tumor growth in immune-deficient mice models. Scientific publications highlight the possibility that these ligands may stop tumor growth and induce selective cell death in various tumor cell lines. Sigma receptors are highly expressed in different tumor cell types. Binding by appropriate sigma-1 and/or sigma-2 ligands can induce selective apoptosis. In addition, through tumor cell membrane reorganization and interactions with ion channels, our drug candidates may play an important role in inhibiting the processes of metastasis (spreading of cancer cells from the original site to other parts of the body), angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and tumor cell proliferation.

ANAVEX 1066
 
ANAVEX 1066, a mixed sigma-1/sigma-2 ligand is designed for the potential treatment of neuropathic and visceral pain. ANAVEX 1066 was tested in two preclinical models of neuropathic and visceral pain that have been extensively validated in rats. In the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain, a single oral administration of ANAVEX 1066 dose-dependently restored the nociceptive threshold in the affected paw to normal levels while leaving the contralateral healthy paw unchanged. Efficacy was rapid and remained significant for two hours. In a model of visceral pain, chronic colonic hypersensitivity was induced by injection of an inflammatory agent directly into the colon and a single oral administration of ANAVEX 1066 returned the nociceptive threshold to control levels in a dose-dependent manner. Companion studies in rats demonstrated the lack of any effects on normal gastrointestinal transit with ANAVEX 1066 and a favorable safety profile in a battery of behavioral measures.
 
Our compounds are in the pre-clinical and clinical testing stages of development, and there is no guarantee that the activity demonstrated in pre-clinical models will be shown in human testing.
 
Our Target Indications
 
We have developed compounds with potential application to two broad categories and several specific indications. including:
 
Central Nervous System Diseases
 

● | Alzheimer’s disease - In 2016, an estimated 5.4 million Americans were suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The Alzheimer’s Association® reports that by 2025, 7.1 million Americans will be afflicted by the disease, a 30 percent increase from currently affected patients. Medications on the market today treat only the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and do not have the ability to stop its onset or its progression. There is an urgent and unmet need for both a disease modifying cure for Alzheimer’s disease as well as for better symptomatic treatments. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Parkinson’s disease – Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system marked by tremors, muscular rigidity, and slow, imprecise movement. It is associated with degeneration of the basal ganglia of the brain and a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Parkinson’s disease afflicts more than 10 million people worldwide, typically middle-aged and elderly people. The Parkinson’s disease market is set to expand from $2.1 billion in 2014 to $3.2 billion by 2021, according to business intelligence provider GBI Research. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rett syndrome - Rett syndrome is a rare X-linked genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops, including protein transcription, which is altered and as a result leads to severe disruptions in neuronal homeostasis. It is considered a rare, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder and is caused by a single mutation in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Because males have a different chromosome combination from females, boys who have the genetic MECP2 mutation are affected in devastating ways. Most of them die before birth or in early infancy. For females who survive infancy, Rett syndrome leads to severe impairments, affecting nearly every aspect of the child’s life; severe mental retardation, their ability to speak, walk and eat, sleeping problems, seizures and even the ability to breathe easily. Rett syndrome affects approximately 1 in every 10,000-15,000 females. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Depression - Depression is a major cause of morbidity worldwide according to the World Health Organization. Pharmaceutical treatment for depression is dominated by blockbuster brands, with the leading nine brands accounting for approximately 75% of total sales. However, the dominance of the leading brands is waning, largely due to the effects of patent expiration and generic competition. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Epilepsy - Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. These seizures are transient signs and/or symptoms of abnormal, excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, epilepsy affects 2.2 million Americans. Today, epilepsy is often controlled, but not cured, with medication that is categorized as older traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti-epileptic drugs. Because epilepsy afflicts sufferers in different ways, there is a need for drugs used in combination with both traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti-epileptic drugs. GBI Research estimates that the epilepsy market will increase to $4.5 billion by 2019. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Neuropathic Pain – We define neuralgia, or neuropathic pain, as pain that is not related to activation of pain receptor cells in any part of the body. Neuralgia is more difficult to treat than some other types of pain because it does not respond well to normal pain medications. Special medications have become more specific to neuralgia and typically fall under the category of membrane stabilizing drugs or antidepressants. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cancer
 

● | Malignant Melanoma - Predominantly a skin cancer, malignant melanoma can also occur in melanocytes found in the bowel and the eye. Malignant melanoma accounts for 75% of all deaths associated with skin cancer. The treatment includes surgical removal of the tumor, adjuvant treatment, chemo and immunotherapy, or radiation therapy. According to IMS Health the worldwide malignant melanoma market is expected to grow to $4.4 billion by 2022. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prostate Cancer – Specific to men, prostate cancer is a form of cancer that develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. The cancer cells may metastasize from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. Drug therapeutics for prostate cancer are expected to increase to nearly $18.6 billion in 2017 according to BCC Research. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pancreatic Cancer - Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the pancreas. In the United States, approximately 45,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer will be diagnosed this year and approximately 38,000 patients will die as a result of their cancer. Sales predictions by GBI Research forecast that the market for the pharmaceutical treatment of pancreatic cancer in the United States and five largest European countries will increase to $2.9 billion by 2021. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive.
 
At this time, our competitors are other biomedical development companies that are trying to discover and develop compounds to be used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other CNS diseases, and those companies already doing so. Those companies include Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), Axovant Sciences Ltd. (NYSE: AXON), Perrigo Company Plc (NYSE:PRGO), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Allergan Plc (NYSE:AGN), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), GlaxoSmithKline Plc (NYSE:GSK), Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE: LLY), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Roche Holding AG (VTX:ROG). For additional discussion of the risks related to competition, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
Patents, Trademarks and Intellectual Property 
 
Anavex holds ownership or exclusive rights to four U.S. patents and nine U.S. or PCT patent applications with various international counterpart applications, all of which relate to drug candidates and methods associated therewith. The most recent U.S. patent application was filed in September 2017. This patent, entitled “ANAVEX®2-73 and certain anticholinesterase inhibitors composition and method for neuroprotection” claims a composition of matter of ANAVEX®2-73 directed to a novel and synergistic neuroprotective compound combined with donepezil and other cholinesterase inhibitors.

We regard patents and other intellectual property rights as corporate assets. Accordingly, we attempt to optimize the value of intellectual property in developing our business strategy including the selective development, protection, and exploitation of our intellectual property rights. In addition to filings made with intellectual property authorities, we protect our intellectual property and confidential information by means of carefully considered processes of communication and the sharing of information, and by the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and provisions for the same in contractor’s agreements. While no agreement offers absolute protection, such agreements provide some form of recourse in the event of disclosure, or anticipated disclosure.
 
Our intellectual property position, like that of many biomedical companies, is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. For more information regarding challenges to our existing or future patents, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
 
Government Approval
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, and expected marketing of our potential drug compounds and in potential future research and development activities. The nature and extent to which such regulation will apply to us will vary depending on the nature of any potential drug compounds developed. We anticipate that all of our potential drug compounds will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization.
 
The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with the appropriate federal statutes and regulations requires substantial time and financial resources. For more information regarding the risks related to obtaining government approvals, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
 
The steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the United States, which are similar to steps required in most other countries, include:
 

● | non-clinical laboratory tests, non-clinical studies in animals, formulation studies and the submission to the FDA of an IND;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologic license application, or BLA, to the FDA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of potential drug compound chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies. The results of non-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. A 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND is required prior to commencement of clinical testing in humans. At any time during the 30-day period or at any time thereafter, the FDA may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials until the FDA authorizes trials under specified terms. The FDA may require additional animal testing after an initial IND is approved and prior to Phase III trials.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. During Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacological actions and safety, including side effects associated with increasing doses. Phase II usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications; assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
 
If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase I and II evaluations, Phase III trials are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
 
7


After successful completion of the required clinical trials, a NDA is generally submitted. The FDA may request additional information before accepting the NDA for filing, in which case the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA and responds to the applicant. The FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification often significantly extends the review process. The FDA may refer the NDA to an appropriate advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved, although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.
 
Under the United States Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug intended to treat a “rare disease or condition” as an “orphan drug.” A “rare disease or condition” is one which affects less than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects more than 200,000 people, but for which the cost of developing and making available the product is not expected to be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA or BLA is entitled to seven years of exclusive marketing rights in the United States unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of persons with the disease. However, orphan drug status is particular to the approved indication and does not prevent another company from seeking approval of an off-patent drug that has other labeled indications that are not under orphan or other exclusivities. Orphan drugs may also be eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated with the drugs’ development. In order to increase the development and marketing of drugs for rare disorders, regulatory bodies outside the United States have enacted regulations similar to the Orphan Drug Act.
 
Sales outside the United States of potential drug compounds we develop will also be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing for drugs. The requirements vary widely from country to country, but typically the registration and approval process takes several years and requires significant resources. In most cases, if the FDA has not approved a potential drug compound for sale in the United States, the potential drug compound may be exported for sale outside of the United States, only if it has been approved in any one of the following: the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, Switzerland and South Africa. There are specific FDA regulations that govern this process.
