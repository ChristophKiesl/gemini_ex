We also provide incident response activities with deep-dive network forensics and offer contextual information surrounding a specific alert or incident to enhance investigative capabilities and avoid false positives. 
Government Markets
While considered part of the enterprise vertical, we have built a strong position with federal, state and local government agencies, both in the United States and abroad. Similar to our enterprise customers, government agencies are focused on streamlining and transforming IT into more efficient and more easily managed environments. To accomplish this, agencies are turning to IT solutions that will help simplify managing and assuring their IT environments as well as reduce costs. However, governmental markets differ from enterprise markets primarily due to their purchasing cycles being influenced by potential changes in government administrators, budgetary priorities and allocated funding for key projects.
Telecommunication Service Provider Markets
Today’s service providers are focused on delivering a compelling set of services and ensuring a high-quality user experience, while also striving to minimize operational complexity and costs. This, coupled with the challenge of Internet Protocol (IP) transformation activities and emerging new technologies such as LTE, virtualization, IP-TV, wireless network (WiFi) and cloud services drives the need for a more automated and unified approach to managing service delivery and the subscriber experience. Service providers strive to reduce the cost of service delivery, address increasing complexity, scale their networks cost-effectively and adapt to emerging technologies such as cloud services, virtualization and 5G while assuring high-quality user experiences to retain their revenue base. Service providers are also seeking to gain greater insight into the subscriber experience in order to create upselling opportunities and improve retention. Additionally, service providers must protect their networks from high-volume, increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that consume bandwidth and potentially create outages that impact their business customers. 

• | For Mobile Operators – The fundamental transformation of the mobile network to all-IP enables mobile operators to build highly-scalable service delivery environments to offer new services to meet the growing subscriber demand for data, voice and video-centric services and to consolidate and simplify network operations. However, to capitalize fully on the value of IP and the significant market opportunities, mobile operators need detailed IP packet-level insight and core-to-access visibility. The addition of the former Tektronix Communications assets provides a broader range of capabilities that monitor radio access networks as well as powerful analytics that provide insight into subscriber trends and their customer experience.


• | For Fixed-line and Cable Operators – The growing demand for high-bandwidth triple-play services, broadband connectivity, content anywhere, IP-TV, on-demand video traffic, new extended WiFi initiatives and carrier Ethernet services presents service providers with significant revenue opportunities. IP has become the de facto convergence mechanism for access, distribution and core networks, enabling new service offerings and simplifying network operations while reducing total cost of operations. For example, cable operators use our solutions to monitor and manage their local area WiFi connectivity services as well as broadband and telephony services targeting small- and medium-sized businesses. To realize these benefits, operators need comprehensive insight into IP services, service usage, service availability, application awareness, traffic load, network availability and network performance.


• | For Internet Service Providers – Over the past decade, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including leading telecommunications providers, cable multi service operators and cloud providers, have seen significant increases in the sophistication, scale and frequency of high-volume and application-specific DDoS attacks, on their networks. DDoS attacks are aimed at disrupting the online services of an ISP’s business customer by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. Arbor Networks provides a wide range of ISPs around the world with solutions that help them protect their networks against DDoS attacks.

Arbor’s cybersecurity products. We expect to also continue to drive further penetration into our global service provider customer base. 

• | Increase market relevance and awareness – The Comms Transaction has substantially expanded our customer base around the world. NetScout will continue to implement marketing campaigns aimed at generating high-quality sales opportunities with both current and prospective enterprise and service provider customers, promoting thought leadership and building the NetScout brand.


• | Extend our technology partner alliance ecosystem – We plan to continue to develop and fortify alliances with complementary solutions providers that can help us support a larger, more global and more diverse customer base. We plan to continue to enhance our technology value, product capabilities and customer relevance through the continued integration of our products into technology partner products. This includes both interoperability integration efforts, as well as embedding our technology into alliance partner products to gain a more extensive footprint across both enterprise and service provider networks.


• | Pursue strategic acquisitions – We have completed many acquisitions since the Company’s inception that have helped broaden our capabilities, enhance our products and technologies, and better position the Company to meet the needs of a larger base of customers and prospects. In fiscal year 2017, we acquired the technology assets of Avvasi Incorporated (Avvasi), a specialist provider of award-winning solutions used by top-tier service providers to measure, improve and monetize video in their networks, regardless of whether that video traffic is encrypted. We plan to be opportunistic in pursuing strategic acquisitions in order to achieve key business and technology objectives.


• | Improve cost structure and drive efficiencies – We intend to continue to focus on directing investments into the key technology, product development, sales and marketing, and other initiatives that will enable us to drive long-term profitable growth. We believe that the Comms Transaction has created a range of opportunities to further improve the Company’s profitability. NetScout plans to generate gross margin synergies by driving product integration and extending its proven manufacturing techniques, and optimizing certain product lines. In addition, NetScout plans to integrate certain operations that have previously been managed separately across various business and product lines, consolidating back-office systems, and by continuing to eliminate or reduce redundancies associated with pre-existing resources, programs and capabilities. 

Support Services
Customer satisfaction is a key driver of NetScout’s success. NetScout’s support programs offer customers various levels of high quality support services to assist in the deployment and use of our solutions. We have support personnel strategically deployed across the globe to deliver 24/7 telephone support to our premium customers. Certain support services, such as on-site support activities, are provided by qualified third-party support partners. In addition, many of our certified resellers provide Partner Enabled Support to NetScout end users. This is especially prevalent in international locations where time zones and language, among other factors, make it more efficient for end users to have the reseller provide initial support functions. Our support also includes updates to our software and firmware at no additional charge, if and when such updates are developed and made generally available to our commercial customer base. If ordered, support commences upon expiration of the standard warranty for software. For software, which also includes firmware, the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires 60 to 90 days thereafter. With regard to hardware, the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires 60 days to 12 months thereafter. We believe our warranties are consistent with commonly accepted industry standards. NetScout will continue to provide support services for the acquired platforms under existing agreements and will explore opportunities to further simplify and standardize its support obligations over the coming years. 
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of final product assembly, configuration and testing. We purchase components and subassemblies from suppliers and construct our hardware products in accordance with NetScout standard specifications. We inspect, test and use process control to ensure the quality and reliability of our products. We maintain an ISO 9001 quality systems registration, a certification showing that our corporate procedures and manufacturing facilities comply with standards for quality assurance and process control. We also maintain an ISO 9001:2000 quality systems registration, a certification showing that our corporate procedures comply with standards for continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. Additionally, we have outsourced the manufacturing of certain acquired products to high-quality third-party contract manufacturers. 
Although we generally use standard parts and components for our products, which are available from various suppliers, each of the computer network interface cards used in our devices is currently available only from separate single source suppliers. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of components in a timely manner from current suppliers. While currently we purchase from specific suppliers, we believe that, in most cases, alternate suppliers could be identified if 
8

current suppliers are unable to fulfill our needs. Our reliance on single source suppliers is further described in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
We manufacture our products based upon near-term demand estimates resulting from sales forecasts and historical fulfillment information. Due to the fact that these forecasts have a high degree of variability because of such factors as time of year, overall economic conditions and sales employee incentives, we believe it is prudent to maintain inventory levels in advance of receipt of firm orders to ensure that we have sufficient stock to satisfy incoming orders.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We sell our products, support and services through a direct sales force and an indirect reseller and distribution channel.
 Our direct sales force uses a “high-touch” sales model that consists of face-to-face meetings with customers to understand and identify their unique business challenges and requirements. Our sales teams then translate those requirements into tailored business solutions that allow the customer to maximize the performance of its infrastructure and service delivery environment. Due to the complexity of the systems and the capital expenditure involved, our sales cycle typically takes three to twelve months. We build strategic relationships with our customers by continually enhancing our solution to help them address their evolving service delivery management challenges. In addition to providing a comprehensive solution to meet these needs, we continually provide software enhancements to our customers as part of their maintenance contracts with us. These enhancements are designed to provide additional and ongoing value to our existing customers to promote loyalty and the expansion of their deployment of our products. Existing customer growth is also driven by the expansion and changes in their networks as they add new infrastructure elements, new users, new locations, new applications and experience increasing service traffic volumes.
We also maintain an indirect reseller and distribution channel. Sales to customers outside the United States are primarily export sales through channel partners. Our channel partners assist us by improving our reach to customers, extending our presence in new markets, and marketing and selling our products to a broad array of organizations globally. We sell through a range of channel partners including value-added resellers, value-added distributors, resellers, and system integrators, to our enterprise, service provider and government customers. Historically and currently, we have used indirect distribution channels principally as intermediaries on contractual terms for customers with whom we do not have a contract. Our sales force meets with end user customers to present NetScout products and solutions, conduct demonstrations, provide evaluation equipment, recommend detailed product solutions, develop product deployment designs and timelines, and assist in establishing financial and other justifications for the proposed solution. During this selling process, a channel partner, who has contracts with both the end customer and NetScout, may be brought in to facilitate the transaction and to provide fulfillment services. In the case of international channel partners, those services usually also include currency translation and support. In the U.S., fulfillment services are usually limited to invoicing and cash collection. Under this approach, we have limited dependence upon channel partners for the major elements of the selling process. In many cases, there are multiple channel partners with the required contractual relationships, so dependence on any single channel partner is not significant.
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, one direct customer, Verizon Communications, Inc (Verizon), accounted for more than 10% of total revenue, while no indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, Verizon and one other direct customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue, while no indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. 
Marketing
Our marketing organization drives our market research, strategy, product positioning and messaging and produces and manages a variety of programs such as advertising, trade shows, industry events, public and analyst relations, social media, direct mail, seminars, sales promotions, and web marketing to promote the sale and acceptance of our solutions and to build the NetScout, ASI®, nGenius® and other applicable product brand names in the marketplace. We also host an annual worldwide user conference as a way to engage with existing customers, to provide education and awareness, and to promote expanded use of our software products with these customers. 
Key elements of our marketing strategy focus on thought leadership, market positioning, market education, go to market strategies, reputation management, demand generation, and the acceleration of our strategic selling relationships with local and global resellers, systems integrators, and our technology alliance partners. During fiscal year 2017, NetScout continued to advance campaigns to further fortify and amplify the NetScout and Arbor brands within their respective markets, as we phased out the use of certain acquired brand names. In addition, we continued efforts to increase the Company's visibility and broaden market awareness by executing on the aforementioned elements of our marketing strategy.

Research and Development
Our continued success depends significantly on our ability to anticipate and create solutions that will meet emerging customer requirements. NetScout works closely with its largest enterprise and service provider customers to better understand and address their near-term and longer-term requirements. By better understanding the key, time-sensitive needs of NetScout’s global customer base, NetScout’s development programs will continue to result in enhanced products that are able to meet the increasing challenges of an increasingly complex and dynamic global network environment.
We have invested significant financial resources and personnel into the development of our products and technology. Our continued investment in research and development is crucial to our business and our continued success in the market. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers with expertise in various technologies associated with our business and the technologies being deployed by our customers. We plan to continue to enhance and expand our product offerings and capabilities in the near future while integrating key capabilities from acquired product lines as appropriate. As a result, we plan to continue to invest and dedicate significant resources to our research and development activities for both our enterprise and service provider customers. 
We predominantly develop our products internally, with some limited third-party contracting. We have also acquired developed technology through business acquisitions. To promote industry standards and manifest technology leadership, we participate in and support the activities and recommendations of industry standards bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, and we also engage in close and regular dialogue with our key customers and alliance partners. These activities provide early insight into the direction of network and application performance requirements for current and emerging technologies.
Seasonality
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, quarterly variations in our order bookings as a result of a number of factors, including the length of the sales cycle, complexity of customer environments, new product introductions and their market acceptance and seasonal factors affected by customer projects and typical IT buying cycles. Due to these factors, we historically have experienced stronger bookings during our fiscal third and fourth quarters than in our first and second quarters. 
Customers
We sell our products to enterprises, service providers and governmental agencies with large- and medium-sized high-speed IP computer networks. Our enterprise customers cover a wide variety of industries, such as financial services, technology, manufacturing, healthcare, utilities, education, transportation and retail. In the telecommunications service provider customer group, we address mobile operators, wireline operators and cable operators. A significant number of our service provider customers are mobile operators.
Backlog
We produce our products on the basis of our forecast of near-term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers. We configure our products to customer specifications and generally deliver products shortly after receipt of the purchase order. Service engagements are also included in certain orders. Customers generally may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty. We believe that our backlog at any particular time is not meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Our combined product backlog at March 31, 2017 was $62.7 million compared to $125.7 million at March 31, 2016. A majority of the backlog relates to customization and integration projects from our acquired business units. In some cases, we have begun these projects but have not yet hit billable milestones. A majority of revenue for these projects is expected to be recognized into revenue throughout fiscal year 2018.
Competition
We compete with many companies in the markets we serve. The service assurance and performance management markets are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented with overlapping technologies and a wide range of competitors, both large and small, who may deliver certain elements of our solution. Consequently, there are a number of companies who have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. Additionally, certain competitors, either due to their size and resources or due to their technological strengths, may be able to respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements.
10

Principal competitive factors in our service assurance market include scalability; ability to address a large number of applications, locations and users; product performance; the ability to easily deploy into existing network environments; the ability to offer virtualized solutions; and the ability to administer and manage the solution.
While NetScout faces multiple competitors within the service assurance industry, we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the following factors:

• | We provide a comprehensive service delivery management solution that is capable of addressing the needs of both enterprise and service provider customers and can be scaled to meet the challenges of today’s dynamic service delivery environments;


• | We believe that our solutions provide superior data and compete favorably on a broad range of metrics including the ability to recognize and track a large number of applications;


• | We believe our solutions possess the scalability to support high and increasing levels of data and network traffic;


• | Our solutions look at both data and control plane traffic across an entire network;


• | Our ASI technology is optimized to provide real-time information about service performance and real-time alerts to emerging service problems whereas traditional solutions are inherently latent, supporting only forensic-trouble shooting after an issue has occurred.

In the enterprise market, our competitors include companies such as Avaya, CA Technologies, Cisco Systems, Dynatrace, ExtraHop, InfoVista, Keysight (which acquired Ixia in April 2017), Viavi, Gigamon, Lancope, New Relic, Riverbed Technology and SolarWinds. In addition, we both compete with and partner with large enterprise management vendors, such as HP and IBM, who offer performance management solutions.
In the service provider market, we compete with traditional probe vendors, network equipment manufacturers, big data and analytics vendors, and virtualization vendors. These vendors include Alcatel-Lucent, Astellia, Anritsu, Cisco, Empirix, Ericsson, Dell Technologies, EXFO, Guavas, Huawei, IBM, JDSU, Niksun, Polystar, Radcom, SevOne, Splunk, and Zettics. We face additional competitive threats from startups and new entrants that seek to offer innovative solutions in an industry characterized by rapid technological change.
In the cybersecurity market, we face a range of competitors, including those that may have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. We believe that our scalability of our solutions, flexible deployment, and price-performance of our cybersecurity solutions positions us well to compete against both larger network equipment and security companies and smaller niche security solutions vendors. 
In the DDoS solutions market, we compete with a broad range of vendors including Radware, Akamai, F5 Networks, A10 Networks, Fortinet and Corero Network Security. In the market for specialized threat analysis and protection solutions used to identify advanced network threats, we compete with a range of vendors including Darktrace, Vectra Networks, Cisco (via its late 2015 acquisition of Lancope), Palo Alto Networks (via its February 2017 acquisition of LightCyber) and other specialist providers.
Our ability to sustain a competitive advantage depends on our ability to deliver continued technology innovation and adapt to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Competitive factors in our industry are further described in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
