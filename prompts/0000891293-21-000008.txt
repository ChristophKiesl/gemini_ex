Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel targeted therapies for blood-related cancers that offer a unique benefit to patients and their healthcare providers. Our goal is to build a profitable company by generating income from products we develop and commercialize, either alone or with partners. We concentrate our efforts on treatments that target blood-related cancers where there is an unmet medical need. In particular, we are focused on evaluating pacritinib, our sole product candidate currently in active development, for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis. In addition, we have recently started developing pacritinib for use in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Pacritinib is an investigational oral kinase inhibitor with specificity for JAK2, IRAK1 and CSF1R. The JAK family of enzymes is a central component in signal transduction pathways, which are critical to normal blood cell growth and development, as well as inflammatory cytokine expression and immune responses. Mutations in these kinases have been shown to be directly related to the development of a variety of blood-related cancers, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia and lymphoma. In addition to myelofibrosis, the kinase profile of pacritinib suggests its potential therapeutic utility in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, prevention of graft versus host disease, or GvHD, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, due to its inhibition of JAK2, IRAK1, FLT3 and CSF1R. We believe pacritinib has the potential to be delivered as a single agent or in combination therapy regimens.
Our Strategy 
Our objective is to become a leader in the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for the treatment of blood-related cancers. The key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives are to:
•Develop Pacritinib in Myelofibrosis. We intend to develop and commercialize pacritinib for adult patients with myelofibrosis.
•Evaluate Strategic Product Collaborations to Accelerate Development and Commercialization. Where we believe it may be beneficial, we intend to evaluate additional collaborations to broaden and accelerate clinical trial development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Collaborations have the potential to generate non-equity based operating capital, supplement our own internal expertise and provide us with access to the marketing, sales and distribution capabilities of our collaborators in specific territories.
•Identify and Acquire Additional Pipeline Opportunities. Historically, we have built our candidate pipeline using multiple approaches, including through licensing and acquiring assets that we believe were initially undervalued opportunities. We plan to continue to seek out additional product candidates in an opportunistic manner.

The following table summarizes our current product and development portfolio as of the date of this report:
Oncology Market Overview and Opportunity 
According to the American Cancer Society, or ACS, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, resulting in more than 600,000 deaths annually, or more than 1,600 deaths per day. Approximately 1.9 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed in 2021 in the United States. While the exact prevalence of myelofibrosis is uncertain, a U.S. study presented at the 2012 American Society of Hematology reported a prevalence rate of 5.7 myelofibrosis cases per 100,000 people, indicating that there are approximately 17,000 myelofibrosis patients in the United States. The most commonly used methods for treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Patients usually receive a combination of these treatments depending upon the type and extent of their disease. 
We believe our expertise in blood-related cancers, together with our ability to identify unique therapies that address unmet medical needs that are potentially less toxic and more effective at treating and curing patients, may fill a significant unmet medical need for cancer patients.
Pacritinib
Overview
Pacritinib is an investigational oral kinase inhibitor with specificity for JAK2, IRAK1 and CSF1R. The JAK family of enzymes is a central component in signal transduction pathways, which are critical to normal blood cell growth and development, as well as inflammatory cytokine expression and immune responses. Mutations in these kinases have been shown to be directly related to the development of a variety of blood-related cancers, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia and lymphoma. In addition to myelofibrosis, the kinase profile of pacritinib suggests its potential therapeutic utility in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, prevention of graft versus host disease, or GvHD, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, due to its inhibition 
of JAK2, IRAK1, FLT3 and CSF1R. We believe pacritinib has the potential to be delivered as a single agent or in combination therapy regimens.
In September 2020, we reached an agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, for the potential accelerated approval of pacritinib as a treatment for myelofibrosis patients with severe thrombocytopenia, and in October 2020 we commenced our rolling NDA submission. The NDA is based on the available data from our completed Phase 3 PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2 trials and the Phase 2 PAC203 dose-ranging trial. Completion of the NDA submission is anticipated in the first quarter of 2021. The ongoing Phase 3 PACIFICA trial is expected to be completed as a post-marketing commitment.
PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2 Trials
Pacritinib was evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials, collectively known as the PERSIST program, for patients with myelofibrosis. The PERSIST-1 trial evaluated pacritinib in a broad set of patients without limitations on platelet counts, and the PERSIST-2 trial evaluated pacritinib in patients with low platelet counts. Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer associated with significantly reduced quality of life and shortened survival. As the disease progresses, the body slows production of important blood cells and within one year of diagnosis, the incidence of disease-related thrombocytopenia (very low blood platelet counts), severe anemia and red blood cell transfusion requirements increase significantly. Among other complications, most patients with myelofibrosis present with enlarged spleens (splenomegaly), as well as many other potentially devastating physical symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, bone pain, feeling full after eating little, severe itching, night sweats and extreme fatigue. Currently patients with very low blood platelets, so called severe thrombocytopenia, (<50,000/µL) have limited or no effective treatment options. Myelofibrosis patients with severe thrombocytopenia have poor survival following discontinuation of therapy with the approved JAK1/JAK2 therapy. We believe pacritinib may offer effective treatment of splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. 
PERSIST-1 was a randomized (2:1), open-label, multi-center Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pacritinib compared to BAT excluding JAK inhibitors, in 327 patients with myelofibrosis, without exclusion for low platelet counts. 
In May 2015, data from PERSIST-1 showed that compared to BAT (exclusive of a JAK inhibitor) pacritinib therapy resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients with SVR and control of disease-related symptoms meeting the primary endpoint of the trial. Additionally, 25 percent of patients treated with pacritinib who were severely anemic and transfusion dependent - requiring at least six units of blood in the 90 days prior to study entry - became transfusion independent, compared to zero patients treated with BAT (p<0.05). The most common adverse events, occurring in 10 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were: mild to moderate diarrhea, nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia and vomiting. Of the patients treated with pacritinib, three discontinued therapy and 13 patients required dose interruption (average one week) for diarrhea. Patients received a daily full dose of pacritinib over the duration of treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms typically lasted for approximately one week and few patients discontinued treatment due to side effects. There were no Grade 4 gastrointestinal events reported. 
The PERSIST-2 trial was a randomized (2:1), open-label, multi-center registration-directed Phase 3 trial evaluating pacritinib compared to BAT, including the approved JAK inhibitor dosed according to product label, for patients with myelofibrosis whose platelet counts are less than or equal to 100,000 per microliter (≤100,000/µL). The PERSIST-2 trial met one of the co-primary endpoints showing a statistically significant SVR in patients treated with pacritinib combining the once- and twice-daily arms compared to BAT. The PERSIST-2 trial did not meet the other co-primary endpoint of greater than 50 percent reduction in TSS. Although secondary objectives could not be evaluated formally due to the study not achieving one of the primary objectives, when the two pacritinib dosing arms were evaluated separately versus BAT, pacritinib given twice daily showed a higher percent of SVR and TSS responses compared to BAT; whereas, pacritinib given once daily showed only a higher percent SVR responses compared to BAT. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in 20 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were gastrointestinal (generally manageable diarrhea, nausea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia) and were generally less frequent for BID versus QD administration. The most common serious treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence of ≥5 percent reported in any treatment arm irrespective of grade) were anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia and acute renal failure none of which exceeded 8 percent individually in any arm. 
In February 2015, we received a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, in place at the time to terminate the PERSIST-1 trial and hold enrollment of new patients in the PERSIST-2 trial. The IDMC’s recommendation was based on non-statistically significant safety concerns, including mortality, in patients on pacritinib, particularly those who crossover after 24 weeks. On February 8, 2016, the FDA notified us that a full clinical hold had been placed on pacritinib clinical studies.
PAC203 Trial
In January 2017, the FDA removed the full clinical hold following review of our complete response submission which included, among other items, final Clinical Study Reports for both PERSIST-1 and -2 trials and a dose-exploration clinical trial protocol that the FDA requested. At that time, the PAC203 trial was designed to enroll up to approximately 105 patients with primary myelofibrosis and who had failed prior ruxolitinib therapy across three dose regimens of pacritinib, 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID, to evaluate the dose response relationship for safety and efficacy (SVR at 12 and 24 weeks). The 200 mg BID dose was selected as the top dose based upon observations from the completed PERSIST-2 study. In PAC203, the entry criteria were modified to exclude patients with a history of cardiac and/or bleeding events and additional dose modification guidelines were implemented for the management of treatment-emergent cardiac and or bleeding events. The first patient in the PAC203 trial was enrolled in July 2017. 
In April 2018, we amended the protocol to expand the sample size to a maximum of 150 patients (or 50 patients per arm) to collect additional data for the safety and efficacy analyses. In July 2018, we announced that the IDMC for the PAC203 trial completed its planned interim data review of the PAC203 trial and that the IDMC did not identify any drug- or dose-related safety concerns and did not identify any concerns about cardiac or bleeding events. Following meetings with the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and consultation with the IDMC, we eliminated the interim efficacy analysis and focused the second interim data review, and all subsequent data reviews, on an assessment of safety. The protocol was amended to reflect this change and submitted to FDA. In October 2018, we announced the continuation of the PAC203 Phase 2 study without modification, following a planned second interim data review by the IDMC. The IDMC did not identify significant drug- or dose-related safety concerns and specifically did not identify any concerns around hemorrhagic or cardiac toxicity. A complete dataset from the fully enrolled study (including efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data) will be used to determine the optimal dose of pacritinib for further clinical development, as requested by the FDA. The PAC203 study was fully enrolled in December 2018. In January 2019, the IDMC completed its planned third interim safety review and recommended that the study continue without modification. 
In December 2019, we announced top-line efficacy and safety data for the PAC203 trial. Pacritinib was shown to be generally well tolerated across dosing cohorts. The majority of non-hematological adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and, with the exception of diarrhea, were considered unlikely related to pacritinib. The most common non-hematologic adverse events were gastrointestinal, including diarrhea (23.6%) and nausea (23.6%), and occurred more commonly in patients treated at 200 mg BID (31/54, 57.4%) than at lower doses (100 mg BID: 23/55, 41.8%, 100 mg QD: 22/52, 42.3%). These events were largely grade 1 or 2 in severity. Diarrhea was generally manageable with standard antidiarrheal agents, and only one patient (at 200mg BID) required drug discontinuation due to any gastrointestinal event (diarrhea). 
The most common hematologic adverse events were thrombocytopenia and anemia, both occurring at higher frequencies at the 200 mg BID dose (35.2 percent and 24.1 percent respectively); this did not, however, lead to higher rates of Grade 3/4 hemorrhage at higher doses (200 mg BID: 5.6 percent; 100 mg BID: 0 percent; 100 mg QD: 7.7 percent; all Grade 3). Similarly, the highest dose saw no excess in Grade 3/4 cardiac (200 mg BID: 3.7 percent; 100 mg BID: 7.3 percent; 100 mg QD: 5.8; all grade 3). There were 10 Grade 5 (fatal) adverse events: 3 at 200 mg BID (sepsis, respiratory failure, subdural hematoma), 3 at 100 mg BID (disease progression, subdural hemorrhage, heart failure), and 4 at 100 mg QD (disease progression, general physical health deterioration, sepsis, tuberculosis).
The 200 mg BID arm had the highest observed rates of SVR ≥35 percent (200 mg BID: 9.3 percent; 100 mg BID: 1.8 percent; 100 mg QD: 0.0 percent). Of the 5 patients with SVR ≥35 percent at the 200 mg BID dose, 4 had platelet counts <50,000/µL, representing a 17 percent (4/24) response rate among patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Though a dose response relationship was not observed in total symptom score (TSS) based on the threshold of 50 percent reduction in symptom score, the median percent decrease in TSS (including fatigue) did show deeper reductions with escalating doses, with best response at 200 mg BID. At Week 24, the percent change in TSS from baseline was highest in the 200 mg pacritinib BID group (median ‑27.3%) compared with the other treatment groups (100 mg pacritinib BID group: median ‑16.0%; 100 mg pacritinib QD group: median ‑3.1%). Of the TSS (including fatigue) responders, baseline cytopenias were common: 8 of 12 had hemoglobin <10g/dL, and 4 of 12 had platelet counts <50,000/µL.
PACIFICA Phase 3 Trial
In June 2019, we attended a Type B meeting with the FDA to review the results of the PAC203 study. Based on FDA feedback at that meeting, we designed a randomized Phase 3 study of pacritinib to compare the safety and efficacy of 200 mg BID of pacritinib to Physician's Choice in adult myelofibrosis patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 
50,000 per microliter) an indication that has been recognized by the FDA as an important unmet serious medical need. In July 2019, we received scientific advice from the EMA on the study’s design. 
The selection of the 200 mg BID dose and dosing schedule for the Phase 3 study was determined using the results of the PAC203 study together with dose- and exposure-response analyses using all available data from pacritinib clinical trial. In July 2019, a draft protocol for that Phase 3 study was submitted to the FDA and we received their feedback on the design in September 2019 and October 2019, which included a suggestion that we amend the design to include change in total symptom score, or TSS, as a co-primary endpoint. We completed a Type C meeting with the FDA in December 2019 and received additional input from the FDA on key elements of the design of the Phase 3 study including changes that could allow for an accelerated approval NDA filing and that we would power the study for TSS but it would remain a secondary endpoint. 
In January 2020, we received the FDA's preliminary comments from a Type A meeting request and reached an agreement on the final design changes to our PACIFICA pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, including changes to the statistical analysis plan that would allow for an accelerated approval pathway for pacritinib. We have amended our PACIFICA Phase 3 trial protocol, to allow for the primary analysis of Spleen Volume Reduction, or SVR, rate on the first 168 patients, with an end-of-study analysis of Total Symptom Score, or TSS, and Overall Survival, or OS, following the full enrollment of 348 patients. We previously anticipated reporting primary SVR data by the end of 2021 with final study efficacy data expected in 2023; however, as a result of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic known as COVID-19, we currently anticipate a lower enrollment rate than planned and at least a nine-month delay in the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial timeline.
PRE-VENT Phase 3 Trial
In April 2020, in response to the public health crisis due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated PRE-VENT, a Phase 3 trial evaluating pacritinib in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. PRE-VENT, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study will compare pacritinib plus Standard of Care, or SOC, versus placebo plus SOC in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, including those with a current or prior diagnosis of cancer. The primary endpoint of the trial will assess the proportion of patients who progress to invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or die by Day 28. We commenced enrollment of PRE-VENT in the second quarter of 2020 in the United States and currently anticipate the reporting of interim analysis from the PRE-VENT trial in mid-2021. 
Patients enrolled in PRE-VENT will be randomized 1:1 to receive pacritinib (400 mg once on Day 1, then 200 mg twice daily from Day 2 to Day 14) plus SOC or placebo plus SOC. Assigned treatment will continue up to Day 14 or until the patient experiences intolerable adverse events, withdraws consent, initiates another investigational therapy or until the study is terminated. Assigned therapy may be given for an additional seven days (for a total of 21 days) at the discretion of the investigator and with medical monitor approval. In the event of hospital discharge, patients will complete treatment with the assigned therapy as an outpatient.
As a JAK2, IRAK1 and CSF1R inhibitor, pacritinib may ameliorate the effects of cytokine storm, a pathological immune reaction that can be triggered by viral infection and can lead to serious complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. Multiple inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in patients with severe COVID-19, including IL-1 and IL-6, and some patients have evidence of over-active macrophage activation. As a JAK2/IRAK1 inhibitor, pacritinib may ameliorate the effects of cytokine storm via inhibition of IL-6 and IL-1 signaling. Furthermore, as a CSF1R inhibitor, pacritinib may mitigate effects of macrophage activation syndrome. 
Development in Other Indications 
In December 2014, we announced results of a preclinical analysis of kinase inhibition by pacritinib that demonstrated a unique kinome profile among agents in development for myelofibrosis and suggests potential therapeutic benefit across a broad spectrum of blood-related cancers. Pacritinib’s potent inhibition of IRAK1 and CSF1R highlight its potential therapeutic utility in other diseases, such as MDS, CLL, GvHD, autoimmune diseases and breast cancer, some of which are currently being evaluated in investigator sponsored trials, or ISTs.
In December 2020, results from an IST evaluating pacritinib’s ability to prevent GvHD were presented in an oral presentation at the American Society for Hematology conference. In this study, pacritinib was administered in combination with sirolimus and tacrolimus to patients who had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies, which resulted in a significant reduction in the expected acute GvHD rates in patients within the first 100 days of therapy as compared to historical data. The Phase I portion of the study identified a biologically active and safe dose of pacritinib (100 mg twice daily) for use in this indication and showed preliminary evidence of efficacy in prevention of GvHD without compromising transplant outcomes and without any new safety concerns. Enrollment in Phase II of the study is ongoing. 
In October 2016, we regained worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of pacritinib following termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement with Baxalta. For additional information relating to the termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement, see “License Agreements - Baxalta” below. 
License Agreements 
Baxalta
In November 2013, we entered into a Development, Commercialization and License Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2013, with Baxter International Inc., or Baxter, for the development and commercialization of pacritinib for use in oncology and potentially additional therapeutic areas, or the Pacritinib License Agreement, which was subsequently amended in June 2015. Baxter assigned its rights and obligations under the Pacritinib License Agreement to Baxalta. Under the Pacritinib License Agreement, we granted to Baxter an exclusive, worldwide (subject to co-promotion rights discussed below), royalty-bearing, non-transferable, and (under certain circumstances outside of the United States) sub-licensable license to our know-how and patents relating to pacritinib.
In October 2016, we entered into the Asset Return and Termination Agreement, or the Baxalta Termination Agreement, with Baxalta. Pursuant to the Baxalta Termination Agreement, the Pacritinib License Agreement was terminated in its entirety (other than with respect to certain customary provisions that survive termination, including those pertaining to confidentiality and indemnification), the Pacritinib License Agreement has no further force or effect, and all rights and obligations of the Company and Baxalta under the Pacritinib License Agreement were terminated.
In October 2016, we resumed primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the Baxalta Termination Agreement and are no longer eligible to receive cost sharing or milestone payments for pacritinib’s development from Baxalta. 
Pursuant to the Baxalta Termination Agreement, we are required to make a milestone payment to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, in the amount of approximately $10.3 million upon the first regulatory approval or any pricing and reimbursement approvals of a product containing pacritinib. Baxalta was acquired by Shire plc in 2016, and Shire plc was subsequently acquired by Takeda in 2019. 
S*BIO
We acquired the compounds SB1518 (which is referred to as “pacritinib”) and SB1578, which inhibit JAK2 and FLT3, from S*BIO in May 2012. Under our agreement with S*BIO, we are required to make milestone payments to S*BIO up to an aggregate amount of $132.5 million if certain U.S., EU and Japanese regulatory approvals are obtained and if certain worldwide net sales thresholds are met in connection with any pharmaceutical product containing or comprising any compound that we acquired from S*BIO for use for specific diseases, infections or other conditions. At our election, we may pay up to 50 percent of any milestone payments to S*BIO through the issuance of shares of our common stock or shares of our preferred stock convertible into our common stock. In addition, S*BIO will be entitled to receive royalty payments from us at incremental rates in the low single-digits based on certain worldwide net sales thresholds on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis.
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
In June 2005, we entered into an acquisition agreement with Cephalon, Inc., or Cephalon, pursuant to which we divested the compound, TRISENOX. Cephalon was subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva. Under this agreement, we have the right to receive up to $100 million in payments upon achievement by Teva of specified sales and development milestones related to TRISENOX. To date, we have received $60.0 million of such potential milestone payments as a result of having achieved certain sales milestones.
Other Agreements
We have several agreements with clinical research organizations, or CROs, third-party manufacturers and distributors that have durations of greater than one year for the development and distribution of certain of our compounds.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights 
We dedicate significant resources to protecting our intellectual property, which is important to our business. We have filed numerous patent applications in the United States and various other countries seeking protection of inventions originating from our research and development, and we have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties and through acquisitions. We have pending patent applications or issued patents in the United States and foreign countries directed to pacritinib and other product candidates. Patents for the individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
Our U.S. and foreign composition of matter patents for pacritinib expire as follows: U.S. patents expire in May 2028 (method) / January 2029 (compound) / March 2030 (salt); foreign patents expire in November 2026 (method and compound) / December 2029 (salt). We expect our U.S. and foreign patent applications for use of pacritinib for treating transplant rejection will expire in 2036. 
Each patent may be eligible for future patent term restoration of up to five years under certain circumstances. Also, regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection of clinical data may be complementary to patent protection. During a period of regulatory exclusivity, competitors generally may not use the original applicant’s data as the basis for a generic application. In the United States, the data protection generally runs for five years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity, extended to seven years for an orphan drug indication. Pacritinib has orphan drug designation for myelofibrosis in the United States and the European Union. 
In addition to our patent rights, we rely, to the extent possible, on trade secrets and contractual protections for our know-how and other unpatented technology. Ultimately, to the extent any of our product candidates are not protected by patent rights, our competitors would be free to use inventions embodied in our product candidates to which they have access to compete with us.
The risks and uncertainties associated with our intellectual property, including our patents, are discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Manufacturing, Distribution and Associated Operations
Our manufacturing strategy utilizes third party contractors for the procurement and manufacture, as applicable, of raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product, as well as for labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of our compounds and associated supply chain operations. As our clinical development activities continue to expand, we expect that our manufacturing, distribution and related operational requirements will increase correspondingly. Additionally, in October 2016, we resumed primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement. The development and commercialization of a major product candidate like pacritinib without a collaborative partner has significantly increased our manufacturing, distribution and related operational requirements, and we expect such increases to continue as we advance the clinical development of pacritinib.
Each third party contractor undergoes a formal qualification process by our subject matter experts prior to our entry into any service agreement and initiating any manufacturing work. We currently have a commercial supply arrangement for pacritinib.
Integral to our manufacturing strategy is our quality control and quality assurance program, which includes standard operating procedures and specifications with the goal that our compounds are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and other applicable global regulations. The cGMP compliance includes strict adherence to regulations for quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities for products and product candidates must meet cGMP requirements, and commercialized products must have acquired FDA, EMA and any other applicable regulatory approval. In this regard, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our compounds in accordance with cGMPs for use in clinical trials and distribution.
We believe our operational strategy of utilizing qualified outside vendors in the foregoing manner allows us to direct our financial and managerial resources to development and commercialization activities, rather than to the establishment and maintenance of a manufacturing and distribution infrastructure.
Competition 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. We face competition from a variety of companies focused on developing oncology drugs. We compete with large pharmaceutical companies and with other specialized biotechnology companies. In addition to the specific competitive factors discussed below, new anti-cancer drugs that may be developed and marketed in the future could compete with our various compounds.
Pacritinib may face competition from the currently approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, Jakafi® / Jakavi® (ruxolitinib) and Inrebic® (fedratinib). In August 2019, Celgene (which was subsequently acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb) announced FDA approval of Inrebic® for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis, and in February 2021 Bristol Myers Squibb announced the European Commission approval of Inrebic®. Pacritinib may also face competition from momelotinib, which Sierra Oncology acquired from Gilead. In June 2019, Sierra Oncology announced that momelotinib was granted fast track designation by the FDA and launched a Phase 3 clinical trial in November 2019. In addition, if we are successful in bringing pacritinib to market as a treatment to prevent progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, and medical ventilation, we expect to face competition from numerous other companies that are currently pursuing clinical development programs for COVID-19 and related conditions.
Some of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of these competitors have products that have been approved or are in development and operate large, well-funded research and development programs.
Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage if their products work through a similar mechanism as our products and if the approved indications are similar. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new products for the treatment of the same diseases being targeted by us. In some instances, such products have already entered late-stage clinical trials or received FDA or European Commission approval. However, cancer drugs with distinctly different mechanisms of action are often used together in combination for treating cancer, allowing several different products to target the same cancer indication or disease type. Such combination therapy is typically supported by clinical trials that demonstrate the advantage of combination therapy over that of a single-agent treatment.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology, develop proprietary products, attract and retain scientific personnel, obtain patent or other protection for our products, obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our products, either alone or through outside parties. We will continue to seek licenses with respect to technology related to our field of interest and may face competition with respect to such efforts. See the risk factor, “We face direct and intense competition from our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may not compete successfully against them.” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties we face due to competition in our industry. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. In addition to FDA regulation, we are also subject to additional legal and regulatory requirements at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union are addressed in a centralized way through the EMA and the European Commission, but country-specific regulation by the competent authorities of the EU member states remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, including through review and approval of NDAs. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant. There are also additional laws and regulations, administered by the FDA and other government agencies, that are applicable to the development, approval, manufacture, marketing, promotion, sale, pricing and distribution of drugs.
Drug Development
Preclinical Testing. Before testing any compound in human subjects in the United States, a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.
IND Application. Human clinical trials in the United States cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND application, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND application becomes effective 30 calendar days following its receipt by the FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, the FDA may stop the clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and GCP requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is reviewed by the FDA as part of the IND application. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board, or IRB, at the institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial and timely reporting adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND application must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND application may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
A study sponsor is required to submit certain details about active clinical trials and clinical trial results to the National Institutes of Health for public posting on http://clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another:
•Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop data regarding the product’s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
•Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product, at the proposed dosing regimen.
The sponsoring company, the FDA or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
The FDA and IND application sponsor may agree in writing on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA application. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. These agreements may not be changed after the clinical trials begin, except in limited circumstances. The existence of a SPA, however, does not assure approval of a product candidate. For additional information relating to drug development, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Drug Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the investigational product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial review user fee to the FDA. The FDA will review the application and may deem it to be inadequate to support commercial marketing, and there can be no assurance that any product approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also seek the advice of an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians practicing in the field for which the product is intended, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee. We are not permitted to market our drugs in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA.
The FDA has various programs, including breakthrough therapy, fast track, priority review and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for one or more of these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. We cannot be sure that any of our drugs will qualify for any of these programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, the review time will be reduced or the product will be approved.
Before approving a NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities where the product is manufactured, tested and distributed and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities as acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy, or impose other post-approval commitment conditions.

In some circumstances, post-marketing testing may include post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, which are used primarily to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended population, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In addition, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. A REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk mitigation tools.
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical trials be conducted. For additional information relating to drug development, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Post-Approval FDA Requirements
Holders of an approved NDA are required to: (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing and distribution facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production, quality control and distribution to maintain cGMP compliance. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing facilities that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical holds, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplemental applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. For additional information relating to post-approval requirements, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Advertising and Promotion
Under the FDCA and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses, or uses not approved by the FDA. This means that in the U.S., we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the uses of our products that are not approved by the FDA, unless otherwise allowed by the FDA by policy or other guidance. Marketing of prescription drugs is also subject to additional laws and regulations through federal and state agencies tasked with consumer protection. After approval in the U.S., we must comply with these law and regulations, as well as FDA’s regulation of drug promotion and advertising, including restrictions on off-label promotion. For additional information relating to restrictions related to advertising and promotion, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse
If we receive approval for one or more of our products in the United States, our operations and business arrangements with third-parties (including but not limited to researchers, healthcare professionals, consultants, payors, and customers) will be subject to additional healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by federal and state governments in the United States. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws. 
Anti-Kickback Laws
The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits companies and individuals from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or reward referrals of business that will be paid for by federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We are also required to comply with other state anti-kickback statutes and other limitations on gifts and payments to physicians and reporting of payments to certain third parties, among other requirements. Failure to abide by anti-kickback statutes can result in civil and criminal enforcement actions and/or sanctions. Likewise, federal and state false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act and similar state statutes, prohibit knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, false claims or false or fraudulent statements material to a false claim to government health care programs. Pharmaceutical companies are frequent targets of false claims lawsuits, which may result in treble damages, penalties, and potential exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, and civil monetary penalty statutes often overlap and may also be enforced in conjunction. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to these laws. For additional information relating to our obligations under health care fraud and abuse laws, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission jointly enforce the FCPA, and those agencies have, in recent years, emphasized FCPA enforcement against pharmaceutical companies. 
In some countries, we may interact with health care professionals or other officials that meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. We are subject to the FCPA’s prohibitions against unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees or agents. If we were determined to have violated the FCPA, we could be subject to substantial fines, penalties, and other legal or equitable sanctions. For additional information relating to our obligations under the FCPA and anti-bribery laws, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Third-Party Reimbursement
The coverage and reimbursement status of our products, if and when approved, is subject to significant uncertainty. Sales of and revenue from our products will depend on coverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors, including government health programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our products can be subject to challenge, reduction, or denial by payors. Government health programs, private insurers, are increasingly trying to reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals, and any future legislative, regulatory, or contractual developments could affect the coverage and reimbursement status of our products, if and when approved. For additional information relating to product reimbursement, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Data Privacy and Protection
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and implementing regulations, create requirements relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA regulations govern the manner in which certain health information may be used and disclosed, and require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA and HITECH requirements are applicable to covered entities, which are (1) health plans, (2) health care clearinghouses, and (3) health care providers who electronically transmit certain health information. Those requirements are also applicable, in many instances, to business associates of covered entities. In some cases, depending on our business operations and contractual agreements, including through the conduct of clinical trials, we are subject to HIPPA requirements. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines, penalties, damages, loss of goodwill or business opportunities, and reputational harm. There are also additional federal, state, and local privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. that may apply to us now or in the future and that require that we take measures to protect the privacy and security of certain information we gather and use in our business. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The law requires businesses collecting information about California consumers to disclose what personal information is collected about a consumer and the purposes for which that personal information is used, disclose what personal information is sold or shared for a business purpose, and to whom, and delete information or stop selling such information upon request (subject to exceptions). For additional information relating to our obligations under data privacy laws, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Non-U.S. Regulation 
Before our medicinal products can be marketed outside of the United States, they must be subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials, product licensing, safety reporting, post-authorization requirements, marketing and promotion, interactions with healthcare professionals, pricing and reimbursement may vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product.
Conduct of clinical trials in the European Union
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or the Clinical Trials Directive, has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Clinical Trials Directive in a manner that is not always uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. The European Union has, therefore, adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation. The Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the European Union, including a new coordinated 
procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The effectiveness of the Clinical Trials Regulation has been postponed several times due to technical difficulties with the underlying IT systems that are still ongoing. Currently it is expected to become effective in December 2021.
Clinical trials must currently be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Clinical Trials Directive and applicable good clinical practice standards, as implemented into national legislation by the individual EU Member States. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted by two separate entities: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and to the Ethics Committees of the EU Member State where they occur.
In the European Union, pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or deferral or waiver, must be approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, prior to submission of a marketing authorization application to the EMA or to the competent authorities of the EU Member States; an application must include the results of studies as described in an approved PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. In most EU countries, companies are also required to have an approved PIP before enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial.
Marketing authorization procedures in the European Union and post-marketing obligations

In the European Union, medicinal products may only be placed on the market after a related marketing authorization, or MA, has been granted. Marketing authorizations for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. These are through the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure, the decentralized procedure, or a national procedure (for medicinal products sold in a single EU Member State only). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and certain other new medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases. It is optional for medicinal products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and for medicinal products that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations, or for which grant of a marketing authorization through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of patients or animal health at EU level. The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the EMA which will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. Based on the positive opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, at EMA, the European Commission has final authority for granting the marketing authorization within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion to grant a centralized marketing authorization which is valid in all 28 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).

The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization to the competent authorities in several EU Member States simultaneously for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where the competent authority of an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies, or CMDh, for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States. The national marketing authorization procedure is founded on the same basic EU regulatory process as the other marketing authorization procedures discussed herein. The national marketing authorization procedure, which is increasingly rare, permits a company to submit an application to the competent authority of a single EU Member State and, if successful, to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid only in this EU Member State.
The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application in the European Union is 210 days, subject to extension if additional questions need to be addressed. The initial marketing authorization granted in the European Union is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and remain valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five year renewal period; applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
Similar to accelerated approval regulations in the United States, conditional marketing authorizations can be granted in the European Union by the European Commission in exceptional circumstances. A conditional marketing authorization can be granted for medicinal products where, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, a number of criteria are fulfilled; i) the benefit/risk balance of the product is positive, ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data, iii) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled by the grant of the marketing authorization and iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization must be renewed annually. Under the provisions of the conditional marketing authorization for PIXUVRI, our former product candidate, we were required to complete a post-marketing Phase 3 study to further investigate the effects of using PIXUVRI in a defined group of patients who had received prior treatment with rituximab. We submitted the related clinical study report to the EMA in November 2018. 
In the European Union, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier and which do not fall within the scope of the concept of global marketing authorization qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and ten years of market exclusivity. The eight years' data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data in assessing an application for authorization of a generic or biosimilar medicinal product for eight years from the data of authorization of the innovative product. After this period has expired a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application may be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced in the application. However, even if the generic product or biosimilar products is authorized it cannot be marketed in the European Union during the ten year marketing exclusivity period. This market exclusivity period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Pricing and reimbursement in the European Union
Even if a product is subject to a marketing authorization in the European Union, there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such product will be secured on a timely basis or at all. The EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product. Alternatively, it may adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. 
In a number of EU Member States we may be subject to cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted; ultimately, HTA measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health technologies assessment. This legislative proposal is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal provides that EU Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the European Union, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States, but there can be no assurance that the draft HTA regulation will not have effects on pricing and reimbursement decisions.
Therefore, we will need to expend significant effort and expense to establish and maintain reimbursement arrangements in the various countries comprising the European Union and may never succeed in obtaining widespread reimbursement arrangements therein.
Post-Approval Regulation
Similar to the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of individual EU Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These rules can impose on holders of marketing authorization granted through the centralized marketing authorization procedure the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed medicinal products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies or post-authorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine's safety, or to measure the effectiveness of risk-management measures, which may be time consuming and expensive and could impact our profitability. Marketing authorization holders are required to prepare Periodic Safety Update Reports in relation to medicinal products for which they hold marketing authorizations. The EMA reviews Periodic Safety Update Reports for medicinal products authorized through the centralized procedure. If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing marketing authorization for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied. The Agency can advise that the marketing authorization holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase IV safety studies. The EMA opinion is submitted to the European Commission for its consideration. If the Commission agrees with the opinion, it can adopt a decision varying the existing marketing authorization. Failure by the marketing authorization holder to fulfill the obligations for which the European Commission's decision provides can undermine the on-going validity of the marketing authorization.
More generally, non-compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorization for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures. 
The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the European Union is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the European Union is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States.
We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to cGMP, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping, and quality standards as defined by the EMA, the European Commission, the competent authorities of EU Member States and other regulatory authorities. Companies may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions. These include suspension of manufacturing authorization in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States’ requirements governing the manufacturing of medicinal products.
Sales and Marketing Regulations
In the European Union, the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The applicable laws at EU level and in the individual EU Member 
States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010.
Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct developed at both EU level and in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States also must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Data Privacy and Protection 
Data protection laws and regulations have been adopted at the EU level with related implementing laws in individual EU Member States which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which entered into force in May 2018, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting and provides for significant monetary and other sanctions in the case of non-compliance.
As the General Data Protection Regulation entered into force recently, guidance on implementation and compliance practices are still being developed, updated or otherwise revised. Although the General Data Protection Regulation is intended to provide for a high level of harmonization across the EU, Member States may still implement certain variations, and data protection authorities may enforce the General Data Protection Regulation and national laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union.
Furthermore, there is a trend towards the public disclosure of clinical trial data in the European Union which also adds to the complexity of processing health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation (which is replacing the EU Clinical Trials Directive), EMA disclosure initiatives, and voluntary commitments by industry, among other sources. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government investigations, enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm to our reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks, such as the Clinical Trials Regulation and the General Data Protection Regulation, further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to data protection regulation.
Consequences of Non-Compliance
Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical holds, refusal of regulatory authorities to approve or authorize pending product applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, financial penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
Environmental Regulation
In connection with our research and development activities, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies, both internationally and domestically, governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes and employee safety and health matters. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to take any significant action to correct any noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research 
and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, certain hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with applicable law and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability not covered by insurance could exceed our resources.
