Overview of Our Company and Business Strategy
We are the leader and innovator in healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services in the United States. Our mission is to deliver the best talent and insights to help healthcare organizations optimize their workforce, provide healthcare professionals opportunities to do their best work toward quality patient care, and create a values-based culture of innovation in which our team members can achieve their goals. As the leader and innovator in workforce solutions, we enable our clients to optimize their workforce to successfully reduce staffing complexity, increase efficiency and enhance the patient experience. Through our comprehensive suite of solutions we provide technology, analytics, and services to build and manage all or a portion of our clients’ healthcare workforce needs, from nurses, doctors, and allied health professionals to healthcare leaders and executives, both on a temporary and permanent basis.
Over the past several years, we have evolved from a traditional healthcare staffing provider into a strategic healthcare workforce solutions partner to our clients. We expanded our portfolio to serve a diverse and growing set of talent-related needs. 
1


This includes managed services programs (MSP), vendor management systems (VMS), predictive analytics, workforce optimization consulting, recruitment process outsourcing (RPO), permanent placement, interim and executive leadership, and remote medical coding. Our clients look to us to help them build and develop high quality, flexible workforces that deliver great outcomes and an engaged patient experience. Our network of talented clinicians and leaders trusts us to ensure we find them a great fitting team and environment that helps them grow and leverage their skills and expertise. 
When expanding our services and products, we consider the following key criteria: (1) addressing the most pressing current and future needs of our customers, (2) alignment with our core operations, expertise, and access to healthcare professionals, (3) strengthening and broadening of our client relationships, (4) reduction in exposure to economic cycles and (5) enhancement of our long-term sustainable, differentiated business model. To supplement our clinical staffing solutions, we have expanded our suite of offerings to include MSP and RPO offerings. Since 2010, we have supplemented, developed or acquired the following offerings:


• | Managed Services Programs. We acquired Medfinders, one of the nation’s leading providers of clinical workforce MSP, accelerating our growth in this area and clearly establishing AMN Healthcare as the nation’s largest provider of clinical workforce management solutions.


• | Vendor Management Systems. Through our acquisitions of ShiftWise and Medefis, we offer two industry-leading SaaS-based, vendor neutral management systems, which allows our clients to utilize a technology-based approach to more efficiently manage their contingent staffing needs.


• | Interim Leadership Staffing and Executive Search Services. We acquired B.E. Smith (“BES”), The First String Healthcare (“TFS”) and MillicanSolutions (“Millican”), which we believe made us the nation’s largest provider of interim healthcare leadership staffing, including clinical leaders and executive leaders, healthcare executive search services and other related advisory services.


• | Workforce Optimization Services. Through our acquisition of Avantas, we offer workforce optimization services, including consulting, data analytics, predictive modeling and SaaS-based scheduling technology. We believe Avantas’ proprietary scheduling software helps create more cost effective staffing plans for our clients as compared to traditional methodologies.


• | Recruitment Process Outsourcing. In 2016, we continued to invest in our RPO service line, adding technologies and other capabilities to meet our clients’ growing needs for core staff recruitment expertise and services and to capitalize on the market opportunity.


• | Health Information Management. Through our acquisition of Peak Provider Solutions (“Peak”), we offer remote medical coding and related health information management auditing and consulting solutions to hospitals and physician medical groups nationwide.


• | Expanded Our Network of Qualified Healthcare Professionals. Through our Onward Healthcare acquisition, we increased our supply of healthcare professionals and recruiting capabilities in our traditional healthcare staffing areas of nurse, allied and locum tenens.


• | Per Diem Staffing. Our acquisition of Medfinders provided us an entry point into the local, or per diem, staffing market. We provide per diem staffing, often in conjunction with our larger MSP clients.

As a core component of our growth strategy and profitability, we also seek to strengthen and create efficiencies in our operational and technology capabilities. As a result, in 2015, we embarked on a multi-year investment in the modernization of our front office, back office and infrastructure domains. We have also increased our efforts to integrate technology-based solutions in our recruitment efforts through continued investment in our digital capabilities, mobile applications and data analytics. These efforts will provide a more seamless and efficient workflow for our team members, our clinicians, and our clients. Further, it will help us realize greater scale and cost efficiencies when fully implemented.
Moving forward, we believe our strategy will enable us to continue to grow the number of customers and segments of the market we serve, while enhancing our profitability and operating leverage. This means driving increased adoption of our existing workforce solutions and staffing services through cross selling and deepening our customer relationships as they grow and expand. We intend to continue to innovate and develop new, adjacent solutions to our portfolio by investing and partnering with best-in-class tools and services to optimize our clients’ workforce and engage our talent networks. We expect this will help us expand our strategic customer relationships to help them address their workforce pain points, while driving more recurring revenue, with an improved margin mix that, similar to our evolution to MSPs, will be less sensitive to economic cycles.
The successful implementation of our strategy relies in large part upon the superior execution of our key initiatives by our management, sales and operations teams. Accordingly, we offer a differentiated employment value proposition to attract and retain team members that focuses on fostering a growth-oriented, values-driven culture, talented leadership, and a collegial

work environment that challenges us to develop and meet our personal and professional goals. During 2016 and for the fourth consecutive year, we were awarded a spot on Achievers’ 50 Most Engaged Workplaces, which honors the top 50 employers in North America that are using leadership and innovation in engaging employees and making their workplaces more productive. Additionally, AMN was honored with several awards highlighting our operational strength, including the Exemplary Compensation Discussion and Analysis award by the NYSE Governance Services and an HRO Today Partnership in Staffing Excellence for MSP. We were also named to the 2016 list of “150 Great Places to Work in Healthcare” by Becker’s Hospital Review. 
Our Services

In 2016, we conducted our business through three reportable segments: (1) nurse and allied solutions, (2) locum tenens solutions and (3) other workforce solutions. We set forth each segment’s revenue and operating income under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.” Through our business segments, we provide our healthcare clients with a wide range of workforce solutions and staffing services as set forth below. 

(1) Travel Nurse Staffing. We provide clients with nurses, most of them registered nurses, to work temporary assignments under our flagship brand, American Mobile, as well as under our Onward Healthcare and Nurses Rx brands. Assignments in acute-care hospitals, including teaching institutions, trauma centers and community hospitals, comprise the majority of our assignments. The length of the assignment varies with a typical travel nurse assignment of 13 weeks. Under our O’Grady-Peyton brand, we also recruit nurses internationally from English speaking countries who immigrate to the United States under a permanent resident visa (Green Card) and who typically work for us for a period of 24 months.

(2) | Rapid Response Nurse Staffing and Labor Disruption Services. We provide a shorter-term staffing solution of typically up to eight weeks under our NurseChoice brand to address hospitals’ urgent need for registered nurses, including electronic medical records conversion projects. NurseChoice is targeted to recruit and staff nurses who can begin assignments within one to two weeks in acute-care facilities in contrast to the three to five week lead time that may be required for travel nurses. We also provide labor disruption services for clients involved in strikes of nurses and allied professional staff through our HealthSource Global Staffing subsidiary.


(3) | Local, or Per Diem, Staffing. Primarily through our Nursefinders brand, we provide our clients local staffing, often in conjunction with our larger MSP clients. Local staffing involves the placement of locally-based healthcare professionals on daily shift work on an as-needed basis. Hospitals and healthcare facilities often give only a few hours’ notice of their local staffing assignments that require a turnaround from their staffing agencies of generally less than 24 hours.


(4) | Locum Tenens Staffing. We place physicians of all specialties, advanced practice clinicians and dentists on an independent contractor basis on temporary assignments with all types of healthcare organizations throughout the United States, including hospitals, health systems, medical groups, occupational medical clinics, psychiatric facilities, government institutions and insurance companies. We recruit these professionals nationwide and typically place them on assignment lengths ranging from a few days up to one year. We market these services through our Staff Care and Locum Leaders brands.


(5) | Allied Staffing. We provide allied health professionals, both on a travel and local staffing basis, under the Med Travelers and Club Staffing brands to acute-care hospitals and other healthcare facilities such as skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation clinics, and retail and mail-order pharmacies. Allied health professionals include such disciplines as physical therapists, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, medical and radiology technologists, lab technicians, speech pathologists, rehabilitation assistants and pharmacists.


(6) | Physician Permanent Placement Services. We provide physician permanent placement services to hospitals, healthcare facilities and physician practice groups throughout the United States. Using a distinct consultative approach that we believe is particularly client-oriented, we perform the vast majority of these services on a retained basis through our Merritt Hawkins and MillicanSolutions brands. To a smaller degree, we also perform these services on a contingent basis through our Kendall & Davis brand. We also provide physician and executive leadership search services focused on serving academic medical centers and children’s hospitals nationwide through our MillicanSolutions brand. Our broad specialty offerings include over 70 specialist and sub-specialist opportunities such as internal medicine, family practice and surgery.


(7) | Interim Leadership Staffing and Executive Search Services. Through our recent acquisitions of BES and TFS, we provide executive and clinical leadership interim staffing, healthcare executive search services and advisory services. Practice areas include senior healthcare executives, physician executives, chief nursing officers and other clinical and operational leaders. This business line provides us greater access to the “C-suite” of our

3


clients and prospective clients, which we believe helps improve our visibility as a strategic partner to them and helps provide us with cross-selling opportunities.

(8) | Managed Services Programs. Many of our clients and prospective clients use a number of healthcare staffing agencies to fulfill their nurse, allied and locum tenens staffing needs. We offer a comprehensive managed services program, in which we manage all or a portion of a client’s contingent staffing needs. This service includes both the placement of our own healthcare professionals and the utilization of other staffing agencies to fulfill the client’s staffing needs. We believe an MSP reduces redundancies for our clients and allows them to optimize their staffing utilization. We often use our own VMS technology as part of our MSP, which we believe further enhances the value of our service offering. In 2016, we had approximately $1.0 billion in annualized gross billings under management under our MSP and approximately one-third of our consolidated revenue flowed through MSP relationships compared to approximately 1% in 2008.


(9) | Vendor Management Systems. Some clients and prospective clients wish to utilize a vendor-neutral VMS technology that allows them to self-manage the procurement of their contingent clinical labor. We provide two VMS technologies, ShiftWise and Medefis, to clients that desire this option. Our VMS technology provides, among other things, control over a wide variety of tasks via a single system and consolidated reporting. In 2016, we had approximately $1.2 billion in annualized gross billings flow through our VMS programs, for which we typically earn a 4% fee.


(10) | Recruitment Process Outsourcing. We offer our clients RPO services, customized to their particular needs, pursuant to which we recruit, hire and/or onboard permanent clinical and nonclinical positions on behalf of the client. Our RPO program leverages our expertise and support systems to replace or complement a client’s existing internal recruitment function for permanent staffing needs, providing flexibility to our clients to determine how to best garner the recruiting resources necessary to fill their permanent staffing needs.


(11) | Workforce Optimization Services. We provide workforce optimization services, including consulting, data analytics, predictive modeling and SaaS-based scheduling technology. Through the acquisition of Avantas, we acquired proprietary scheduling software, Smart Square, which utilizes predictive analytics to create better, more accurate and timely staffing plans for a client, which we believe effectively reduces the client’s aggregate clinical labor spend.


(12) | Health Information Management. Through our recent acquisition of Peak, we offer remote medical coding and related health information management consulting solutions to hospitals and physician medical groups nationwide.

Our Healthcare Professionals

The recruitment and retention of a sufficient number of qualified healthcare professionals to work temporary assignments on our behalf is critical to the success of our business. Healthcare professionals choose temporary assignments for a variety of reasons that include seeking flexible work opportunities, exploring diverse practice settings, building skills and experience by working at prestigious healthcare facilities, avoiding the demands and political environment of working as permanent staff, working through life and career transitions, and as a means of access into a permanent staff position.
We recruit our healthcare professionals, depending on the particular service line, under the following brands: American Mobile, Nursefinders, NurseChoice, NursesRx, HealthSource Global Staffing, Med Travelers, Club Staffing, Onward Healthcare, B.E. Smith, The First String Healthcare, O’Grady Peyton International, Staff Care and Locum Leaders. We believe that our multi-brand recruiting strategy, together with our innovative and effective marketing programs that focus on lead management, including our digital presence on websites, social media, and mobile applications, and our word-of-mouth referrals from the thousands of current and former healthcare professionals who we have placed enhances our effectiveness at reaching a larger number of healthcare professionals. While we are committed to this multi-brand strategy, we regularly assess our brands to drive brand clarity and maximize efficiencies. As a result of this evaluation, during 2016 we consolidated our Linde Healthcare brand into the Locum Leaders brand that we acquired in 2015.
When recruiting for healthcare professionals, in addition to other recruitment and staffing firms, we also compete with hospital systems that have developed their own recruitment departments and interim staffing pools. We believe that we attract and retain healthcare professionals because of our (1) large selection of assignment locations, settings and opportunities providing career development, (2) attractive compensation packages, (3) passionate, knowledgeable recruiters and service professionals who understand the needs of our healthcare professionals and provide a personalized approach and (4) excellent reputation. The attractive compensation package that we provide our healthcare professionals includes a competitive wage, professional development opportunities, professional liability insurance, 401(k) plan and health insurance. In addition, we may 
4


provide reimbursements for meals and incidentals, travel and housing, or we may provide company housing if a healthcare professional elects not to receive reimbursement.

Our Geographic Markets and Client Base

During each of the past three years, (1) we generated all of our revenue in the United States and (2) all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States. We typically generate revenue in all 50 states. During 2016, the largest percentages of our revenue were concentrated in California, Texas and New York. 
Over half of our temporary healthcare professional assignments occur at acute-care hospitals. In addition to acute-care hospitals, we provide services to sub-acute healthcare facilities, physician groups, rehabilitation centers, dialysis clinics, pharmacies, home health service providers and ambulatory surgery centers. Our clients, many of the largest and most prestigious and progressive health care systems in the country, include Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, New York Presbyterian Health System, MedStar Health, HCA, Stanford Hospital and Clinics, Johns Hopkins Health System, Providence Health, PeaceHealth and Partners Healthcare. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (and its affiliates), to whom we provide clinical managed services, comprised approximately 11% of our consolidated revenue and 18% of our nursing and allied solutions segment’s revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. No other client healthcare system comprised more than 5% of our consolidated revenue and no single client facility comprised more than 3% of our consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Our success in winning MSP contracts means some larger health systems have grown and may continue to grow more significantly relative to our other revenue sources. The dynamics could lead to a greater client concentration than we have historically experienced.
Our Industry

The primary market in which we compete is the U.S. temporary healthcare staffing market. Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) estimates that the segments of the target market in which we primarily operate have an aggregate 2017 estimated market size of $15.5 billion, of which travel nurse, per diem nurse, locum tenens and allied healthcare comprise $4.6 billion, $3.3 billion, $3.5 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. We also operate within the interim leadership, permanent placement, RPO, VMS, workforce optimization services, medical coding and consulting services markets.
Industry Demand Drivers

Many factors affect the demand for temporary and permanent healthcare staffing, which, accordingly, affects the size of the markets in which we primarily operate. Of these many factors, we believe the following serve as some of the most significant drivers of demand.

• | Economic Environment and Unemployment Rate. The demand for our services is affected by growth in the U.S. economy, which impacts the unemployment rate. Growth in real U.S. gross domestic product generally correlates to declining unemployment rates. When these macro-drivers are positive, it typically results in increased demand for our services and vice versa. Generally, we believe a positive economic environment and declining unemployment leads to an increasing demand for healthcare services and also reflects that healthcare facilities, like employers in many industries, experience higher levels of employee attrition and have a relatively more difficult time finding permanent staffing to fill their needs.


• | Supply of Healthcare Professionals. While there are differing reports of the existence and extent of current and future healthcare professional shortages, many regions of the United States are experiencing a shortage of physicians and nurses that we believe will persist in the future. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the physician shortage is expected to range from 61,700 to 94,700 physicians by 2025. In nursing, geographic and specialty-based shortages are also expected through 2025. The demand for our services is correlated with activity in the permanent labor market. When nurse vacancy rates increase, temporary nurse staffing order levels typically increase as well.


• | General Demand for Healthcare Services. Changes in demand for healthcare services, particularly at acute healthcare hospitals and inpatient facilities, affect the demand for our services. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 20 million people have gained insurance coverage between the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and early 2016. The increase contributed to a relatively sharp increase in national healthcare expenditures beginning in 2014 after remaining fairly flat for several years. Additionally, the U.S. population continues to age and medical technological advances are contributing to longer life expectancy. According to the United States Census Bureau, the number of adults age 65 or older, who are three times more likely to have a hospital stay and twice as likely to visit a physician office compared to the rest of the population, is on pace to grow an estimated 36% between 2015 and 2025. This may place upward pressure on demand for the services we provide in the coming years.

5



• | Adoption of Workforce Solutions. We believe healthcare organizations are increasingly seeking sophisticated, innovative and economically beneficial workforce solutions that improve patient outcomes. We believe the prevalence of workforce solutions, such as MSP, VMS, RPO and workforce optimization tools, in the healthcare industry is still underpenetrated in comparison with non-healthcare sectors. During 2016, approximately 35% of our consolidated revenues were generated through MSP relationships, which we believe is higher than the industry average. The changes in reimbursement methodologies, coupled with clinical labor representing a significant portion of a healthcare facility’s cost structure, may accelerate the adoption of strategic outsourced workforce solutions, which would likely place upward pressure on the demand for the services we provide.

Industry Competition
The healthcare temporary staffing and workforce solutions industry is highly competitive. We compete in national, regional and local markets for healthcare facility clients. Our comprehensive suite of workforce solutions, our commitment to quality and service excellence, our execution capabilities, our national footprint and our access to a wide network of quality healthcare professionals comprise our value proposition, which we believe resonates with clients and prospective clients. We believe that our size, geographic scope, broad spectrum of workforce solutions, talented and passionate team members and brand reputation give us distinct, scalable advantages over smaller, local and regional competitors and companies whose service offerings, sales and execution capabilities are not as robust. The breadth of our services allows us to provide even greater value through a more strategic, consultative and solution-oriented approach to our clients. Larger firms, such as us, also generally have a deeper, more comprehensive infrastructure with a more established operating model and processes that provide the long-term stability and foundation for quality standards recognition, such as the Joint Commission staffing agency certification and National Committee for Quality Assurance Credentials Verification Organization certification. With respect to our recruitment and placement businesses, our size and scale generally give us access to a larger pool of available candidates than our competitors and substantial word-of-mouth referral networks and recognizable brand names, enabling us to attract a consistent flow of new applicants.
We are the largest provider of nurse and allied healthcare staffing in the United States. In the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business, we compete with a few national competitors together with numerous smaller, more regional and local companies, particularly in the per diem business. We believe we are the third largest provider of locum tenens staffing services in the United States. The locum tenens staffing market consists of many small- to mid-sized companies with only a relatively small number of national competitors of which we are one. The physician permanent placement services market where we believe we hold a strong leading position is also highly fragmented and consists of many small- to mid-sized companies that do not have a national footprint. Our competitors vary by segment and include CHG Healthcare Services, Cross Country Healthcare, RightSourcing, Jackson Healthcare and Parallon Workforce Management Solutions.
Licensure For Our Business

Some states require state licensure for businesses that employ, assign and/or place healthcare professionals. We believe we are currently licensed in all states that require such licenses and take measures to ensure compliance with all state licensure requirements. In addition, the healthcare professionals who we employ or independently contract with are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state laws. We believe we take appropriate and reasonable steps to validate that our healthcare professionals possess all necessary licenses and certifications. We design our internal processes to ensure that the healthcare professionals that we directly place with clients have the appropriate experience, credentials and skills. Our travel nurse and allied healthcare staffing divisions, all of our locum tenens brands and all of our local staffing offices have received Joint Commission certification. We have also obtained our Credentials Verification Organization certification from the National Committee for Quality Assurance.
Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,990 corporate employees. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we had an average of (1) 8,764 nurses, allied and other clinical healthcare professionals, (2) 340 executive and clinical leadership interim staff, and (3) 444 medical coding professionals contracted to work for us. This does not include our locum tenens, all of whom are independent contractors and not our employees.
