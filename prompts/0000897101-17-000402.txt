Products for the Edge of the Network:
 
Suttle’s solutions for the last mile of the carrier’s network, i.e. the “Edge,” are designed to operate in challenging environments yet be easily accessible, extend the life of the existing network, enhance data speeds, and prevent loss of bandwidth at the point of use.
 
Suttle products are designed to work indoor and outdoor and feature flexibility and scalability in real world applications for both copper and fiber networks. Suttle’s FutureLinkTM solutions offer a range of products including terminals, patch-and-splice and splitter enclosures.
 
Products for the Connected Home/Business:
 
Suttle provides service distribution products for cost-effective solutions using existing and new structured wiring. These products reduce installation time and labor costs, and increase the provider’s return on investment. In addition to reducing a service provider’s up-front costs, Suttle’s high throughput solutions help eliminate potential bottlenecks to “future-proof” the installation, reducing future costs.
 
The MediaMAXTM brand provides for reliable brownfield and greenfield premise connectivity to meet the increasing demand for wired and wireless high-speed service throughout the home and business. Designed to optimize installation cost while maximizing coverage and bandwidth at the point of use for multiple deployment topologies, this brand includes a premise connectivity and distribution system, featuring plastic modular enclosures and tool-less, snap-in modules to minimize wireless interference. MediaMAXTM brand product replaces Suttle’s SOHOTM brand products, which have been Suttle’s primary premise distribution products for approximately the last 10 years.
 
 Another key feature of MediaMAX is installation cost and time saving tool-less technology available in jacks and modules. Rounding out the inside the premise/enterprise offering are faceplates and wall plates that accommodate hybrid/fiber, copper and coax connections for higher speed, tool-less connectivity and lower cost of ownership.
 
Markets and Marketing 
 
Suttle markets its outside plant and premise distribution products globally to telecommunications companies, service providers, residential builders, and low-voltage installers through distributors and the Company’ sales staff. Suttle has a solid history of offering long-term solutions to some of the largest global providers by understanding customers’ needs and providing innovative solutions coupled with strong customer support. Suttle reaches its targeted customers through a variety of marketing media including trade shows, associations, advertising, social media, and the Suttle website.
 
Suttle recently changed its domain name for electronic communications to SuttleSolutions.com to emphasize our focus on end-to-end customer oriented solutions for communication service providers.
 
Customers 
 
Suttle’s customers include telephone, CATV, internet service providers and enterprise networks. The Company’s major telephone company customers include AT&T, CenturyLink and Verizon. Suttle serves these major telephone companies directly by Suttle’s sales staff and through a select group of distributors. Sales (including DSL) to the major telephone companies, as a group, both directly and through distribution, represented 90% of Suttle’s sales in 2016 and 79% in 2015.

Competition
 
Suttle encounters strong competition in all its product lines and competes primarily on the basis of the broad lines of products offered, product performance, quality, price, delivery, and customer support. In addition, distributors of Suttle’s products also market products for one or more of its competitors.
Order Book 
 
Suttle manufactures its products both on a make-to-order basis and on the basis of customer forecasts. Outstanding customer orders at March 1, 2017 were approximately $3,604,000 compared to approximately $3,828,000 at March 1, 2016. New orders are generally filled within 60 days. Suttle does not believe its order book is a significant indicator of longer term future results.
 
Manufacturing and Sources of Supply 
 
Suttle manufactures its products using plastic or metal parts, wire sub-assemblies, fasteners, brackets, electronic circuit boards, and other components, most of which are fabricated by Suttle. There are multiple sources of supply for the materials and components and the Company is not dependent upon any single supplier, except that Suttle’s corrosion-resistant products use a moisture-resistant gel-filled fig available only from Tyco Electronics Connectivity. Although Suttle has not generally experienced significant problems in obtaining its required supplies, from time to time it experiences spot shortages and longer order lead times are required from its offshore suppliers.
 
New Product Development; Patents and Intellectual Property 
 
Suttle continually seeks to understand the needs of its customers and both develops new products for evolving customer requirements and enhances existing products to improve its existing product line. For competitive reasons, including duplication of its designs by foreign apparatus manufacturers, Suttle has adopted a policy to seek patent protection on innovative new products. Suttle applied for five patents in 2015, five patents in 2016 and expects to file two patent applications in 2017.
 
Research and development consists primarily of designing, prototyping, and testing of equipment and supplies associated with developing new products and enhancing existing products. Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and were $2,596,000 in 2016 compared to $4,959,000 in 2015.
 
Suttle and Suttle Solutions are important trademarks for its business. Suttle regularly supports these brand names by trade advertising and believes they are well known in the marketplace. Other important trademarks include FutureLinkTM brand for the last mile and MDU solutions; MediaMAXTM panels, modules, jacks and wall plates; SpeedStarTM for passive premise connectivity; and CorroShield® brand gel that prevents network corrosion.
