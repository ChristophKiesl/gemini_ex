Our Business
 Gaia, Inc., previously known as Gaiam, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on July 7, 1988 and operates a global digital video subscription service and on-line community that caters to a unique and underserved subscriber base. Our digital content library of over 7,700 titles is available to our subscribers on most Internet-connected devices anytime, anywhere commercial free.  Our subscribers have unlimited access to a vast library of inspiring films, cutting edge documentaries, interviews, yoga classes, transformation related content, and more – 90% of which is exclusively available to our subscribers for digital streaming.
 
Our mission is to create a transformational network that empowers a global conscious community. Content on our network is currently curated into three channels, Yoga, Transformation and Seeking Truth, and delivered directly to our subscribers through our streaming platform. We curate programming for these channels by producing content in our in-house production studios with a staff of media professionals. This produced and owned content currently represents about 80% of total views. We complement our produced and owned content through long term, predominately exclusive, licensing agreements. 
 Our Content Channels
 From the beginning, we have focused on establishing exclusive rights to unique content through in house productions, licensing and strategic content acquisitions.  Today, our network includes the following channels:
 Yoga – Through our Yoga channel, our subscribers enjoy unlimited access to streaming yoga, Eastern arts, and other movement-based classes. Currently, we are one of the world’s largest providers of streaming yoga classes.  Blending ancient philosophy with modern technology, our classes on Eastern arts like T’ai Chi, Qigong, Ayurveda and more encourage the holistic integration of body, mind and spirit.
 Transformation – Through our Transformation channel, we feature a wealth of content in the niche areas of alternative health, spiritual growth and expanded consciousness.  Our original and licensed content empowers subscribers to live stronger, healthier, more productive and enlightened lives.
 Seeking Truth – As an alternative to mainstream media, our Seeking Truth channel provides new and enlightening perspectives for today’s changing world.  Through thought-provoking questions like who are we and why are we here, and topics that include ancient wisdom and metaphysics, we go beyond the boundaries of mainstream media, and encourage our viewers to find empowerment through knowledge and awareness.  Through this channel, our subscribers have access to top names in the genre who conduct exclusive interviews and presentations not found anywhere else.
The Streaming Video Market and Gaia
 The consumption of streaming video is expanding rapidly with more and more people augmenting their use of, or replacing broadcast television with streaming video to watch their favorite content on services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, HBO Now and Gaia. The streaming video market includes various free, ad-supported and subscription service offerings focused on various genres, including films, broadcast and original series, fitness and educational content.
 Gaia’s position in the streaming video landscape is firmly supported by its wide variety of exclusive and unique content, which provides a complementary offering to other mostly entertainment-based streaming video services.  Our original content is developed and produced in-house in our production studios near Boulder, Colorado.  Over 90% of our content is available for streaming exclusively on Gaia to most Internet-connected devices.  By offering exclusive and unique content over a streaming service, we believe we will be able to significantly expand our target subscriber base. Gaia believes the current size of our potential target market represents approximately 7% of the global population with access to broadband.

Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competition and have been able to grow our business through the following demonstrated competitive strengths:
 Exclusive Content and Ubiquitous Access – We have amassed a library of unique content for which we hold exclusive worldwide streaming distribution rights and have established exclusive relationships with certain key talent in our areas of focus.  Over 90% of our titles are available to our subscribers for streaming on virtually any Internet-connected device exclusively on Gaia.
 Gaia Unplugged – We are able to leverage our content licensing and ownership advantage to enable “subscriber download” as part of our subscription.  A Gaia subscription allows subscribers to download and view titles in our library without being actively connected to the Internet as long as they remain a paying subscriber.
 Proprietary and Curated Content – Proprietary and curated content lies at the core of our business model.  Our media offerings introduce customers to us and help establish us as an authority in the conscious media market.  Our in-house produced and owned content represents approximately 80% of our subscribers’ viewing time.  Our licensed content has initial terms ranging from 3 to 20 years.  With the growth in demand for digital rights, we expect that our large library of produced and acquired content combined with our internal production capabilities will be a key driver in our ability to grow efficiently and act as a hedge against the rising costs of digital rights.
 International Rights – The strength of our proprietary content library created by our original content production strategy and our unique approach to content licensing have provided us with a library of niche content to which we hold exclusive worldwide distribution rights that we believe would be difficult to acquire in today’s market.  By obtaining these rights, we have created a significant barrier to entry for competitors in our content niches and have given ourselves the potential to reach a worldwide subscriber base with no additional licensing costs.  Based on viewership, approximately 90% or our library is available worldwide.
 Unique Subscriber Base – We believe that our unique and exclusive content allows us to cater to a subscriber base that traditional media companies have mostly ignored.  We believe this subscriber base can be significantly expanded as more and more people enter our niche categories and begin accessing streaming content over the Internet.
 Unique Content Strength – We believe that our unique focus, combined with our content exclusivity, positions us as a complementary service to larger streaming video providers who are primarily entertainment driven.  In addition, this focus has allowed an opportunity for significant advantages:

• | Yoga, we have an established consumer brand, a vast library of popular content, and knowledge and expertise on developing new content.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transformation, we bring a unique focus to an otherwise crowded field. This channel empowers subscribers through programs about alternative and integrative medicines, holistic healing, longevity, meditation, and other shows on conscious topics that puts Gaia in the center of a rapidly growing market. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seeking Truth, Gaia offers category-leading talent which enables us to draw the most popular and authentic speakers, authors and experts in the alternative media world.

Growth Drivers
 Our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business domestically and internationally using the following drivers:
 Investment in Streaming Content – We believe that our investment in streaming content leads to more awareness and viewership of our unique content.  This leads to subscriber acquisition and revenue growth, allowing us to invest more into our content library and enabling the growth cycle to continue.  By investing in our in-house studios, digital asset management system and digital delivery platforms, we can produce and distribute new digital content at low incremental costs.  With our end-to-end production capabilities

and unique, exclusive, relationships with thought leaders in our areas of focus, we believe we can develop content much more efficiently than our competitors.
 Continuous Service Improvements – We have found that incremental improvements in our service and quality enhance our subscriber satisfaction and retention.   In October 2016, we relaunched gaia.com with an entirely new technology stack at its core. The new site was built to optimize the speed and performance of streaming video playback, provide a unique and customized site experience for every subscriber and provide the foundation for our planned expansion into foreign languages. We continue to refine our technology, user interfaces, and delivery infrastructure to improve the customer experience.
 Overall Adoption and Growth of Internet TV on Every Screen – Domestically, cable TV subscribers have been declining, while the demand for digital content services accessible on various devices has continued to grow. Gaia is accessible on a broad array of devices, including, but not limited to: Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, Roku, Chromecast, Android devices including phones, tablets and Amazon Fire, laptops, desktop computers and TVs through an HDMI cord.  Through this accessibility, we believe that we enhance the value of our service to subscribers as well as position ourselves for continued growth as Internet and mobile delivery of content becomes more popular.
 International Market Expansion – We believe the international streaming segment represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for us as people around the world begin to adopt the viewing behaviors of the US market.  Our exclusive worldwide streaming rights allow us to expand internationally by adding foreign language support to our service without having to invest in local foreign operations.  Today, approximately 30% of our subscribers are outside of the United States.
 Complement our Existing Business with Selective Strategic Acquisitions – Our growth strategy is not solely dependent on acquisitions.  However, we will consider strategic acquisitions that complement our existing business, increase our content library, expand our geographical reach, and add to our subscriber base.  We will focus on companies with unique media content, a strong brand identity and subscribers that augment our existing subscriber base.
Marketing
 We are building awareness and demand for the Gaia brand through various channels focusing on mobile and video.  Organic search, paid search, digital and social media, email marketing, ambassador marketing, as well as various strategic partnerships make up our continually optimized portfolio of subscriber acquisition and retention tools.  Rejoining subscribers are an important source of subscriber additions, many of which come back to Gaia.com after receiving special communications via email.
 We maintain a website at www.gaia.com.  The website address has been included only as a textual reference.  Our website and the information contained on the website, or connected to the website, are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.  We have changed our principal marketing url to www.gaia.com from www.gaiamtv.com, and we will maintain www.gaiamtv.com as a redirect url.
 History
 We started as a conscious media and products company distributing conscious and non-theatrical media, with a maximum reach of approximately 70,000 retail doors in the United States. Over the past few years, we divested our solar energy business, our DVD distribution business, our Gaiam Branded consumer products business, and our eco-travel subsidiary for combined gains of over $150 million.
 We also expanded the number of conscious media titles with our acquisition of the entire content library of Wisdom Television.  Wisdom operated for 20 years as a cable and satellite channel.  Wisdom was the only TV channel that remained dedicated, year after year, to conscious media. With our acquisition of their digital media library we expanded our unique library of content directed at independent and progressive thinkers.

In 2012 we brought our streaming video service out of beta-test status, and focus our efforts on growing our streaming subscription services domestically and internationally by expanding our streaming content, enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming content to even more Internet-connected devices.
 In October 2013, we further expanded the digital yoga content available to our subscribers, and expanded our presence and subscriber base in the yoga community through our acquisition of My Yoga Online, the largest streaming yoga media service in Canada.
 In October 2016, we relaunched gaia.com with an entirely new technology stack at its core. The new site was built to optimize the speed and performance of streaming video playback, provide a unique and customized site experience for every subscriber and provide the foundation for our planned expansion into foreign languages.
 These investments in our subscription business have been instrumental in our ability to grow by expanding our streaming video on demand capabilities and increasing our library of unique content of transformational media, intended to awaken and inspire viewers around the world.
 Regulatory Matters
 A number of existing and proposed laws restrict disclosure of consumers’ personal information, which may make it more difficult for us to generate additional names for our direct marketing, and restrict our ability to send unsolicited electronic mail.  Although we believe we are generally in compliance with current laws and regulations and that these laws and regulations have not had a significant impact on our business to date, it is possible that existing or future regulatory requirements will impose a significant burden on us.
Competition
 While our content offering is unique, the market for subscription based content delivered over the Internet is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change.  Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another.  We are a focused provider within the streaming video market that is able to compete by providing exclusive content available on almost any device.  Our principal competitors vary by world geographic region and include multichannel video programming distributors and Internet-based movie and TV content providers, including those that provide legal and illegal (pirated) streaming video content.  We believe that due to the exclusivity of our content, we are positioning ourselves as a complementary service to large general content providers such as television broadcasters, cable television channels, and streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus and HBO Now.  Based on internal surveys of our subscribers, a majority of our U.S. subscribers also subscribe to Netflix.
Seasonality
 Our member growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy Internet-connected devices and, as a result, tend to increase their viewing, similar to those of traditional TV and cable networks.  Our member growth is generally greatest in the fourth and first quarter (October through March), and slowest in the May through August period.  As we expand internationally, we expect regional seasonality trends to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns.
Employees
 As of February 24, 2017, we had approximately 114 employees, all of which are full-time employees.  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success.  We use a combination of trademark, copyright and trade 
 4


secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property.  Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks, and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property.  We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.  We have changed our principal marketing url to www.gaia.com from www.gaiamtv.com, and we intend to maintain www.gaiamtv.com as a redirect url.
 Discontinued Operations
 During the second quarter of 2016, we sold our 51.4% equity interest in Natural Habitat, Inc. (“Natural Habitat”), our eco-travel subsidiary, in exchange for $12.85 million in cash, and recognized a gain of $10.3 million as disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 10, 2016.
 During the third quarter of 2016, we sold the assets and liabilities of our Gaiam Brand business in exchange for a gross purchase price of $167.0 million, and recognized a gain of $114.5 million before taxes. Our Gaiam Brand business previously constituted the majority of our consolidated revenues and expenses, and consisted of Gaiam branded yoga, fitness and wellness consumer products, and content (excluding the streaming rights).
 In the fourth quarter of 2013, we sold our non-Gaia-branded entertainment media distribution operations (“GVE”) and discontinued our direct response television marketing operations (“DRTV”). Discontinued operating results for 2014 and 2015 also include legal expenses associated with the sale of our DVD distribution business to Cinedigm.
 We report these businesses as discontinued operations, and, accordingly, we have reclassified their financial results for all periods presented to reflect them as such. Unless otherwise noted, discussions in this Form 10-K pertain to our continuing operations.
 Business Segments
 Through June 30, 2016, we managed our company and aggregated our operational and financial information in two reportable segments, which were aligned based on their products or services.

Gaia: | This segment represented our ongoing business, and the accompanying financial statements show the results of this business segment. This segment included our subscription video streaming service and the results of our legacy DVD subscription business. 
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Gaiam Brand: | This segment represents the operations that were sold during 2016 including our Gaiam branded yoga, fitness, and wellness products. It also included Natural Habitat until May 4, 2016. As discussed above, we completed the sale of the remaining Gaiam Brand business on July 1, 2016. The results of operations of the Gaiam Brand segment are shown as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Following the sale of the Gaiam Brand segment on July 1, 2016, our chief operating decision maker reviews operating results on a consolidated basis and we therefore have one reportable segment.
