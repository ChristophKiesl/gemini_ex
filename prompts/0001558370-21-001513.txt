ITEM 1.           BUSINESS
Overview
Advanced Energy provides highly-engineered, mission-critical, precision power conversion, measurement and control solutions to our global customers. We design, manufacture, sell and support precision power products that transform, refine, and modify the raw electrical power from the utility and convert it into various types of highly-controllable, usable power that is predictable, repeatable, and customizable. Our power solutions enable innovation in complex semiconductor and thin film plasma processes such as dry etch, strip, chemical and physical deposition, high and low voltage applications such as process control, data center computing, networking, telecommunication, analytical instrumentation, medical equipment, industrial technology and temperature-critical thermal applications such as material and chemical processing. We also supply related instrumentation products for advanced temperature measurement and control, electrostatic instrumentation products for test and measurement applications, and gas sensing and monitoring solutions for multiple industrial markets. Our network of global service support centers provides local repair and field service to our customers in key regions as well as upgrade and refurbishment services, and sales of used equipment to businesses that use our products. Our products are primarily sold into the Semiconductor Equipment, Industrial and Medical, Data Center Computing, and Telecom and Networking markets. Advanced Energy is organized on a global, functional basis and operates in a single segment structure for electrical power conversion and control products. We sell our products into four markets or applications and provide revenue data by market to enable tracking of market trends. Following the acquisition of Artesyn Embedded Technologies, Inc.’s embedded power business ("Artesyn") in September 2019, we have also provided information on an organic and inorganic basis, which in 2020 was limited to the Artesyn acquisition, to improve comparability during the periods. 
During 2020, we saw the continued spread of COVID-19 which grew into a global pandemic. Our first priority was to provide a healthy and safe working environment for our employees which led to intermittent shutdowns of our manufacturing facilities to implement new health and safety protocols and make additional investments to comply with government guidelines. There were periods when some of our manufacturing facilities were not operating or were operating at reduced capacity due to government mandates to restrict travel, require social distancing and implement health and safety procedures. Many of our engineers and non-manufacturing personnel transitioned largely to a work from home environment. Additionally, the availability of materials, parts and subcomponents needed for production was also impacted during 2020. We expect the challenges associated with this environment to continue into 2021.
Although COVID-19 has impacted our revenues and manufacturing efficiency over the course of 2020, COVID-19 has not materially impacted our liquidity, our ability to access capital, our ability to comply with our debt covenants or the fair value of our assets. Additionally, we believe the accommodations we have made to our work environment, including employees utilizing work-from-home arrangements where necessary, will not impact our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. While COVID-19 has not had a material adverse effect on our business during 2020, it is unknown if COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our future operations, our financial results (including, but not limited to, gross profit, and cash generation) or liquidity. Please see the information under the caption "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on the potential impacts of COVID-19 to the future operations of our business. 
​
We incorporated in Colorado in 1981 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1995. Our executive offices are located at 1595 Wynkoop Street, Suite 800, Denver, Colorado 80202, and our telephone number is (970) 407-6555.

See Item 1A "Risk Factors" for a discussion of certain risks related to our foreign operations.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing of our products is primarily performed in major sites in the PRC and the Philippines and in 2020 we began to increase production at an additional major manufacturing site in Penang, Malaysia. In addition, we perform limited specialty manufacturing for some of our products in the U.S., United Kingdom, Germany, and Denmark. Manufacturing in these locations, primarily in the PRC, exposes us to risks, such as exchange controls and currency restrictions, changes in local economic conditions, changes in laws and regulations, government actions, political conditions, and other regional risks including natural disasters and health risks, and an inability to meet customer demands if one of our facilities becomes impaired. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for a discussion of certain risks related to our manufacturing operations. 
Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components, to be manufactured to our specifications. We use numerous companies, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, some key parts may be obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. During 2020, COVID-19 impacted the availability of materials, parts, and subcomponents needed for production, and we expect the related supply chain challenges will continue into 2021. We seek to reduce costs and to lower the risks of production and service interruptions, as well as shortages of key parts by:

● | selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts using rigorous technical and commercial evaluation of suppliers’ products and business processes including testing their components’ performance, quality, and reliability on our power conversion product at our customers’ and their customers’ processes. The qualification process for our process power products, particularly as it pertains to semiconductor customers, follows semiconductor industry standard practices, such as "copy exact";
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | monitoring the financial condition and overall performance of key suppliers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts, including making last time purchases of key parts when notified by suppliers that they are ending the supply of those parts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | qualifying new parts on a timely basis and in geographies that reduce costs without degradation in quality;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | locating certain manufacturing operations in areas that are closer to suppliers and customers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | competitively sourcing parts through electronic bidding tools to ensure the lowest total cost is achieved for the parts needed in our products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
We seek patent protection for inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research and development. We currently hold 285 U.S. issued patents and 340 foreign issued patents, and we have 337 patent applications pending in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Most patents are active for 20 years, and our patents expire on various dates through 2039. A substantial majority of our patents are related to our process power products and solutions business. Generally, our efforts to obtain international patents have been concentrated in the industrialized countries within Europe and Asia because there are other manufacturers and developers of power conversion and control systems in those countries, as well as customers for those systems for which our intellectual property applies.
Litigation may, from time to time, be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. See "We are highly dependent on our intellectual property" in Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological development and changing customer requirements. We face a wide variety of competitors and no single company dominates any of our markets. Significant competitive factors in our markets include product performance, compatibility with adjacent products, price, quality, reliability, and level of customer service and support.
We encounter substantial competition from foreign and domestic companies for each of our product lines. Our list of competitors has increased over the past year due to the acquisition of Artesyn, which competes in different markets and against different competitors. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In some cases, competitors are smaller than we are, but are well established in specific product niches. Adtec Plasma Tech. Co., Ltd., COMET Holding AG., Daihen Corp., Kyosan Electric Mfg. Co., Ltd., MKS Instruments, Inc., New Power Plasma Co., Ltd. and TRUMPF Hüttinger GmbH + Co. KG. are primary competitors to our power conversion products for semiconductor and thin film processing. Competitors to our low voltage AC-DC and DC-DC embedded power conversion offerings include, but are not limited to ABB Ltd., Acbel Polytech Inc., Cosel Co., Ltd., Delta Electronics, Inc., Flex Ltd., Lite-On Technology Corp., Murata Manufacturing, MEAN WELL Enterprises, TDK-Lambda Americas Inc., and XP Power Ltd. In high voltage DC-DC, our competitors include, but are not limited to Crane Co., Matsusada Precision, Inc., and Spellman High Voltage Electronics Corp. CD Automation, Control Concepts Inc., Eurotherm and Spang Power Electronics offer products that compete with our power control modules. BASF SE., Fluke Corp., LayTec AG. and Photon Control Inc. offer products that compete with our thermal measurement and instrumentation products. Honeywell International, Inc., Morgan Schaffer Ltd., Qualitrol Corp., and Williamson Corp. offer products that compete with our gas detection and monitoring products. 
In addition, a focus on local content is causing new competitors to emerge around the world, with strong support from local governments, industry leaders, and investors. Our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on our ability to make timely introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, to localize these development and production activities in key world regions close to our customers, and to produce high quality products. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their products and introduce new products with competitive performance characteristics. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to these factors, although we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively in the future.

Research and Development
The market for our products is characterized by ongoing technological changes and evolving customer requirements. We believe that continued and timely development of new highly-differentiated products and enhancements to existing products to support end user and OEM requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve. Accordingly, we continue to devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our key customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their product requirements now and in the future.
Research and development expenses were $144.0 million in 2020, $101.5 million in 2019, and $76.0 million in 2018, representing 10.2% of our sales in 2020, 12.9% of our sales in 2019, and 10.6% of our sales in 2018.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 10,000 employees. Our employees are not represented by unions, except for statutory organization rights applicable to our employees in the PRC and Germany. We believe that our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We recognize that our employees are our most important asset, and we know that each person’s diverse background and unique skill set are fundamental to our success. See Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of human capital resources.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the environmental laws and regulations of the foreign federal and local jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing and service facilities. We believe we are in material compliance with all such laws and regulations.
Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.
