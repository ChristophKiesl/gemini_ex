Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for people with rare, debilitating, chronic diseases. We are currently focusing our efforts on products that treat diseases in the neuromuscular and neurological space, but we recently decided to expand our strategic focus to include acquiring or in-licensing innovative technology platforms and earlier stage programs in other rare disease therapeutic categories outside of these spaces. We are dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, and we believe in putting patients first in everything we do. 
 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in significant economic disruption, and has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our business. We are actively monitoring the situation and are taking those actions that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our patients, investigators, employees and stockholders. 
 In March 2020, in light of worsening conditions as a result of the pandemic, we implemented a number of safety related initiatives among our employees, including a travel ban and a work from home policy for all employees. This included our customer-facing employees, who began working remotely and utilizing telephone and web-based technologies to provide support to patients and their healthcare providers. We believe that because many healthcare providers have delayed seeing new patients because of the pandemic, there has been a delay in the diagnosis of new LEMS patients and their initiating therapy, which has slowed our efforts to locate new patients who could benefit from our therapy. However, we believe that as more healthcare providers resume seeing new patients on a regular basis, that this aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will lessen. 
 Our Firdapse® supply chain remains robust and thus far we have observed no disruptions in the production of Firdapse®. We reiterate that we are committed to providing patients with the ability to obtain an uninterrupted supply of Firdapse®, and we believe that we have an adequate supply of Firdapse® to address patients’ needs for the foreseeable future. Further, we are advised by our U.S. manufacturing partners that they have implemented contingency plans to remain in operation. We are committed to meeting our patients’ needs for Firdapse® and believe that our supply chain will continue to remain solid and uninterrupted through the COVID-19 outbreak and beyond. 
 Until such time as the COVID-19 pandemic is over, it will likely adversely impact the timetable of our ongoing and contemplated clinical trials and studies, and increase the costs of such trials and studies, consistent with the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on many biopharmaceutical companies. 
 Strategic Plan for 2021 and Beyond 
 Our Board of Directors recently approved an expansion in our company’s strategic focus to include acquiring or in-licensing innovative technology platforms and earlier stage programs in other therapeutic categories outside of neuromuscular diseases. To accomplish these new priorities, we are prepared to invest more heavily in research and development, including acquiring earlier stage opportunities and innovative technology. We believe that this strategic expansion will better position our company to build out a broader more diversified portfolio of drug candidates that we believe will add greater value to our company over the near and long-term. However, there can be no assurance that whatever product candidates or technology platforms we acquire, if any, will be successfully developed. 
 To spearhead this investment, we have commenced a national search for a key executive to manage this more progressive strategy. This person will likely be an M.D. or Ph.D. with at least 15-20 years of relevant pharmaceutical experience and experience in developing innovative drug technology. This person will be responsible for portfolio expansion planning and developing medicines from discovery through marketing authorizations, as well as strategic leadership across all R&D activities including, direct oversight of science and clinical research. 
 Firdapse®
In October 2012, we licensed the North American rights to Firdapse®, a proprietary form of amifampridine phosphate, or chemically known as 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate. When we acquired the rights to the product, it had already been granted orphan drug designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with LEMS, a rare and sometimes fatal autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness. Additionally, in August 2013, we were granted “breakthrough therapy designation” by the FDA for Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS. Further, the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation for Firdapse® for the treatment of Myasthenia Gravis (MG). 
 
4 

  On November 28, 2018, we received approval from the FDA for Firdapse® 10 mg tablets for the treatment of adult LEMS patients (ages 17 and above). In January 2019, we launched Firdapse® in the United States, selling through a field force experienced in neurologic, central nervous system or rare disease products consisting at the time of approximately 20 field personnel, including sales (Regional Account Managers), patient assistance and insurance navigation support (Patient Access Liaisons), and payor reimbursement (National Account Managers). We also have a field-based force of six medical science liaisons who are helping educate the medical communities and patients about LEMS and about our ongoing clinical trial activities evaluating Firdapse® for other ultra-orphan, neuromuscular diseases. Finally, we are working with several rare disease advocacy organizations (including Global Genes, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) to help increase awareness and level of support for patients living with LEMS, Anti-MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis, or MuSK-MG, and other neurological diseases, and to provide education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat. 
 In early 2020, we expanded our field sales group by almost one hundred percent and contracted with an experienced inside sales agency generating leads through telemarketing to targeted physicians. We made these changes to expand our sales efforts beyond the neuromuscular specialists who regularly treat LEMS patients to reach the roughly 9,000 neurology and neuromuscular healthcare providers that may be treating an adult LEMS patient who can benefit from Firdapse®. We also continue to make available at no-cost a LEMS voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody testing program for use by physicians who suspect that one of their patients may have LEMS and wish to reach a definitive diagnosis. Further, we are continuing to expand our digital and social media activities in order to introduce our product and services to potential patients and their healthcare providers. 
 We are supporting the distribution of Firdapse® through “Catalyst Pathways”™, our personalized treatment support program. “Catalyst Pathways”™ is a single source for personalized treatment support, education and guidance through the challenging dosing and titration regimen to an effective therapeutic dose. It also includes distributing the drug through a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies (primarily AnovoRx), which is consistent with the way that most pharmaceutical products for ultra-orphan diseases are distributed and dispensed to patients. We believe that by using specialty pharmacies in this way, the difficult task of navigating the health care system is far better for the patient needing treatment for their rare disease and the health care community in general. 
 In order to help adult LEMS patients afford their medication, we, like other pharmaceutical companies which are marketing drugs for ultra-orphan conditions, have developed an array of financial assistance programs that are available to reduce patient co-pays and deductibles to a nominal affordable amount. For eligible patients with commercial coverage, a co-pay assistance program designed to keep out-of-pocket costs to not more than $10.00 per month is available for all LEMS patients prescribed Firdapse®. We are also donating, and committing to continue to donate, money to qualified, independent charitable foundations dedicated to providing assistance to any U.S. LEMS patients in financial need. Subject to compliance with regulatory requirements, our goal is that no LEMS patient is ever denied access to their medication for financial reasons. 
 In May 2019, the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for Ruzurgi®, another version of amifampridine (3,4-DAP), for the treatment of pediatric LEMS patients (ages 6 to under 17). While the NDA for Ruzurgi® only covers pediatric patients, we believe that Ruzurgi® is regularly being prescribed off label to adult LEMS patients. We believe that under applicable law, Jacobus is not permitted to market its amifampridine product to adult LEMS patients in the United States, and we are continuing to aggressively take all steps available to us to protect Firdapse’s® exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to stop the off-label prescribing of Ruzurgi® to adult LEMS patients. If Jacobus is able to successfully sell Ruzurgi® off-label to additional adult LEMS patients, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We also believe that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated our statutory rights and was in multiple other respects arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law. As a result, in June 2019 we filed suit against the FDA and several related parties challenging this approval and related drug labeling. Our complaint, which was filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida, alleged that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated multiple provisions of FDA regulations regarding labeling, resulting in misbranding in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA); violated our statutory rights to Orphan Drug Exclusivity and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity under the FDCA; and was in multiple other respects arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Among other remedies, the suit sought an order setting aside the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi®. 
 On July 30, 2020, the Magistrate Judge considering our lawsuit against the FDA filed a Report and Recommendation in which she recommended to the District Judge handling the case that she grant the FDA’s and Jacobus’ motions for summary judgment and deny our motion for summary judgment. On September 29, 2020, the District Judge adopted the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, granted the FDA’s and Jacobus’ motions for summary judgment, and dismissed our case. 
 
5 

  We believe that the District Judge’s decision is incorrect as a matter of law and contrary to the plain language of the Orphan Drug Act. We believe that if the District Judge’s decision to grant summary judgment is correct on the law, it means that the FDA has the authority to effectively eliminate the benefits of exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act, which we believe will chill the incentive for drug companies to spend the millions of dollars necessary to develop an orphan drug. As a result, we have appealed the decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. There can be no assurance of the result of such proceeding. 
 We are currently developing a long-acting formulation of amifampridine phosphate. A number of candidate formulations have been prepared, and three of the most promising formulations were evaluated in a pharmacokinetic (PK) study completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. The results of this first PK study will be used to inform the design and refinement of future product formulations and additional PK work to be conducted in 2021. We have also completed a number of advisory board meetings with both patients and doctors in order to establish the optimum target characteristics of the long-acting formulation of amifampridine phosphate that are desired by the LEMS patient community and treating physicians. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop a long-acting formulation of amifampridine phosphate, that any such formulation will be approved by the FDA for marketing, or that any such formulation will be commercially viable. 
 On August 10, 2020, we announced the top-line results from our Phase 3 clinical trial (MSK-002) evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of adults with MuSK-MG. Our trial was a multi-site, international (United States, Italy and Serbia), double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the FDA. Unfortunately, the MSK-002 trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint or its secondary endpoint. However, we have recently concluded a detailed analysis of the data from this trial in an effort to understand why the MuSK-MG Phase 3 trial did not meet statistical significance on its endpoints, even though clinical improvement was observed by patients and investigators during the initial dose-titration period of the trial and in our previous proof-of-concept trial. We found in our analysis that there was a large degree of symptom variability during the double-blind withdrawal period. We believe that sources of such variability can be addressed in a redesigned study that may better demonstrate the efficacy of our drug for the treatment of MuSK-MG.
We plan to present our hypotheses and a revised protocol to the FDA with respect to the MuSK-MG indication for discussion during the first half of 2021. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will either grant a meeting, agree with our protocol design or, even if the study is successful, accept the results of a single study of a different trial design as sufficient evidence for approval of the MuSK-MG indication. While we prepare for the meeting with FDA, we also plan to evaluate new clinical trial sites and discuss the new trial design with investigators. After meeting with the FDA, we will determine whether or not to proceed with a new trial that incorporates the new trial design. 
 Our exploratory study, SMA-001 (A Randomized Placebo Controlled Crossover Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Amifampridine Phosphate in Ambulatory Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 3, met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant difference for the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). Clinically, however, the effect was modest. The secondary endpoints were not statistically significant, although several individual quality of life measures demonstrated a nominally positive statistically significant change. Key opinion leaders with whom we have spoken believed that Firdapse® needed to show a large clinically significant change if there was the possibility to affect disease progression through retrograde signaling from enhanced neuromuscular junction function. After considering all of these factors, we have concluded that the modest results exhibited in this study are unlikely to result in a sufficient modification of disease progression, and, particularly in light of the fact that there are now three approved disease modifying medications for SMA Type 3, we have decided not to pursue the SMA Type 3 indication further. 
 We intend to conduct a proof-of-concept study evaluating Firdapse® as a treatment for Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP). The scientific basis for considering this indication is that leakage of neuron potassium channels is observed in HNPP. Since Firdapse® is a potassium channel blocker, it may mitigate the pathological effects of the potassium channel leakage in HNPP patients. There can be no assurance that this proof-of-concept study will be successful. 
 There can be no assurance that clinical trials of Firdapse® that we undertake in the future will be successful. Further, there can be no assurance that we will ever be granted the right to commercialize Firdapse® for any additional indications. 
 Our NDS filing for Firdapse® for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS was approved by Health Canada on July 31, 2020. In August 2020, we entered into a license agreement with KYE Pharmaceuticals (KYE), pursuant to which we licensed the Canadian rights for Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS to KYE. Pursuant to the license agreement, KYE is obligated to pay us an up-front payment based on approval and product supply, data protection milestones based on achievements of sales and regulatory milestones, and a sharing of defined net sales upon commercialization.

  On August 10, 2020, Health Canada issued a Notice of Compliance (NOC) to Medunik for Ruzurgi® for the treatment of LEMS. We have since initiated a legal proceeding in Canada seeking judicial review of Health Canada’s decision to issue the NOC for Ruzurgi® as incorrect and unreasonable under Canadian law. Data protection, per Health Canada regulations, is supposed to prevent Health Canada from issuing a NOC to a drug that directly or indirectly references an innovative drug’s data, for eight years from the date of the innovative drug’s approval. The Ruzurgi® Product Monograph clearly references pivotal nonclinical carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity data for amifampridine phosphate developed by us. As such, we believe that our data was relied upon to establish the nonclinical safety profile of Ruzurgi® needed to meet the standards of the Canadian Food and Drugs Act. There can be no assurance of the results of this proceeding. 
 In May 2019, we entered into an amendment to our license agreement for Firdapse®. Under the amendment, we have expanded our commercial territory for Firdapse®, which originally was comprised of North America, to include Japan. Additionally, we have an option to further expand our territory under the license agreement to include most of Asia, as well as Central and South America, upon the achievement of certain milestones in Japan. Under the amendment, we will pay royalties on net sales in Japan of a similar percentage to the royalties that we are currently paying under our original license agreement for North America. 
 We have met with Japanese regulatory authorities and believe that we have reached an agreement with them as to the scope of the clinical trial that we will be required to undertake in Japan before we will be permitted to submit an application to the Japanese regulatory authorities to seek to commercialize Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS in Japan. We also have applied for orphan drug designation in Japan for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS. There can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain the right to commercialize Firdapse® in Japan or obtain orphan drug designation. 
 All of our patent rights for Firdapse® are derived from our license agreement. In August 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) allowed Patent No. 10,798,893 (the ’893 patent) to our licensor and thereby to us, and the patent issued on October 6, 2020. The patent is directed to the use of suitable doses of amifampridine to treat patients, regardless of the therapeutic indication, that are slow metabolizers of amifampridine. Any drug product containing amifampridine with a label that states the patented dosing regimens and doses in the Dosing and Administration section prior to April 7, 2034, the expiration date of the patent, could possibly infringe this patent. Generic drug product labels would necessarily have to do this, and we intend to take all appropriate actions to protect our intellectual property. 
 In that regard, in October 2020, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey against Jacobus and a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the specialty pharmacy marketing Ruzurgi®, PantherRx Rare LLC (PantherRx), for infringement of the ‘893 Patent. The suits have since been combined in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey. The lawsuit arises from Jacobus’ and PantherRx’s sales and marketing of Ruzurgi® (amifampridine, 10 mg). The lawsuit alleges that the Ruzurgi® product infringes the ‘893 patent when administered in accordance with its product labeling. The lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief to prevent further marketing of Ruzurgi® in violation of our patent rights. 
 We are also pursuing additional patent applications for Firdapse® in an effort to further protect our drug product. There can be no assurance that any additional patents will be issued which provide additional intellectual property protection for our drug product. 
 There can be no assurance that we do not or will not infringe on patents held by third parties or that third parties in the future will not claim that we have infringed on their patents. In the event that our products or technologies infringe or violate the patent or other proprietary rights of third parties, there is a possibility we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing or commercialization of our products that utilize such technologies until the underlying patent dispute is resolved. For example, there may be patents or patent applications held by others that contain claims that our products or operations might be determined to infringe or that may be broader than we believe them to be. Given the complexities and uncertainties of patent laws, there can be no assurance as to the impact that future patent claims against us may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. 
 Generic Sabril®
In December 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Endo International plc’s subsidiary, Endo Ventures Limited (“Endo”), for the further development and commercialization of generic Sabril® tablets through Endo’s United States Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, Par Pharmaceutical. Pursuant to the agreement, in December 2018, we received an up-front payment of $500,000. We will be entitled to receive a milestone payment of $2.0 million on the commercial launch of the product. Further, we will receive a sharing of defined net profits upon commercialization and we are obligated to share the costs of certain development expenses. 
 
7 

  There can be no assurance that our collaboration with Endo for the development of generic Sabril® (vigabatrin) tablets will be successful and that if an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) is approved for vigabatrin tablets in the future, that it will be profitable to us. 
 Capital Resources 
 At December 31, 2020, we had cash and investments of approximately $140.3 million. Based on our current financial condition and forecasts of available cash, we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our operations for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in commercializing Firdapse® or will continue to be profitable. Further, there can be no assurance that if we need additional funding in the future, whether such funding will be available to us. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further information on our liquidity and cash flow. 
Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize novel prescription drugs targeting rare (orphan) neuromuscular and neurological diseases and disorders. We are dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, and we believe in putting patients first in everything we do. Specifically, we intend to: 

• | Commercialize Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS and other potential neuromuscular diseases and improve disease awareness. We are currently commercializing Firdapse® in the United States and Canada. A cornerstone of our strategy is our continuing development of Catalyst Pathways™, our personalized treatment support program, and our development of the patient assistance programs that are required to further our goal that no LEMS patient be denied access to Firdapse® for financial reasons within existing legal restrictions. We also hope to develop Firdapse® for the treatment of other neuromuscular diseases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek to develop a long-acting formulation for Firdapse®. We are currently developing a Firdapse® long-acting formulation that we hope will provide meaningful patient benefits for patients with LEMS and other neuromuscular indications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek to acquire additional products. While we continue to focus on evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of other neuromuscular indications, we have expanded our strategic focus to include acquiring or in-licensing innovative technology platforms and earlier stage programs in other therapeutic categories outside of neuromuscular diseases. To accomplish these new priorities, we are prepared to invest more heavily in research and development, including acquiring earlier stage opportunities and innovative technology. We believe that this strategic expansion will better position us to build out a broader more diversified portfolio of drug candidates that we expect will add greater value to the company over the near and long-term. However, no products have been acquired to date.

Firdapse® Product Overview 
 Firdapse® is Catalyst’s registered trade name in the United States for amifampridine phosphate tablets. Amifampridine is the WHO (World Health Organization) registered INN (International Nonproprietary Name) and United States Adopted Name (USAN) for the chemical entity, 3,4-diaminopyridine, often abbreviated as 3,4-DAP or DAP. Firdapse® contains the phosphate salt of amifampridine, hence the name “amifampridine phosphate.” We will refer to our drug by its trade name in the United States (Firdapse®), by the INN/USAN (amifampridine), or by the specific salt in our product (amifampridine phosphate), throughout this Form 10-K.
Amifampridine has been recommended as the first-line symptomatic treatment for LEMS by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now known as the European Academy of Neurology). In December 2009, amifampridine phosphate received marketing approval from the European Commission (with the trade name Firdapse®) for the symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS. Safety data from clinical data published over the last 30 years in patients with LEMS or other neurological disorders treated with amifampridine show that amifampridine is well tolerated at doses up to 80 mg per day. Among the 1,279 patients or healthy subjects assessed in the literature, the most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were perioral and peripheral paresthesias (unusual sensations like pins and needles), and gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and epigastralgia (pain around the upper part of the stomach)). These events were typically mild or moderate in severity, and transient, seldom requiring dose reduction or withdrawal from treatment.

  Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) 
 Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, or LEMS, is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized primarily by muscle weakness of the limbs. The disease is caused by an autoimmune reaction where antibodies are formed against voltage-gated calcium channels on nerve endings, which damages the channels. These calcium channels are responsible for the transport of charged calcium atoms that activate the biochemical machinery responsible for releasing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter responsible for causing muscles to contract and the failure to release enough of this neurotransmitter results in muscle weakness in LEMS patients. Additionally, LEMS is often associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and in some individuals, LEMS is the first symptom of such malignancy. 
 LEMS generally affects the extremities, especially the legs. As LEMS most affects the parts of limbs closest to the trunk, difficulties with climbing stairs or rising from a sitting position are commonly reported. Physical exercise and high temperatures tend to worsen the symptoms. Other symptoms often seen include weakness of the muscles of the mouth, throat, and eyes. Individuals affected with LEMS also may have a disruption of the autonomic nervous system, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and/or hypotension. 
 LEMS is managed by treating the symptoms or treating the underlying autoimmune attack on voltage gated calcium channels. Unapproved treatments include steroids, azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulin, which work by suppressing the immune system; and pyridostigmine and amifampridine, which enhance neuromuscular transmission. Plasma exchange has also been used to attempt to remove antibodies from the body. Firdapse® is a symptomatic treatment and does not alter the underlying autoimmune condition. As a voltage gated potassium blocker, Firdapse® prevents charged potassium atoms from leaving the nerve cells, which prolongs the period of depolarization. This allows more charged calcium atoms to enter the nerves, which enables the nerves to release acetylcholine and causes muscles to contract and to restore lost muscle strength in LEMS patients. 
 Based on currently available information, we estimate that there are approximately 3,000 LEMS patients in the United States, approximately 1,500 of which are presently diagnosed and identified and approximately 1,500 of which we believe are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. However, until awareness of the disease is increased, it is unlikely that the total number of LEMS patients in the United States can be determined with better certainty (as is typical of rare diseases), and the actual number of patients in the United States with LEMS may be higher or lower than our estimate. 
 Some of the factors that affect the size of the population with a rare disease such as LEMS include the number of patients actually diagnosed with the disease, the number of patients who are misdiagnosed with other diseases, and the number of patients who are simply undiagnosed. Additionally, while there is an antibody test that positively identifies patients with LEMS, the test is not particularly well known or utilized at this time by many neurologists. Further, many LEMS patients who have small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are not being treated for LEMS because many oncology medical professionals who treat SCLC patients are generally unfamiliar with how to diagnose and treat LEMS. All of these factors affect the ultimate number of patients who will benefit from treatment with Firdapse®. 
 Firdapse® is the only FDA approved, evidence-based therapy for the treatment of LEMS in adults. 
 Anti-MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG)
Myasthenia Gravis, or MG, is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by fluctuating weakness of the voluntary muscle groups. The prevalence of MG in the United States is estimated to be about 20/100,000 population (equating to an estimate of approximately 64,000 patients in the United States). However, according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, MG is probably under diagnosed and the prevalence may be higher. For example, patients with MuSK-MG may have focal or regional weakness and muscle atrophy that are more suggestive of motor neuron or muscle membrane (myopathy) disease. MG occurs in all races, both genders, and at any age. MG is not thought to be directly inherited (although it occasionally occurs in more than one member of the same family), nor is it contagious. 
 The voluntary muscles of the entire body are controlled by nerve impulses that arise in the brain. These nerve impulses travel down the nerves to the place where the nerves meet the muscle fibers. Nerve fibers do not actually connect with muscle fibers. There is a space between the nerve ending and muscle fiber; this space is called the neuromuscular junction. When the nerve impulse originating in the brain arrives at the nerve ending, it releases a chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine travels across the space to the muscle fiber side of the neuromuscular junction where it attaches to many receptor sites. The muscle contracts when enough of the receptor sites have been activated by the acetylcholine. In MG, there can be as much as an 80% reduction in the number of these receptor sites. The reduction in the number of receptor sites is caused by an antibody that destroys or blocks the receptor site. Antibodies are proteins that play an important role in the immune system. They are normally directed at foreign proteins called antigens that attack the body. Such foreign proteins include bacteria and viruses. Antibodies help the body to protect itself from these foreign proteins. For reasons not well understood, the immune system of the person with MG makes antibodies against the receptor sites of the neuromuscular junction. Abnormal antibodies can be measured in the blood of many people with MG. The antibodies destroy the receptor sites more rapidly than the body can replace them. Muscle weakness occurs when acetylcholine cannot activate enough receptor sites at the neuromuscular junction. 
 
9 

  About 15% of MG patients test negative for the acetylcholine receptor antibody. These patients have seronegative (SN) MG. Approximately 40-50% of these patients with SNMG test positive for antibodies against muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), a surface membrane component essential in the development of the neuromuscular junction. These patients are identified as having MuSK-MG. Anti-MuSK antibodies identify a clinically distinguishable, more severe form of MG. The disease is characterized by a prominent weakness of the neck, oro-bulbar and sometimes respiratory musculature. Although many patients with MuSK-MG are presently treated with standard MG treatments such as anticholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants, such patients do not generally respond adequately to these treatments. 
 Based on currently available information, we estimate that there are between 3,000 and 4,800 MuSK-MG patients in the United States. There is currently no drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of MuSK-MG.
Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies 
 Hereditary Neuropathy with liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is a disorder that affects peripheral nerves. These nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells that detect touch, pain, and temperature. In people with this disorder, the peripheral nerves are unusually sensitive to pressure, such as the pressure that occurs when carrying heavy grocery bags, leaning on an elbow, or sitting without changing position, particularly with crossed legs. These activities would not normally cause sensation problems in people without the disorder. 
 Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or foot. An episode can last from several minutes to several months, but recovery is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the limbs, especially the hands. 
 A pressure palsy episode results from pressure on a single nerve, and any peripheral nerve can be affected. Although episodes often recur, they can affect different nerves. The most common problem sites involve nerves in the wrists, elbows, and knees. The fingers, shoulders, hands, feet, and scalp can also be affected. Many people with this disorder experience carpal tunnel syndrome, which occurs when a nerve in the wrist (the median nerve) is involved. Carpal tunnel syndrome is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers. An episode in the hand may affect fine motor activities such as writing, opening jars, and fastening buttons. An episode of nerve compression in the knee can lead to a condition called foot drop, which makes walking, climbing stairs, or driving difficult or impossible. 
 The symptoms of HNPP usually begin during adolescence or early adulthood but may develop anytime from childhood to late adulthood. Symptoms vary in severity; many people never realize they have the disorder, while some people experience prolonged disability. HNPP does not affect life expectancy. Based on currently available data, we estimate the prevalence of HNPP in the United States to be between 2,300 and 5,200 patients. 
 There is currently no standard medical treatment for HNPP. Management generally involves strategies to avoid or modify positions (such as leaning on the elbows) and activities that cause symptoms, and using splints or pads on the wrists or arms to avoid pressure on the nerves. An ankle-foot orthosis may be needed permanently for those with a residual foot drop. Management of pain may include over-the-counter pain medicines and/or prescription drugs used for peripheral neuropathy.

On October 26, 2012, we licensed the exclusive North American rights to Firdapse® pursuant to a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) between us and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (‘BioMarin”). Under the License Agreement, we make the following royalty payments on our net sales of Firdapse®: 

• | Royalties to the licensor for seven years from the first commercial sale of Firdapse® equal to 7% of net sales (as defined in the License Agreement) in North America for any calendar year for sales up to $100 million, and 10% of net sales in North America in any calendar year in excess of $100 million; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Royalties to the third-party licensor of the rights sublicensed to us for seven years from the first commercial sale of Firdapse® equal to 7% of net sales (as defined in the License Agreement between BioMarin and the third-party licensor) in any calendar year for the duration of any pending or issued patents or regulatory exclusivity within a territory and 3.5% for territories in any calendar year in territories without pending or issued patents or regulatory exclusivity.

  On May 29, 2019, we entered into an amendment to our License Agreement. Under the amendment, we expanded our commercial territory for Firdapse®, which originally was comprised of North America, to include Japan. Additionally, we have an option to further expand our territory under the License Agreement to include most of Asia, as well as Central and South America, upon the achievement of certain milestones in Japan. Under the amendment, we will pay royalties on net sales in Japan of a similar percentage to the royalties that we are currently paying under our original License Agreement for North America. 
 In January 2020, we were advised that BioMarin had sold certain rights under the License Agreement to SERB SA. 
 We believe that we remain in compliance with our obligations under the License Agreement. 
 Clinical trials supporting our NDA for Firdapse® for LEMS and approval of our NDA 
 We conducted two successful Phase 3 double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS. The results of the first trial published in 2016 in Muscle & Nerve (Muscle Nerve, 2016, 53(5):717-725). The results of the second trial were published in March 2019 in the Journal of Clinical Neuromuscular Disease (J. Clin Neuromusc Dis 2019; 20:111-119). 
 In March 2018, we submitted an NDA seeking approval of Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS. Our NDA was accepted for filing in May 2018 and, on November 28, 2018, the FDA granted approval of Firdapse® for the treatment of LEMS in adult patients. 
 Required Post-Approval Studies 
 As part of the approval of our NDA for Firdapse® for LEMS, the FDA is requiring us to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of amifampridine after oral administration of Firdapse® relative to that in subjects with normal hepatic function. We have submitted the final protocol and begun screening patients for this trial. We have also established a pregnancy surveillance program to collect and analyze information for a minimum of ten (10) years on pregnancy complications and birth outcomes related to Firdapse®. Finally, the FDA required us to perform a second carcinogenicity study of amifampridine phosphate in mice, which we expect to complete on a timely basis. 
 Expanded access program 
 We continue to operate an expanded access program (EAP) that is currently making Firdapse® available to certain patients diagnosed with CMS or Downbeat Nystagmus (DN). While we are no longer seeking an indication for Firdapse® for the treatment of CMS and have closed enrollment in the EAP to new CMS and DN patients, we are currently providing Firdapse® to those patients who were previously enrolled in our EAP. 
 Prior to the approval of our NDA for Firdapse® for LEMS, adult LEMS patients were also eligible to participate in our EAP program. We have since migrated the adult LEMS patients previously in our EAP to Catalyst Pathways™ and to commercial Firdapse®. 
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 Launch of Firdapse® in January 2019 
 In January 2019, we launched Firdapse® in the United States through a field force of approximately 20 personnel who are experienced in neurologic, central nervous system or rare diseases in sales, patient support and payer reimbursement. The sales representatives (Regional Account Managers) who were part of the field force targeted approximately 1,250 physicians who are either neuromuscular specialists or general neurologists with a known adult LEMS patient or specific training in neuromuscular diseases. We also utilized field force Patient Access Liaisons who work with the patients and provider offices to help navigate the insurance landscape, as well as National Account Managers who work directly with the payors to ensure comprehensive coverage for Firdapse® across the commercial and governmental plans in the United States. We also have a field-based force of six medical science liaisons who help educate the medical communities and patients about LEMS and about our company’s ongoing clinical trial activities. Further, we work closely with several rare disease advocacy organizations (including Global Genes, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) to help increase awareness and the level of support for patients living with LEMS, MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis, and other neuromuscular diseases that may be treatable with Firdapse®, and to provide education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat. 
 In early 2020, we expanded our field sales group by almost one hundred percent and established a partnership with an experienced inside sales agency generating leads through telemarketing to targeted physicians. Through this expansion of our sales team, we are working to expand our sales efforts beyond the neuromuscular specialists who regularly treat LEMS patients to reach roughly 9,000 neurology and neuromuscular healthcare providers that might be treating an adult LEMS patient who can benefit from Firdapse®. We also make available a no-cost LEMS voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody testing program for physicians who suspect their patient may have LEMS and wish to reach a definitive diagnosis. 
 
11 

  We are supporting the distribution of Firdapse® through “Catalyst Pathways”™, our personalized treatment support program. “Catalyst Pathways”™ is a single source for personalized treatment support, education and guidance through the challenging dosing and titration regimen to an effective therapeutic dose. It also includes distributing the drug through a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies (primarily AnovoRx), which is consistent with the way that most pharmaceutical products for ultra-orphan diseases are distributed and dispensed to patients. By using specialty pharmacies in this way, the difficult task of navigating the health care system is far better for the patient needing treatment for their rare disease and the health care community in general. 
 In addition, “Catalyst Pathways”™ is the gateway for our free bridge medication for patients during transitioning from investigational product while they are waiting for a coverage determination or, later on, for patients whose access is threatened by the bureaucratic complications arising from a change of insurer. The “Catalyst Pathways”™ program is also the access point for our Patient Assistance Program, which provides longer-term free medication for those who are uninsured or functionally uninsured with respect to Firdapse® because they may be unable to obtain coverage from their payer despite having health insurance. 
 We are continuing efforts on the longer, slower process to identify patients and their physicians who have diagnosed LEMS, but have not had access, awareness or understanding of this treatment for their rare disease. These patients often do not see their physician frequently, have many questions about changing treatment(s), and may not perceive the need to change to a new therapy.    Further, we have begun to focus our commercial efforts to locate misdiagnosed and undiagnosed LEMS patients and provide educational and sales activities to help improve the diagnosis, understanding of the treatment, and information on the prescribing process. We plan to continue to support LEMS and rare disease patient organizational groups’ efforts to generate awareness and educate patients and physicians on the diagnosis of LEMS, the impact of the disease, and the support services and treatments available. 
 Access to Firdapse®
In order to help patients afford their medication, we, like other pharmaceutical companies who are marketing drugs for ultra-orphan conditions, have developed an array of financial assistance programs that are available to reduce patient co-pays and deductibles to a nominal affordable amount. For eligible patients with commercial coverage, a co-pay assistance program designed to keep out-of-pocket costs to $10 or less per month is available for all LEMS patients prescribed Firdapse®. We are also donating, and committing to continue to donate, money to qualified, independent charitable foundations dedicated to providing assistance to LEMS patients in financial need. Our goal is to ensure that no LEMS patient is ever denied access to their medication for financial reasons. 
 To date, Firdapse has been widely covered and reimbursed by private and public payors for the indicated small population of adult LEMS patients. 
 FDA approval of Ruzurgi® for pediatric LEMS patients (ages 6 to under 17) 
 In May 2019, the FDA approved an NDA for Ruzurgi®, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals’ version of amifampridine (3,4-DAP), for the treatment of pediatric LEMS patients (ages 6 to under 17). We believe that the vast majority of Ruzurgi® sales are to adult LEMS patients who are being prescribed the drug off label. If Jacobus is able to successfully sell Ruzurgi® off-label to additional adult LEMS patients, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We believe that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated our statutory rights and was in multiple other respects arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law. As a result, in June 2019 we filed suit against the FDA and several related parties challenging this approval and related drug labeling. Jacobus later intervened in the case. Our complaint, which was filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida, alleged that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated multiple provisions of FDA regulations regarding labeling, resulting in misbranding in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA); violated our statutory rights to Orphan Drug Exclusivity and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity under the FDCA; and was in multiple other respects arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Among other remedies, the suit seeks an order vacating the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi®. 
 On July 30, 2020, the Magistrate Judge considering this lawsuit filed a Report and Recommendation in which she recommended to the District Judge handling the case that she grant the FDA’s and Jacobus’ motions for summary judgment and deny our motion for summary judgment. On September 29, 2020, the District Judge adopted the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, granted the FDA’s and Jacobus’ motions for summary judgment, and dismissed our case. 
 We believe that the District Judge’s decision is incorrect as a matter of law and contrary to the plain language of the Orphan Drug Act. We believe that if the District Judge’s decision to grant summary judgment is correct on the law, it means that the FDA has the authority to effectively eliminate the benefits of exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act, which we believe will chill the incentive for drug companies to spend the millions of dollars necessary to develop an orphan drug. As a result, we have appealed the decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. There can be no assurance of the result of such proceeding.

  Third-Party Reimbursement 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private commercial insurance plans and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) plans. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and the amount of reimbursement to be provided for Firdapse® are expected to be made on a plan-by-plan, and in some cases, on a patient-by-patient basis. Particularly given the rarity of LEMS, our experience has been that securing coverage and appropriate reimbursement from third-party payors requires targeted education and highly skilled insurance navigation experts that have experience with rare disease launches and medical exception processes at insurance companies to provide patient coverage for important rare disease therapies. To that end, we have engaged a dedicated team of field-based market access account managers and reimbursement experts as well as a patient service center staffed with experienced personnel focused on ensuring that clinically-qualified patients have access to our product. 
 There can be no assurance, however, as to whether payors will continue to cover our product, and if so, at what level of reimbursement. Further, there can be no assurance as to whether payors will in the future require that patients try Ruzurgi® before they are treated with Firdapse®. In that regard, we have advised payors that we will provide free medication to support titration and confirm patient therapeutic benefit. Further, when necessary, we provide patients with access to therapy at no charge while those patients are awaiting coverage decisions. 
 Our efforts to develop Firdapse® as a treatment for additional neuromuscular indications 
 The current status of our clinical trials evaluating Firdapse® for additional indications is as follows: 
 MuSK-MG studies 
 In February 2016, we initiated an investigator-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of Firdapse® as a symptomatic treatment for patients with MuSK-MG. Seven patients participated in this proof-of-concept trial. On March 15, 2017, we reported top-line results from this trial. Both of the co-primary efficacy endpoints of change from baseline (CFB) in total Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score (p=0.0003) and CFB in total Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score (p=0.0006) were statistically and clinically significant in this trial. Several secondary efficacy measures also achieved statistical significance. Amifampridine phosphate was well tolerated in this population of patients. 
 The results of this study were published in SAGE Open Medicine and can be accessed at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2050312118819013. 
 Subsequently, we engaged in a Phase 3 clinical trial (MSK-002) evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of adults with MuSK-MG. Our trial was a multi-site, international (United States, Italy and Serbia), double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the FDA. The trial enrolled more than 60 MuSK antibody positive patients. It also enrolled more than 10 generalized myasthenia gravis patients who were assessed with the same clinical endpoints. However, achieving statistical significance in this subgroup of patients was not required. 
 On August 10, 2020, we announced the top-line results from our Phase 3 clinical trial (MSK-002) evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of adults with MuSK-MG. Unfortunately, the MSK-002 trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint or its secondary endpoint, even though clinical improvement was observed by patients and investigators during the initial dose-titration period of the trial and in the company’s previous proof-of-concept trial. However, we have recently concluded a detailed analysis of the data from this trial in an effort to understand why the MuSK-MG Phase 3 trial did not meet statistical significance on its endpoints. We found in our analysis that there was a large degree of symptom variability during the double-blind withdrawal period. We believe that sources of such variability can be addressed in a redesigned study that may better demonstrate the efficacy of our drug for the treatment of MuSK-MG.
With respect to the MuSK-MG indication, we plan to present our hypotheses and a revised protocol to the FDA for discussion during the first half of 2021. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will either grant a meeting, agree with our protocol design or, even if the study is successful, accept the results of a single study of a different trial design as sufficient evidence for approval of the MuSK-MG indication. While we prepare for the meeting with FDA, we also plan to evaluate new clinical trial sites and discuss the new trial design with investigators. After meeting with the FDA, we will determine whether or not to proceed with a new trial that incorporates the new trial design.

  Proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating Firdapse® for the treatment of SMA Type 3 
 Our exploratory study, SMA-001 (A Randomized Placebo Controlled Crossover Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Amifampridine Phosphate in Ambulatory Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 3, met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant difference for the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). Clinically, however, the effect was modest. The secondary endpoints were not statistically significant, although several individual quality of life measures demonstrated a positive nominally statistically significant change. Key opinion leaders with whom we have spoken believed that Firdapse® needed to show a large clinically significant change if there was the possibility to affect disease progression through retrograde signaling from enhanced neuromuscular junction function. After considering all of these factors, we have concluded that the modest results exhibited in this study are unlikely to result in a sufficient modification of disease progression, and, particularly in light of the fact that there are now three approved disease modifying medications for SMA Type 3, we have decided not to pursue the SMA Type 3 indication further. 
 HNPP proof-of-concept study 
 We intend to conduct a proof-of-concept study evaluating Firdapse® as a treatment for Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP). The scientific basis for considering this indication is that leakage of neuron potassium channels is observed in HNPP. Firdapse is a potassium channel blocker and may mitigate the pathological effects of the potassium channel leakage in HNPP patients. 
 HNPP is an autosomal-dominantly inherited peripheral nerve disease caused by a heterozygous deletion of PMP22 gene, leading to a reduction of PMP22 proteins by 35-50% of normal level, which results in disruption of the myelin sheaths of motor neuron axons. Patients with HNPP often present with focal sensory and motor deficits. The events may be triggered by mild mechanical compressions innocuous to healthy humans. In addition, HNPP patients are also afflicted by fatigue. We believe that HNPP affects about 6,000 patients in the Unites States. There can be no assurance of the results of this trial. 
 Kennedy’s disease 
 We had previously reported that we planned to evaluate Firdapse® as a treatment of Kennedy’s disease (spinal bulbar muscular atrophy). Previously, key opinion leaders had suggested to us that Firdapse® might be an effective treatment for the symptoms of Kennedy’s disease. However, given the results of the SMA Type 3 proof-of-concept study and the lack of a targeted mechanism of action for Firdapse® in Kennedy’s disease, we have determined not to pursue this indication further. 
 Long-acting version of amifampridine phosphate 
 We have been developing a long-acting formulation of amifampridine phosphate, and our development remains on track. A large number of candidate formulations were prepared, and three of the most promising formulations were evaluated in a pharmacokinetic (PK) study completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. The results from this first PK study will be used to inform the design and refinement of future product formulations in 2021, and additional PK work is also expected to be conducted during 2021. Catalyst has also completed a number of advisory board meetings with both patients and doctors in order to establish the optimum target characteristics of a long-acting formulation of amifampridine phosphate that are desired by the LEMS patient community and treating physicians. 
   There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop a long-acting formulation of amifampridine phosphate, that any such formulation will be approved by the FDA for marketing, or that any such formulation will be commercially viable.

Intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity protections for Firdapse®
All of our patent rights for Firdapse® are derived from our license agreement. In August 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) allowed a patent (the ’893 patent) to our licensor and thereby to us, and the patent issued on October 6, 2020. The patent is directed to the use of suitable doses of amifampridine to treat patients, regardless of the therapeutic indication, that are slow metabolizers of amifampridine. Any drug product containing amifampridine with a label that states the patented dosing regimens and doses in the Dosing and Administration section prior to April 7, 2034, the expiration date of the patent, could possibly infringe this patent. Generic drug product labels would necessarily have to do this, and we intend to take all appropriate actions to protect our intellectual property. 
 In that regard, in October 2020, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey against Jacobus and a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the specialty pharmacy marketing Ruzurgi®, PantherRx Rare LLC (PantherRx), for infringement of the ‘893 Patent. The suits have since been combined in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey. The lawsuit arises from Jacobus’ and PantherRx’s sales and marketing of Ruzurgi® (amifampridine, 10 mg). The lawsuit alleges that the Ruzurgi® product infringes the ‘893 patent when administered in accordance with its product labeling. The lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief to prevent further marketing of Ruzurgi® in violation of our patent rights. 
 
14 

  We are also pursuing additional patent applications for Firdapse® in an effort to further protect our drug product. There can be no assurance that any additional patents will be issued which provide additional intellectual property protection for our drug product. 
 Further, there can be no assurance that we do not or will not infringe on patents held by third parties or that third parties in the future will not claim that we have infringed on their patents. In the event that our products or technologies infringe or violate the patent or other proprietary rights of third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing or commercialization of our products that utilize such technologies. For example, there may be patents or patent applications held by others that contain claims that our products or operations might be determined to infringe or that may be broader than we believe them to be. Given the complexities and uncertainties of patent laws, there can be no assurance as to the impact that future patent claims against us may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. 
 Until Firdapse® was approved in November 2018, no drug product containing amifampridine for any indication had been approved by the FDA such that we received five-year “new chemical entity” exclusivity from the FDA. New chemical entity exclusivity provides a five-year period of marketing exclusivity for all indications and in the absence of an Orange Book listed patent, precludes a generic from submitting an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) until that five year period has expired. Further, when Firdapse® was approved for the treatment of LEMS patients, we received seven-year orphan drug exclusivity for our product for the treatment of LEMS. 
 In light of the FDA’s decision to approve Ruzurgi®, the scope and protections afforded by the exclusivities that we received upon the approval of our product remain unclear, and our suit against the FDA seeking to undo the approval of Ruzurgi® is our attempt to undo what we believe was a violation of our statutory right to exclude others from the market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in those efforts. 
 We have licensed the Firdapse® trademark, and the trademark was registered in the United States in March 2015. 
 Protection of our intellectual property and regulatory exclusivities is a strategic priority for our business. Our ability to protect and use our intellectual property rights and regulatory exclusivity in the future development and commercialization of our products, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights, is crucial to our future success. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Generic Sabril®
In September 2015, we announced the launch of a program to develop our version of vigabatrin (CPP-109) as a generic version of Sabril®, which is marketed in the United States by Lundbeck. Lundbeck’s exclusivity for Sabril® expired on April 26, 2018. Vigabatrin comes in two dosage forms – a powder sachet and a tablet. Par Pharmaceutical brought the first generic version of the powder sachet to market, and since then several additional generic versions of this product have been approved. However, there is only one approved generic version of the tablets at this time. 
 On December 18, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Endo International plc’s subsidiary, Endo Ventures Limited (“Endo”), for the further development and commercialization of generic Sabril® tablets through Endo’s United States Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, Par Pharmaceutical. Pursuant to the agreement, in December 2018, we received an up-front payment of $500,000. We will be entitled to receive a milestone payment of $2.0 million on the commercial launch of the product. Further, we will receive a sharing of defined net profits upon commercialization and certain expenses for development. 
 There can be no assurance that our collaboration with Endo for the development of generic Sabril® (vigabatrin) tablets will be successful and that if an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) is approved for vigabatrin tablets in the future, that it will be profitable to us. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 We are licensed in Florida as a virtual drug manufacturer, which means that we have no in-house manufacturing capacity and we are obligated to rely on contract manufacturers and packagers. We have no plans to build or acquire the manufacturing capability needed to manufacture any of our research materials or commercial products, and we expect that our drug products and drug substances will be prepared by contractors with suitable capabilities for these tasks and that we will enter into appropriate supply agreements with these contractors at appropriate times in the development and commercialization of our products. Because we will use contractors to manufacture and supply our products, we will be reliant on such contractors. Further, the contractors selected would have to be inspected by the FDA and found to be in substantial compliance with federal regulations in order for a drug application for one of our drug candidates to be approved, and there can be no assurance that the contractors we select would pass such an inspection. 
 
15 

  We have entered into agreements with a supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) contained in Firdapse® for future requirements and we have contracted with third-party contract manufacturers who are manufacturing Firdapse® tablets for us. 
 Any significant change that we make for Firdapse® must be approved by the FDA in a supplemental new drug application (sNDA). If the manufacturing plan and data are insufficient, any sNDA we submit will not be approved. Before an sNDA can be approved, our manufacturers must also demonstrate compliance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) regulations and policies. Further, even if we receive approval of any sNDAs for Firdapse®, if our manufacturers do not follow cGMPs in the manufacture of our products, it may delay product launches or shipments and adversely affect our business. 
 Since we contract with third parties to manufacture our products, our contract manufacturers are required to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect the manufacturing process. As a result, we do not believe that we will have any significant direct exposure to environmental issues. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed or licensed by us would likely compete with currently marketed and potentially new drugs and therapies even though they are not indicated for these conditions. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of orphan diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources than we have. 
 Before the approval of Firdapse®, LEMS was generally treated with unapproved drugs and therapies including steroids, azathioprine, other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin, which work by suppressing the immune system, and pyridostigmine. Plasma exchange has also been used in an attempt to remove antibodies from the body. Further, one other product, guanidine HCl tablets, was approved many years ago (during a period when drugs were not required to be reviewed by the FDA for both safety and effectiveness) for use in the treatment of LEMS. However, this drug has significant side effects and is not currently viewed as an effective treatment for LEMS. Notwithstanding, drugs may be prescribed by physicians for the treatment of LEMS whether or not they are considered effective. 
 In May 2019, we became aware that the FDA had approved an NDA for Jacobus Pharmaceuticals for Ruzurgi®, their version of amifampridine (3,4-DAP) for the treatment of pediatric LEMS patients (ages 6 to under 17). While we have filed suit against the FDA to vacate their approval of Ruzurgi®, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this lawsuit or as to the impact of the approval of Ruzurgi® on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Finally, we are aware that amifampridine has been available from compounding pharmacies for many years and may remain available, even though we have obtained FDA approval of Firdapse®. Compounded amifampridine is likely to be substantially less expensive than Firdapse®. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 included a new section, which clarified the status of pharmacy compounding under Federal law. Under Section 503A, drug products that are lawfully compounded by a pharmacist or physician for an individual patient may be entitled to exemptions from three key provisions of the FDCA: (1) the adulteration provision of section 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning FDA’s cGMP regulations); (2) the misbranding provision of section 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and (3) the new drug provision of section 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug or abbreviated new drug applications). 
 To qualify for these statutory exemptions, a compounded drug product must satisfy several legal requirements. One of these requirements restricts the universe of bulk drug substances that a compounder may use. Specifically, every bulk drug substance used in compounding: (1) must comply with an applicable and current USP or NF drug monograph, if one exists, as well as the current USP chapters on pharmacy compounding; (2) if such a monograph does not exist, the bulk drug substance must be a component of an FDA-approved drug; or (3) if a monograph does not exist and the bulk drug substance is not a component of an FDA-approved drug, it must appear on a list of bulk drug substances that may be used in compounding (i.e., the “Section 503A bulk substances list 1”). While the advertising provisions in Section 503A were ruled unconstitutional in part in the United States by the Supreme Court in 2002, the FDA, since 2013, has aggressively regulated and exercised oversight over the practice of pharmacy compounding following the compounding incident at the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts that sickened hundreds and killed over 60 individuals. 
 In 2013, Congress removed the unconstitutional advertising provisions in Section 503A when it passed the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA), Title I (The Compounding Quality Act). The DQSA also created “outsourcing facilities” under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which are drug compounders that voluntarily register with FDA and may produce compounded formulations for office use (at least one of which must be sterile), but must comply with FDA’s cGMP regulations and other requirements set forth in Section 503B. Section 503B outsourcing facilities may also only compound from bulk substances if the product is on FDA’s drug shortage list, or the substance is on FDA’s Section 503B list of bulk substances that may be used in compounding (i.e., the Section 503B bulk substances list 1”). 
 
16 

  While the FDA has been aggressively enforcing Section 503A since its re-enactment, compounders may still compound “near copies” (but not “essentially copies”) of approved drug products, under Section 503A, so long as the prescriber makes a change to the compounded formulation that produces for that patient a significant difference between the commercially available drug and the compounded version. Compounders may also copy commercially available products if they do not do so in “regular or inordinate amounts.” In January 2018, FDA published a Final Guidance document titled, “Compounded Drug Products That Are Essentially Copies of a Commercially Available Drug Product Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.” This Final Guidance sets forth FDA’s enforcement policy concerning those compounders that make essentially copies of commercially available drug products. FDA has defined the term “regular or inordinate” in the Final Guidance to mean: “a drug product that is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug product is compounded regularly or in inordinate amounts if it is compounded more frequently than needed to address unanticipated, emergency circumstances, or in more than the small quantities needed to address unanticipated, emergency circumstances.” FDA has further stated it will not take enforcement action, considering all the facts and circumstances, against a compounder that compounds less than four “essentially copies” of a commercially available drug product in a calendar month. 
 Generic Sabril®
Sabril® is marketed by Lundbeck in the United States for infantile spasms and for refractory complex partial seizures. Lundbeck’s sales of Sabril® (tablets and sachets) were approximately $195 million in 2018 and $123 million in 2019. One generic version of Sabril® tablets has been approved to date in the United States, as have numerous generic version of the powder form. We have entered into a definitive agreement with Endo/Par for the further development and commercialization of generic Sabril® tablets.

Regulatory Matters 
 Government regulation and product approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, record-keeping, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our drugs must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state statutes. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



17 

  
• | submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before the trials are initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to, and acceptance by, the FDA of an NDA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------


The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. 
 United States drug development process 
 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. Prior to beginning human clinical trials, an IND sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some pre-clinical or non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the pre-clinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30–day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may, at any time, impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with federal regulations and GCP. 
 Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before any clinical trial commences at that institution. All research subjects must provide informed consent, and informed consent information must be submitted to the IRB for approval prior to initiation of the trial. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if adverse events or other certain types of other changes occur. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three phases. A fourth, or post-approval, phase may include additional clinical studies. These phases generally include the following, and may be sequential, or may overlap or be combined: 
 

• | Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are designed to determine the safety of usually single doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting intolerance, as well as evidence of the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Phase 3, if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 (or occasionally Phase 1) studies, the Phase 3 studies will be conducted to further confirm clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded population which may involve geographically diverse clinical trial sites. Generally, but not always, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



18 

  
• | Phase 4 clinical trials are studies required of or agreed to by a sponsor that are conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement. Failure to promptly conduct Phase 4 clinical trials where necessary could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


While Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 tests are generally required for approval of an NDA, certain drugs may not require one or more steps in the process depending on other testing and the situation involved. Additionally, the FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may stop testing at any time if results show patients being exposed to unnecessary health risks or overly dangerous side effects. 
 In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other requirements, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 United States review and approval process 
 FDA approval of an NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the chemistry, manufacture and composition of the product. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of the NDA to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before filing it. The FDA may request additional information rather than file an NDA. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA files it. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The submission of an NDA is also subject to the payment of a substantial application fee (for FDA fiscal year 2021 this fee is $2,875,842), although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, including when the drug that is subject of the application has received Orphan Drug Designation for the indication sought. Further, the sponsor of an approved NDA is subject to an annual program fee, which for FDA fiscal year 2021 is $336,432 per prescription drug product. User fees typically increase annually. The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured to determine whether its manufacturing is cGMP–compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, purity and stability. 
 If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue a complete response letter. The complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and often requires additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even after submitting this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA may withhold approval of a NDA regardless of prior advice it may have provided or commitments it may have made to the sponsor. 
 Once an NDA is approved, changes to the conditions of approval, including additional indications, are made by the submission of a supplement to the NDA. The supplemental NDA, or sNDA, must contain all of the information necessary to support the change. In the case of a new indication, that information usually consists of at least one clinical trial, and often more. Like an NDA, FDA determines whether the sNDA is sufficiently complete to permit review before it files the sNDA. FDA then reviews the sNDA. Like an NDA, FDA can either approve the sNDA or issue a complete response letter outlining the deficiencies in the sNDA. 
 
19 

  Special Protocol Assessments 
 A SPA is a process in which sponsors may request to meet with the FDA to reach agreement on the design and size of certain clinical trials, clinical studies, or animal trials to determine if they adequately address scientific and regulatory requirements. As part of this process, sponsors submit specific questions about protocol design and scientific and regulatory requirements. After the FDA completes the review of a SPA request, the FDA may issue a SPA Letter, including an assessment of the protocol, agreement or non-agreement with the proposed protocol, and answers to the sponsor’s relevant questions. 
 A SPA agreement indicates concurrence by the FDA with the adequacy and acceptability of specific critical elements of overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, dose selection, endpoints, and planned analyses). These elements are critical to ensuring that the trial conducted under the protocol has the potential to support a future submitted application’s ability to meet regulatory requirements for approval. Feedback on these issues provides the greatest benefit to sponsors in planning late-phase development strategy. However, a SPA agreement does not indicate FDA concurrence on every protocol detail. Further, the FDA may rescind a SPA if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the trial began. Thus, a SPA is not binding on the FDA if, for example, the Agency identifies a safety concern related to the product or its pharmacological class, if the FDA or the scientific community recognizes a paradigm shift in disease diagnosis or management, if the relevant data or assumptions provided by the sponsor in the SPA submission are found to be false or misstated, or if the sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of a SPA agreement and the data and results from the applicable clinical trial. 
 Because an SPA provides for the evaluation of protocols for trials that have not been initiated, the conduct and results of the subsequent trial are not part of the evaluation. Therefore, the existence of an SPA agreement does not guarantee that the FDA will accept an NDA, or that the trial results will be adequate to support approval. Those issues are addressed during the review of a submitted application; however, it is hoped that trial quality will be improved by the SPA process. 
 Post-approval requirements and consideration 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may also require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for the healthcare professionals, and other Elements To Assure Safe Use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. 
 Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments 
 Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or approved methods of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug are then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 
20 

  The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 Exclusivity 
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. A drug may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for the previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. During this period of exclusivity, FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. 
 An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2), NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. 
 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness or published literature is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain pre-clinical or clinical studies of the new product. 
 The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three years of marketing exclusivity to the same extent that a Section 505(b)(1) NDA is. 
 
21 

  Abbreviated new drug applications 
 Generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA. The ANDA development process typically does not require new pre-clinical or clinical studies, but it does typically require one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved brand name reference listed drug. Bioequivalence studies compare the bioavailability of the proposed drug product with that of the approved listed product containing the same active ingredient. Bioavailability is a measure of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action. A demonstration of bioequivalence means that the rate and extent of absorption of the ANDA drug is not significantly different from the rate and extent of absorption of the brand name reference listed drug when administered at the same molar dose under similar experimental conditions. 
 As noted above, generic drug products are generally introduced to the marketplace at the expiration of patent protection and non-patent market exclusivity for the reference listed drug. However, if an ANDA applicant is the first ANDA applicant to submit an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification, that ANDA may be eligible for a period of generic marketing exclusivity on approval. This exclusivity, which under certain circumstances must be shared with other ANDA applicants with Paragraph IV certifications, lasts for 180 days, during which the FDA cannot grant final approval to other ANDA sponsors of an application for a generic equivalent to the same reference drug. Under certain circumstances, eligibility for 180-day exclusivity may be forfeited. 
 Various types of changes to an approved ANDA must be requested in a prior approval supplement. In addition, some changes may only be approved only after new bioequivalence studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied. In addition, the ANDA applicant must demonstrate that manufacturing procedures and operations conform to FDA cGMP requirements. Facilities, procedures, operations, and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities. In addition, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and inspections to determine whether the systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. 
 There are also user fees for ANDA applicants, sponsors, and manufacturers. For fiscal year 2021, the application fees are $196,868 per ANDA application and the facility fees are $184,022 per domestic finished dosage form facility, $199,022 per foreign finished dosage form facility, $41,671 per domestic active pharmaceutical ingredient facility, and $56,671 per foreign active pharmaceutical ingredient facility. In addition, there is a new annual program fee based on the size of the generic drug applicant. 
 These user fees typically increase each fiscal year (though they decreased slightly for the 2020 fiscal year). 
 Other regulatory requirements 
 In addition to regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies, we are also subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the marketing of other products. Outside of the United States, our ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory agencies. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, we will only be permitted to commercialize our products if the appropriate regulatory agency is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The regulatory approval and oversight process in other countries includes all of the risks associated with regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies as described above. 
 Under the European Union regulatory system, applications for drug approval may be submitted either in a centralized or decentralized manner. Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the European Medicines Agency leads to an approval granted by the European Commission which permits marketing of the product throughout the European Union. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of nationally approved decisions and is used for products that do not comply with requirements for the centralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, the holders of national marketing authorization in one of the countries within the European Union may submit further applications to other countries within the European Union, who will be requested to recognize the original authorization based on an assessment report provided by the country in which marketing authorization is held. 
 Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 
 In both United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private commercial health insurers and PBMs. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic or other studies in order to further demonstrate the value of our products. Even with the availability of such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than alternative products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our drug candidates, in whole or in part. 
 
22 

  Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”). In fact, there continue to be efforts in Congress to revise the Affordable Care Act and replace it with another law. As a result, there is great uncertainty as to what changes will be made to United States healthcare laws and there can be no assurance how changes to those laws may affect our business. 
 We anticipate that in the United States, Congress, state legislatures, and private sector entities will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures could include: 
 

• | controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | mandatory rebates or additional charges to manufacturers for their products to be covered on Medicare Part D formularies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | controls on healthcare providers;
--+----------------------------------


• | controls on pricing of pharmaceutical products, including the possible reference of the pricing of United States drugs to non-United States drug pricing for the same product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reform of drug importation laws;
--+---------------------------------


• | entering into contractual agreements with payors; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of use of managed-care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects. 
 Further, the pricing of pharmaceutical products generally, and particularly the pricing of orphan drugs, has recently received scrutiny from the press, and from members of Congress in both parties. Some members of the medical community and Senator Bernie Sanders have also made statements in the press on the potential pricing of orphan drugs generally and on the pricing of our product specifically. The impact of this scrutiny on us and on the pricing of orphan drugs and other pharmaceutical products generally cannot be determined with any certainty at this time. 
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity and Pediatric Exclusivity Designation 
 Some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (ODA), the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An Orphan Drug Designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The grant of an Orphan Drug Designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has been granted Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. 
 The orphan drug exclusivity contained in the ODA has been the subject of recent scrutiny from the press, from some members of Congress and from some in the medical community, and a recent proposed change to the ODA would limit the availability of the benefits of the act for drugs that treat more than 200,000 individuals in the United States. There can be no assurance that the exclusivity granted in ODA to orphan drugs approved by the FDA will not be modified in the future, and as to how any such change might affect our products, if approved. 
 
23 

  Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and seven-year orphan exclusivities. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly responds to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. If the FDA determines that information relating to the use of the new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in the population, the clinical study is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request and the reports of FDA-requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application relying on the NDA sponsor’s data. 
 The European Orphan Drug Regulation is considered for drugs intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or very serious condition afflicting five or fewer per 10,000 people in the EU, including compounds that for serious and chronic conditions would likely not be marketed without incentives due to low market return on the sponsor’s development investment. The medicinal product considered should be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Benefits of being granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation are significant, including eight years of data exclusivity, two years of marketing exclusivity and a potential one-year extension of both. The EU Community and Member States may not accept or grant for ten years a new marketing authorization or application for another drug for the same therapeutic indication as the orphan drug, although the ten-year period can be reduced to six years if, after the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of the marketing exclusivity. A supplementary protection certificate may extend the protection six months beyond patent expiration if that is later than the orphan drug exclusivity period. To apply for the supplementary protection, a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, must be included in the market application. In Europe all drugs now seeking marketing authorization need to have a PIP agreed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before it can be approved, even if it is a drug being developed specifically for a pediatric indication. If a product is developed solely for use in the pediatric population, then a Pediatric Use Marketing Authorization, or PUMA, may provide eight years of data exclusivity and ten years of marketing exclusivity. 
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation 
 Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for breakthrough therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A breakthrough therapy designation conveys all of the fast track program features (see below for more details on fast track designation), as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program. The FDA also has an organizational commitment to involve senior management in such guidance. Actions taken to expedite development may include the following actions, as appropriate: 

• | holding meetings with the sponsor and review team throughout the development of the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the non-clinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as possible;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment;

Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. 
 Under the fast track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.

  In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA. 
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Priority Review 
 Under FDA policies, a drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within a six to eight-month time frame from the time a complete NDA is submitted, if the drug candidate is intended for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious or life-threatening condition, demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs. 
 Disclosure of clinical trial information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the clinical trial. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws & the Prescription Drug Marketing Act 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, other state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 
 Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. 
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of approved prescription drugs to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The information reported each year is made publicly available on a searchable website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding their relationships with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives during the previous year.

  In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products, to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states and to report certain pricing information, including price increases. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 
 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the United States Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), has imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. The DSCSA requires product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to eventually establish an electronic interoperable prescription product to system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations on this topic. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers, although FDA regulations addressing wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers have not yet been promulgated. We serialize our product at both the package and homogeneous case level, pass serialization and required transaction information to our customers, and believe that we comply with all such requirements.
