ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Issuer’s Business, Products and Services

Wholly-owned subsidiaries are Medallion Releasing, Inc. (for handling non-Hannover House producer clients), and Bookworks, Inc., a special purpose entity utilized for book publishing activities, as well as to act as the corporate signatory for compliance purposes with the Screen Actors Guild. Both Medallion Releasing, Inc and Bookworks, Inc. are Arkansas domiciled corporations. Income and costs from these two subsidiaries are incorporated into the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 

A. | Describe the issuers’ principal products or services, and their markets 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Company publishes fiction and non-fiction books; Company’s media distribution includes the release of films to theatres, home video, digital streaming formats, television outlets and international licensors. Company is working with Vodwiz, Inc. (which has secured non-affiliate private funding) for the development and launch of a new digital streaming site to be named “MyFlix.” The business model for MyFlix is to consolidate feature films and television series programming owned by a wide range of studios and content owners, into a single destination digital streaming site.
 
The revenue model for MyFlix will be to pay third-party streaming and billing costs off the top and divide remaining revenues on a fifty-fifty basis between the program suppliers and with Vodwiz / MyFlix. Consumers visiting the MyFlix website (or accessing the service through mobile APPS or over-the-top devices such as Roku, AppleTV or hardware installed APPS) can purchase movies or TV episodes on a “per transaction basis” (ala Amazon) or alternatively, can open a monthly subscription with MyFlix for unlimited access to approximately half of the programming otherwise available for per-transaction access. As of the date of this filing, forty-three program suppliers, collectively representing over 15,000 titles, had agreed to participate in the MyFlix service, which would position the site as number two only to Amazon in terms of total programming.
 
The growth of digital streaming services – both as a general market trend and more recently as a preferred media for home access of entertainment products during the COVID-19 pandemic - has created both a boom and bust in the independent film sectors. Consumers are less likely now to purchase DVDs of unknown movies knowing that the same ten-dollar cost could cover a month’s subscription to a service such as Netflix with over 1,000 titles at any given time. As other studios scramble to open “studio specific” streaming services, Hannover House believes that the Vodwiz / MyFlix model is more like the successful Walmart retail strategy of offering a wider selection of programming at everyday low prices. Hannover House has an option to purchase Vodwiz, subject to the achievement of obtainable corporate benchmarks which include the filing of the Form 10 Registration and the resolution or dismissal of four foreign judgments for which the Company has meritorious defenses and legal strategies to oppose.
 
Hannover House, Inc. was originally incorporated in California in September, 1993 under the name of Truman Press, Inc., dba “Hannover House.” The company reincorporated Truman Press, Inc. in the State of Arkansas and operated the company privately until December, 2009 at which time a merger occurred with Wyoming-domiciled Target Development Group, Inc., formerly trading on the OTC Pinksheets under the ticker symbol TDGI. Truman Press, Inc., dba “Hannover House” became the effective surviving entity of the merger with Target Development Group, Inc., and in 2011, the company’s petition to the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency (FINRA) for an official corporate name change and ticker symbol change was approved after a lengthy analysis of the company’s history and activities. At that time, the company’s name was officially certified as “Hannover House, Inc.” and the trading ticker symbol was changed to “HHSE.” A similarly named entity (“Hannover House, Inc.”) was registered many years earlier (2005) in Arkansas, but immediately abandoned within less than thirty (30) days from initial registration, due to a change in the Arkansas film incentives program which no longer provided special benefits to Arkansas-based entities. The 2005 Arkansas filing does not now, nor ever has existed as an operating company. Efforts by the actual and operating Hannover House, Inc. (of Wyoming) to expunge the records of the abandoned Arkansas filing have not succeeded. However, there is substantial public record evidencing that Hannover House, Inc., is the operating, Wyoming corporation, and that no reasonable parties could possibly confuse the robust, publicly-traded Hannover House, Inc., with the similarly named, but non-operating entity abandoned as an Arkansas filing more than 15 years ago.
 
Hannover House, Inc. has released over four hundred titles to the USA Home Video markets since taking on video product distribution activities s in 2002. Some of the better known home video releases include: “TWELVE” from director Joel Schumacher - starring Curtis “50-Cent” Jackson, Zoe Kravitz, Emma Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland; “GRAND CHAMPION” - starring Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts and George Strait; “SAVAGE LAND” – starring Graham Greene, Corbin Bernsen, Vivian Schilling and Charlotte Ross; “TOYS IN THE ATTIC” – starring Forest Whitaker, Joan Cusack and Cary Elwes; and “BONOBOS: BACK TO THE WILD” – starring Luke Evans and Rebecca Hall.
 
Regarding book publishing, Hannover House has achieved best-seller status on both the fiction and non-fiction charts. The best-selling fiction title has been the suspense-thriller, “QUIETUS” by author Vivian Schilling (with over 100,000 copies in print, including mass market editions from Penguin-Putnam and Onyx Publishers); the best-selling Fiction title to date has been “Blood, Money & Power: How L.B.J. Killed J.F.K.” from attorney Barr McClellan (over 120,000 copies in print, inclusive of mass market editions).
 
The company has also released thirty-two feature films to theatres, beginning in 2008 with “HOUNDDOG” a dramatic feature starring Dakota Fanning and Robin Wright, and two top performing feature documentaries, “TURTLE: THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY” (2011) and “ON ANY SUNDAY: THE NEXT CHAPTER” (2014), which was the highest grossing documentary at the U.S. box office that year.

Frederick Shefte (PRESIDENT), each working on an unsalaried basis. The one full-time, short-term employee is Randall Blanton, working as interim Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for a period of between ninety (90) and one-hundred-eighty (180) days or until such time that the company has obtained Directors and Officer’s Liability Insurance (“D&O”) coverage, at which time, Mr. Blanton’s short-term affiliation will be converted into a full-time employment status with a term of at least one (1) year. During the interim process, Mr. Blanton is being paid as an outside contractor at the monthly rate of four-thousand dollars (USD $4,000). Due to a general operational slow-down for new release activities during the COVID pandemic, Mr. Blanton provided no services for the company during Q3 and Q4 of 2020.

During the applicable reporting year, on June 8, 2020 officer D. Frederick Shefte completed a dissolution of marriage with Diana Shefte; under the terms of the divorce settlement, the officer (affiliate) shares beneficially owned by D. Frederick Shefte as listed in the above table, will eventually be transferred to Diana Shefte, under the specific sale restriction rules governing the disposition of affiliate-owned shares under Rule 144. During the current reporting year, the Shefte shares were divided as follows: 6,743,773 remaining in the existing legend fbo Don Frederick Shefte, and 24,737,773 retitled to be named exclusively for Diana B. Shefte. Under rules and regulations governing the sale, transfer or hypothecation of officer-owned shares, those shares now issued for Diana B. Shefte will be subject to the restrictions in place for officer shares. On Feb 8, 2021, within sixty days of the applicable time period covered by this 10-K report, Don Frederick Shefte filed for personal bankruptcy. Corporate counsel does not believe that Shefte’s bankruptcy will result in any attempt to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of the 6,743,773 restricted shares in Shefte’s name, due to legal sales restrictions governing officer and affiliate-owned shares under Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933.

Response: On October 8, 2019, Company was advised of an order from the Arkansas Securities Commission regarding the issuance of a convertible debt instrument to JSJ Investments, Inc. in 2014, which transaction was not registered with the Arkansas Securities Commission. Company was ordered to not issue any additional convertible debt instruments from within the State of Arkansas if such instruments are not registered within the State of Arkansas Securities Commission. Company was advised on a call with the Commission on October 10, 2019 that this policy in Arkansas is effective until such time that the Company is otherwise a fully reporting and registered with the Securities & Exchange Commission. Company has requested an appeal and administrative hearing to remove the order on multiple causes of action. The initial step of the appeal process occurred in late November 2019, at which time, a representative of the Arkansas Dept. of Securities concurred that the transaction in question was not with an Arkansas resident or Arkansas entity, and therefore may not be subject to Arkansas Laws. A December 2020 zoom call was rescheduled to accommodate counsel’s availability. There will be an additional appeal process hearing at such time that the COVID-19 pandemic shut-down of courthouses and non-essential hearings has been lifted. Based upon prior calls with the Arkansas Securities Commission and with appropriate counsel, Company will present the appropriate evidence at this upcoming hearing that should result in a dismissal of the Arkansas C&D order. As of the filing of this annual report, the next opportunity to review and dismiss the C&D order will occur via “Zoom” conference in mid-April (2021) at a date and time still awaiting final confirmation.
