Item 1 — Business
General
NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading integrated power company built on the strength of the nation's largest and most diverse competitive electric generation portfolio and leading retail electricity platform. NRG aims to create a sustainable energy future by producing, selling and delivering electricity and related products and services in major competitive power markets in the U.S. in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. The Company owns and operates approximately 47,000 MW of generation; engages in the trading of wholesale energy, capacity and related products; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the names “NRG”, "Reliant" and other retail brand names owned by NRG. NRG was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 29, 1992.
Strategy
NRG's strategy is to maximize stockholder value through the safe production and sale of reliable and affordable power to its customers in the markets served by the Company, while positioning the Company to meet the market's increasing demand for sustainable, low carbon and customized energy solutions for the benefit of the end-use energy consumer. This strategy is intended to enable the Company to achieve sustainable growth at reasonable margins while de-risking the Company in terms of reduced and mitigated exposure both to environmental risk and cyclical commodity price risk. At the same time, the Company's relentless commitment to safety for its employees, customers and partners continues unabated.
To effectuate the Company’s strategy, NRG is focused on: (i) excellence in operating performance of its existing assets including repowering its power generation assets at premium sites and optimal hedging of generation assets and retail load operations; (ii) serving the energy needs of end-use residential, commercial and industrial customers in competitive markets through multiple brands and channels with a variety of retail energy products and services differentiated by innovative features, premium service, sustainability, and loyalty/affinity programs; (iii) investing in alternative power generation technologies in its wholesale business, like wind and solar, and deploying innovative energy solutions for consumers within its retail businesses; and (iv) engaging in a proactive capital allocation plan focused on achieving the regular return of and on stockholder capital within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management, including pursuing selective acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and investments. 
Business Overview
The Company’s core businesses include wholesale conventional generation, retail electricity including personal power solutions and Business Solutions (included in the Retail segment, effective in January 2017), contracted generation owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the NRG Yield segment) and renewable utility scale and distributed generation assets that are constructed or in development and that are not otherwise owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the Renewables segment).
Generation
The Company’s wholesale power generation business includes the Company's wholesale operations including plant operations, commercial operations, EPC, energy services and other critical related functions. In addition to the traditional functions, the wholesale power generation business also includes NRG’s conventional distributed generation business, consisting of reliability, combined heat and power and large-scale distributed generation. 
The wholesale generation business is capital-intensive and commodity-driven with numerous industry participants that compete on the basis of the location of their plants, fuel mix, plant efficiency and the reliability of the services offered. The Company has one of the largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in the U.S., with approximately 42,000 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear generation capacity at 85 plants as of December 31, 2016. The Company's power generation assets are diversified by fuel-type, dispatch level and region, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. NRG's U.S. baseload and intermediate facilities provide the Company with a significant source of cash flow, while its peaking facilities provide NRG with opportunities to capture significant upside potential that can arise during periods of high demand, which typically drive higher energy prices. As of December 31, 2016, less than 25% of the Company's consolidated operating revenues were derived from coal-fired operating assets.

Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is currently highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the companies the Company competes with depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives and other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions. Many of the Company's generation assets, however, are located within densely populated areas that tend to have higher wholesale pricing as a result of relatively favorable local supply-demand balance. The Company has generation assets located in or near Houston, New York City, Chicago, Washington D.C., New Jersey, southwestern Connecticut, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and the Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco metropolitan areas. These facilities, some of which are aging, are often ideally situated for repowering or the addition of new capacity because their location and existing infrastructure give them significant advantages over undeveloped sites. The Company believes that its extensive generation portfolio provides many asset optimization opportunities. During 2016, the Company completed gas conversion projects on facilities totaling more than 2,200 MW. The Company currently has over 1,000 MW targeted for Repowering initiatives, all of which are under development or construction. 
In addition, the Company continuously evaluates opportunities for development of new generation, on both a merchant and contracted basis. As such, the majority of the Company's current developments are in response to RFPs for new generation and/or generating capacity backed by contracts with credit-worthy counterparties.  Many RFPs are issued by regulated utilities or electric system operators in response to reliability or renewable power mandates.  The Company competes against other power plant developers when responding to these RFPs.  The number and type of competitors vary based on the location, generation type, project size and counterparty specified in the RFP.  Bids are awarded based on many factors including price, location of existing generation, prior experience developing generation resources similar to that specified in the RFP, and creditworthiness. 
Retail 
Retail provides energy and related services as well as personal power to Mass Market consumers through various brands and sales channels across the U.S. Retail also includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products which are within NRG's Business Solutions group. In 2016, Retail delivered approximately 42 TWhs and served approximately 2.8 million mass Recurring Customers. Retail's results make it the largest competitive Mass Market energy retailer in the U.S. and Texas, and one of the top six Mass Market energy retailers in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. The majority of Retail's sales come in the competitive retail energy markets of Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, as well as the District of Columbia. 
Mass Market consumers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, customer service, brand, product choices and value-added features. These consumers purchase products through a variety of sales channels, including direct sales, call centers, websites, brokers and brick-and-mortar stores. Through its broad range of service offerings and value propositions, Retail is able to attract, retain, and increase the value of its customer relationships. Retail's brands are recognized for exemplary customer service, innovative smart energy and technology product offerings and environmentally friendly solutions. 
Included in Retail is the Company's Business Solutions group, which focuses on providing distributed products and services as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power or other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid. These solutions include system power, distributed generation, solar and wind products, carbon management and specialty services, backup generation, storage and distributed solar, demand response and energy efficiency. In providing on-site energy solutions, the Company often benefits from its ability to supply energy products from its wholesale generation portfolio to commercial and industrial retail customers. 
The Company also provides energy services including operations, maintenance, technical, development and asset management services to its own facilities and to external customers. 
11


Renewables
The Company’s renewables business focuses on the acquisition, development and operation and maintenance of utility scale wind and solar, community solar and distributed solar generation assets as well as the management and operations of the renewable generation assets owned by NRG Yield, Inc. A substantial portion of the utility scale wind and solar generation facilities contained within the Company’s renewables business are subject to the ROFO Agreement between the Company and NRG Yield, Inc. In 2016, the Company acquired 1,637 MW of utility scale solar and wind projects and 107 MW of distributed generation and community solar projects that are currently under development or in operation across 12 states. The renewables business has in-house expertise that covers the full spectrum of development capabilities to execute on utility, distributed generation, and community solar projects. The asset management and operations and maintenance groups within the renewables business manage a portfolio of wind and solar assets across 26 states, serving as the primary commercial asset manager on the vast majority of assets owned by NRG and NRG Yield, Inc. In addition, the operations and maintenance groups self-perform plant operations on 2,675 MW on the consolidated fleet of assets owned by NRG and NRG Yield, Inc. and 224 MW on assets owned by third parties.
The utility wind and solar generation business targets strategic partnerships with utilities, municipalities and large national corporations for offsite wind and solar solutions. The distributed solar business targets partnerships with companies, municipalities, schools and communities to provide on-site and virtual net metering off-site renewable generation. The community solar business targets relationships with companies and municipalities as well as residential homeowners to provide off-site solar generation under community solar regulations and tariffs. In addition to assets in operation, as of December 31, 2016, the Company held a backlog of in-construction, contracted and awarded projects of 543 MW, and a pipeline of 3,268 MW across the utility and distributed solar renewables markets. 
Similar to the wholesale business, the renewables business also competes for new generation opportunities through both RFPs and bilateral solicitations. The renewables business selects markets and projects to compete based on resource relative to the value of the power, while seeking to make use of NRG capabilities in a competitive landscape. The number and type of competitors vary based on location, generation type, project size and counterparty.  The renewables business competes with traditional utilities as well as companies that provide products and services in the downstream solar and wind energy value chains. 
NRG Yield
NRG Yield, Inc. is a publicly-traded, dividend growth-oriented company formed to serve as the primary vehicle through which NRG owns, operates and acquires diversified contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets. As of December 31, 2016, NRG owns a 55.1% voting interest in the outstanding common stock of NRG Yield, Inc. NRG Yield, Inc.’s contracted generation portfolio collectively represents 4,563 net MW as of December 31, 2016. Each of the assets sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term, fixed price offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. NRG Yield, Inc. also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,319 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 123 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot water and/or chilled water, and in some instances electricity, to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.
NRG Yield, Inc. provides the Company with a more competitive cost of capital consistent with the lower risk profile of long-term contracted or regulated assets. As such, NRG believes that it directly benefits from NRG Yield, Inc.’s growth through its controlling interest in NRG Yield, Inc. and by providing NRG Yield, Inc. a platform of growth through the completion of future sales of assets pursuant to the ROFO Agreement. The proceeds of such future sales are expected to provide the Company with a portion of the capital utilized under its capital allocation program.

GenOn Liquidity
As disclosed in Item 15 - Note 1, Nature of Business, and Note 12, Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, $691 million of GenOn's Senior Notes, excluding $8 million of associated premiums, are current within the GenOn consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and are due on June 15, 2017. GenOn's future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn. Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity to repay the Senior Notes due in June 2017. As a result of these factors, there is substantial doubt about GenOn's ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of the substantial doubt about GenOn’s ability to continue as a going concern, along with additional factors, there is substantial doubt about certain of GenOn’s subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going concern. 
The Company, GenOn's parent company, has no obligation to provide any financial support to GenOn other than under the secured intercompany revolving credit agreement between the Company and GenOn and NRG Americas. As of December 31, 2016, $228 million was available to be used by GenOn under the $500 million revolving credit agreement. As controlled group members, ERISA requires that NRG and GenOn are jointly and severally liable for the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan, including the pension liabilities associated with GenOn employees.
GenOn is currently considering all options available to it, including negotiations with creditors, refinancing the GenOn Senior Notes, potential sales of certain generating assets as well as the possibility for a need to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. During 2016, GenOn appointed two independent directors, retained advisors and established a separate audit committee as part of this process. Any resolution may have a material impact on the Company's statement of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
As of December 31, 2016, GenOn represents 15.6% of the Company's consolidated total assets, 16.9% of the Company's consolidated total liabilities and contributed $94 million to the Company's consolidated cash from operations in 2016.
NRG Operations
The NRG businesses described above are all supported through the NRG operational infrastructure, which begins with the Company’s asset fleet and the associated commercial and retail operations. The images below illustrate NRG's U.S. power generation and net capacity capabilities as of December 31, 2016, as well as customer, load and regional information surrounding the operation of NRG’s retail businesses:

NRG's portfolio diversification and commercial operations hedging strategy provides the Company with reliable future cash flows.  NRG has hedged a portion of its coal and nuclear capacity with decreasing hedge levels through 2021. Over a third of the Company's generation is in markets with forward capacity markets that extend three years into the future. These capacity revenues not only enhance the reliability of future cash flows but are not correlated to natural gas prices. NRG also has cooperative load contract obligations in the Gulf Coast region extending through various dates in 2025, which largely hedges a portion of the Company's generation in this region. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, the Company had purchased fuel forward under fixed price contracts, with contractually-specified price escalators, for approximately 30% of its expected coal requirement from 2017 to 2021. The Company enters into additional hedges when it deems market conditions to be favorable. 
The Company also has the advantage of being able to supply its retail businesses with its own generation, which can reduce the need to sell and buy power from other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in lower transaction costs and credit exposures. This combination of generation and retail allows for a reduction in actual and contingent collateral, through offsetting transactions and by reducing the need to hedge the retail power supply through third parties. 
The generation and retail combination also provides stability in cash flows, as changes in commodity prices generally have offsetting impacts between the two businesses. The offsetting nature of generation and retail, in relation to changes in market prices, is an integral part of NRG's goal of providing a reliable source of future cash flow for the Company. 
15


When developing new renewable and conventional power generation facilities, NRG typically secures long-term PPAs, which insulate the Company from commodity market volatility and provide future cash flow stability. These PPAs are typically contracted with high credit quality local utilities and typically have durations from 10 years to as much as 25 years. 
Commercial Operations Overview
NRG seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility through the marketing, trading and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services into spot, intermediate and long-term markets and through the active management and trading of emissions allowances, fuel supplies and transportation-related services. The Company's principal objectives are the realization of the full market value of its asset base, including the capture of its extrinsic value, the management and mitigation of commodity market risk and the reduction of cash flow volatility over time.
NRG enters into power sales and hedging arrangements via a wide range of products and contracts, including PPAs, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, natural gas derivative instruments and other financial instruments. In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward sales contracts to manage the commodity price risk primarily associated with the Company's coal and nuclear generation assets. The objective of these hedging strategies is to stabilize the cash flow generated by NRG's portfolio of assets. 
NRG also trades electric power, natural gas and related commodity and financial products, including forwards, futures, options and swaps, through its ownership of BETM, which is also an energy management service provider for primarily third-party generating assets. Certain other NRG entities trade to a lesser extent, utilizing similar products as well as oil and weather products. The Company seeks to generate profits from volatility in the price of electricity, capacity, fuels and transmission congestion by buying and selling contracts in wholesale markets under guidelines approved by the Company's risk management committee. 
Coal and Nuclear Operations
The following table summarizes NRG's U.S. coal and nuclear capacity and the corresponding revenues and average natural gas prices and positions resulting from coal and nuclear hedge agreements extending beyond December 31, 2016 and through 2020 for the Company's Gulf Coast region:

Capacity and Other Contracted Revenue Sources
NRG's revenues and cash flows benefit from capacity/demand payments and other contracted revenue sources, originating from market clearing capacity prices, Resource Adequacy contracts, tolling arrangements, PPAs and other long-term contractual arrangements: 

• | Capacity auctions — The Company's largest sources of capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM, ISO-NE, and NYISO. Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time performance, where NRG's actual revenues will be the combination of revenues based on the cleared auction MWs plus the net of any over- and under-performance of NRG's fleet. In addition, MISO has an annual auction, known as the Planning Resource Auction, or PRA. The Gulf Coast assets situated in the MISO market may participate in this auction. Recent changes have made the decision to import external capacity into the PJM market more complicated, and the Company is evaluating the feasibility of continuing to import. 


• | Resource Adequacy and bilateral contracts — In California, there is a resource adequacy requirement that is satisfied through bilateral contracts. The Company's newer generation in California is contracted under long-term tolling agreements. Certain other sites in California have short-term tolling agreements or resource adequacy contracts. In addition, NRG earns demand payments from its long-term full-requirements load contracts with nine Louisiana distribution cooperatives, which expire in 2025. NRG also had full requirements contracts in PJM in 2016. Demand payments from the current long-term contracts are tied to summer peak demand and provide a mechanism for recovering a portion of the costs associated with new or changed environmental laws or regulations. In Texas, capacity and contracted revenues are through bilateral contracts with load serving entities. 


• | Long-term PPAs — Output from the majority of renewable energy assets and certain conventional energy plants is sold through long-term PPAs and tolling agreements to a single counterparty, which is often a utility or commercial customer.

Fuel Supply and Transportation
NRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel (including coal, natural gas and oil) and nuclear fuel. The prices of fossil fuels are highly volatile. The Company obtains its fossil fuels from multiple suppliers and through multiple transporters. Although availability is generally not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability, delays arising from extreme weather conditions and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are fairly uniform across the Company's business segments and fuel products used.
Coal — The Company believes it is adequately hedged, using forward coal supply agreements, for its domestic coal consumption for 2017. NRG actively manages its coal requirements based on forecasted generation, market volatility and its inventory on site. As of December 31, 2016, NRG had purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for approximately 27% of the Company's expected requirements from 2017 through 2021, including expected coal inventory draw down. NRG purchased approximately 25 million tons of coal in 2016, of which 84% was Powder River Basin coal and lignite. For fuel transport, NRG has entered into various rail and barge transportation and rail car lease agreements with varying tenures that provide for most of the Company's transportation requirements of Powder River Basin coal for the next 5 years and for all of the Company's transportation requirements of Appalachian and Colorado coal for the next two years. 
The following table shows the percentage of the Company's coal requirements from 2017 through 2021 that have been purchased forward as of December 31, 2016:

 | Percentage ofCompany'sRequirement (a)
2017 | 95 | %
2018 | 41 | %
2019 | — | %
2020 | — | %
2021 | — | %


(a) | Includes expected coal inventory draw down.

Natural Gas — NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants across all its U.S. wholesale regions. Fuel needs are managed on a spot basis, especially for peaking assets, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for these types of units, the dispatch of which is highly unpredictable. The Company contracts for natural gas storage services as well as natural gas transportation services to deliver natural gas when needed.
Nuclear Fuel — STP's owners satisfy their fuel supply requirements by: (i) acquiring uranium concentrates and contracting for conversion of the uranium concentrates into uranium hexafluoride; (ii) contracting for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. Through its proportionate participation in STPNOC, which is the NRC-licensed operator of STP and responsible for all aspects of fuel procurement, NRG is party to a number of long-term forward purchase contracts with many of the world's largest suppliers covering STP's requirements for uranium concentrates with only approximately 25% of STP's requirements outstanding for the duration of the operating license. Similarly, NRG is party to long-term contracts to procure STP's requirements for conversion and enrichment services and fuel fabrication for the life of the operating license.
Retail Operations
In 2016, NRG's retail businesses sold electricity to residential, commercial and industrial consumers at either fixed, indexed or variable prices. Residential and smaller commercial consumers typically contract for terms ranging from one month to two years while industrial contracts are often between one year and five years in length. In 2016, NRG's retail businesses sold approximately 61 TWhs of electricity. In any given year, the quantity of TWhs sold can be affected by weather, economic conditions and competition. The wholesale supply is typically purchased as the load is contracted from a combination of NRG's wholesale portfolio and other third parties. The ability to choose supply from the market or the Company's portfolio allows for an optimal combination to support and stabilize retail margins.

Operational Statistics
The following are industry statistics for the Company's fossil and nuclear plants, as defined by the NERC, and are more fully described below:
Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or EAF — Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be provided over a defined period of time after all types of outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken into account.
Net Heat Rate — The net heat rate represents the total amount of fuel in BTU required to generate one net kWh provided.
Net Capacity Factor — The net amount of electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used during generation.
The tables below present these performance metrics for the Company's U.S. power generation portfolio, including leased facilities and those accounted for through equity method investments, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

Segment Review
The Company's segment structure reflects how management currently makes financial decisions and allocates resources. During January 2017, the Company's businesses are segregated as follows: Generation (previously named Generation/Business), which includes generation, international and BETM (previously part of Corporate); Retail (previously named Retail Mass) which includes Mass customers (previously NRG Home Retail), and Business Solutions, which includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products (previously in the Generation segment); Renewables (previously named NRG Renew), which includes solar and wind assets, excluding those in NRG Yield; NRG Yield; and corporate activities. The Company's corporate segment include residential solar (previously part of NRG Home) and electric vehicle services. During 2016, the Company began reporting the results of its residential solar business in its corporate segment and its international business in its Generation segment. Intersegment sales are accounted for at market. The Company has recast data from prior periods to reflect changes in reportable segments to conform to the current year presentation. NRG Yield includes certain of the Company's contracted generation assets. On September 1, 2016, NRG Yield acquired the remaining 51.05% interest in CVSR Holdco LLC, which indirectly owns the CVSR solar facility, from the Company. This acquisition was accounted for as transfers of entities under common control and accordingly, all historical periods have been recast to reflect this change.

Seasonality and Price Volatility
Annual and quarterly operating results of the Company's wholesale power generation segments can be significantly affected by weather, including wind resource availability, and energy commodity price volatility. Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the Company's wholesale generation business segments.
The sale of electric power to retail customers is also a seasonal business with the demand for power generally peaking during the summer months. As a result, net working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer months along with the higher revenues, and then decline during off-peak months. Weather may impact operating results and extreme weather conditions could materially affect results of operations. The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power prices and market dynamics like the price of natural gas, transmission constraints, competitor actions, and changes in market heat rates.
Market Framework 
Organized Energy Markets in CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM 
The majority of NRG's fleet operates in one of the organized energy markets, known as RTOs or ISOs. Each organized market administers day-ahead and real-time centralized bid-based energy and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market participants make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price, or LMP. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power. These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates. 
Other than ERCOT, each of the ISO regions also operates a capacity or resource adequacy market that provides an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets. The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations. 
Gulf Coast
NRG's Gulf Coast wholesale power generation business is principally located in the ERCOT and MISO markets.  The ERCOT market is one of the nation's largest and historically fastest growing power markets.  ERCOT is an energy only market, and has implemented market rule changes to provide pricing more reflective of higher energy value when operating reserves are scarce or constrained.  NRG also operates generation assets that are principally located within MISO, participating in the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, MISO employs a one-year forward resource adequacy construct, in which capacity resources can compete for fixed cost recovery in the capacity auction.  NRG continues to provide full requirements service to LSEs, including cooperatives and municipalities in the MISO region.
22


East
NRG's generation and demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM. Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, the East region receives a significant portion of its revenues from capacity markets in ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM. PJM and ISO-NE use a three-year forward capacity auction construct, while NYISO uses a month-ahead capacity auction construct. Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity. Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance. In such markets, NRG’s actual revenues will be the combination of cleared auction prices times the quantity of MWs cleared, plus the net of any over-performance “bonus payments” and any under-performance charges. In both markets, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids. 
West 
NRG operates a fleet of natural gas fired facilities located entirely within the CAISO footprint. The CAISO operates day-ahead and real-time locational markets for energy and ancillary services, while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices. The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale of power, ancillary services and capacity products at market-based rates, either within the CAISO's centralized energy and ancillary service markets or bilaterally pursuant to tolling arrangements or other capacity sales with California's LSEs. The CPUC also determines capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO. Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas. Additionally, the CAISO has independent authority to contract with needed resources under certain circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly. NRG is also pursuing Repowering projects at several southern California sites pursuant to long-term contracts. 
Renewables
NRG operates a fleet of utility scale and distributed renewable generating assets across the U.S. Many states have implemented their own renewable portfolio standards requiring LSEs to provide a given percentage of their energy sales from renewable resources. As a result, a number of LSEs have entered into long-term PPAs with the NRG's utility scale renewable generating facilities. There are examples of states increasing their RPS from initially stated levels, such as California’s recently enacted 50% RPS by 2030 and Hawaii’s goal of achieving 100% renewables by 2045. In addition, given the cost competitiveness of renewables, LSEs are procuring renewables in excess of their RPS obligations. In December 2015, the U.S. Congress extended the 30% solar ITC so that projects which begin construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC.  Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22%, respectively.  The same legislation also extended the 10-year wind PTC for wind projects which begin construction in years 2016 through 2019.  Wind projects which begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTC at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kWh, respectively. 
Retail 
NRG's retail businesses sell energy and related services as well as portable power and battery solutions to customers across the country. In most of the states that have introduced retail competition, NRG's retail businesses competitively offer retail power, natural gas, portable power or other value-enhancing services to end-use customers. Each retail choice state establishes its own retail competition laws and regulations, and the specific operational, licensing, and compliance requirements vary on a state-by-state basis. In the East markets, incumbent utilities currently provide default service and as a result typically serve a majority of residential customers. In Texas, NRG’s retail business activities are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the PUCT and ERCOT, including the requirement for retailers to be certified by the PUCT in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity. A majority of the retail load is in the ERCOT market region and is served by competitive retail suppliers, except certain areas that are served by municipal utilities and electric cooperatives that have not opted into competitive choice. Regulated terms and conditions of default service, as well as any movement to replace default service with competitive services, as is done in ERCOT, can affect customer participation in retail competition. The attractiveness of NRG's retail offerings in each state may be impacted by the rules, regulations, market structure and communication requirements from public utility commissions across the country.
23


Regulatory Matters 
As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and retail energy markets, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generating, thermal, or distributed generation assets are located. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the states in which NRG entities are licensed to sell at retail. NRG must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates.
NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.
Federal Regulation
CFTC
The CFTC, among other things, regulates the trading of swaps, futures and many commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA. Since 2010, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the U.S. and internationally. These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption of additional regulations, including any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact NRG’s ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting NRG’s ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions.
FERC
FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale by public utilities of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA. Under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a QF under PURPA. The transmission of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC's rate jurisdiction under Sections 203 or 205 of the FPA. Each of NRG's non-ERCOT U.S. generating facilities either qualifies as a QF, or the subsidiary owning the facility qualifies as an EWG.
Public utilities are required to obtain FERC's acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. Generally all of NRG's non-QF generating and power marketing entities located outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates.
Current Administration and Changeover at FERC — FERC is currently without a quorum and cannot issue orders in contested proceedings until a new Commissioner is appointed. FERC’s day-to-day work can continue through authority that has been delegated to FERC Staff. With a new administration and three vacant positions at FERC, NRG’s business may be affected because its generation fleet is subject to changes in FERC regulatory policy.
State Regulation
In Texas, NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.
In New York, NRG's generation subsidiaries are electric corporations subject to "lightened" regulation by the NYSPSC. As such, the NYSPSC exercises its jurisdictional authority over certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including safety, retirements, and the issuance of debt secured by recourse to NRG's generation assets located in New York. NRG currently has blanket authorization from the NYSPSC for the issuance of $15 billion of debt. Additionally, the NYSPSC has provided GenOn Bowline with a separate debt authorization of $1.488 billion. 
In California, NRG's generation subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the CPUC with regard to certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including health and safety, outage reporting and other aspects of the facilities' operations. Additionally, the competitiveness of many of NRG's new businesses depends on state competition and other policies.

Nuclear Operations
NRG South Texas LP is a 44% owner of a joint undivided interest in STP, the other owners of STP being the City of Austin, Texas (16%) and the City Public Service Board of San Antonio (40%). STP Nuclear Operating Company, or STPNOC, was founded by the then-owners in 1997 to operate the plant and it is the operator licensee and holder of the Facility Operating Licenses NPF-76 and NPF-80. STPNOC is a nonstock, nonprofit, nonmember corporation. Each owner of STP appoints a board member (and the three directors then choose a fourth director who also serves as the chief executive officer of STPNOC). A participation agreement establishes an owners' committee with voting interests consistent with ownership interests. 
As a holder of an ownership interest in STP, NRG South Texas LP is an NRC licensee and is subject to NRC regulation. The NRC license gives the Company the right only to possess an interest in STP but not to operate it. As a possession-only licensee, i.e., non-operating co-owner, the NRC's regulation of NRG South Texas LP is primarily focused on the Company's ability to meet its financial and decommissioning funding assurance obligations. In connection with the NRC license, the Company and its subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide up to $120 million to support operations at STP. 
 Decommissioning Trusts — Upon expiration of the operating licenses for the two generating units at STP, currently scheduled for 2027 and 2028, the co-owners of STP are required under federal law to decontaminate and decommission the STP facility. Under NRC regulations, a power reactor licensee generally must pre-fund the full amount of its estimated NRC decommissioning obligations unless it is a rate-regulated utility, or a state or municipal entity that sets its own rates, or has the benefit of a state-mandated non-bypassable charge available to periodically fund the decommissioning trust such that the trust, plus allowable earnings, will equal the estimated decommissioning obligations by the time the decommissioning is expected to begin.
 NRG South Texas LP, through its 44% ownership interest, is the beneficiary of decommissioning trusts that have been established to provide funding for decontamination and decommissioning of STP. CenterPoint and AEP collect, through rates or other authorized charges to their electric utility customers, amounts designated for funding NRG South Texas LP's portion of the decommissioning of the facility. See also Item 15 — Note 6, Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
In the event that the funds from the trusts are ultimately determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the original owners of the Company's STP interests, CenterPoint and AEP, each will be required to collect, through their PUCT-authorized non-bypassable rates or other charges to customers, additional amounts required to fund NRG South Texas LP's obligations relating to the decommissioning of the facility. Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, those excesses will be refunded to the respective rate payers of CenterPoint or AEP, or their successors. 
STP License Amendment — STP Unit 1 was operating with a single-cycle license amendment issued on December 11, 2015 after a control rod was determined to be inoperable following a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. The approved license amendment to support STP Unit 1 operation with the inoperable control rod and the associated control rod drive shaft removed was granted by the NRC on December 21, 2016.

 Regional Regulatory Developments
NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions. For further discussion on regulatory developments see Item 15 — Note 23, Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
East Region
PJM 
2019/2020 PJM Auction Results — On May 24, 2016, PJM announced the results of its 2019/2020 base residual auction. NRG cleared approximately 11,155 MW of Capacity Performance product and 371 MW of Base Capacity product in the 2019/2020 base residual auction. NRG’s expected capacity revenues from the base residual auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year are approximately $569 million. 
The table below provides a detailed description of NRG’s 2019/2020 base residual auction results from May 24, 2016:

PJM Capacity Performance Appeals — On or about July 8, 2016, four petitions were filed at the D.C. Circuit seeking review of the FERC orders approving PJM’s Capacity Performance revisions to its forward capacity market after motions for rehearing at FERC were denied on May 10, 2016. NRG intervened in these matters on July 29, 2016. On December 9, 2016, NRG, along with other generators and industry trade groups, filed a joint brief in support of FERC's decision. Briefing is complete and oral argument occurred in February 2017. This case governs capacity revenues already received by NRG, as well as the revenues for forward periods.
PJM Seasonal Capacity Proceeding — On November 17, 2016, PJM proposed to enhance the ability of capacity storage resources, intermittent resources, demand response, energy efficiency, and environmentally limited resources, or collectively the seasonal capacity performance resources, to participate in the BRA and qualify as a resource providing the capacity performance product through aggregation. NRG filed comments specifically supporting PJM’s proposal to modify the aggregation rules to allow seasonal capacity resources to aggregate across LDAs and to allow aggregations through RPM auctions. On January 23, 2017, PJM amended its proposal to address questions from FERC. The outcome of this proceeding could have a material impact on future PJM capacity prices.
Complaints Related to Extension of Base Capacity — In 2015, FERC approved changes to PJM’s capacity market, which included moving from the Base Capacity product to the higher performance Capacity Performance product over the course of a five year transition. Under this transition, as of the May 2017 BRA, the Base Capacity product will no longer be available.  Several parties have filed complaints at FERC seeking to maintain the RPM Base Capacity product for at least one more delivery year or until such time as PJM develops a model for seasonal resources to participate. If the transition is delayed, capacity prices could be materially impacted. The matters are pending at FERC.  
MOPR Revisions — On May 2, 2013, FERC accepted PJM's proposal to substantially revise its Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR.  Among other things, FERC approved the portions of the PJM proposal that exempt many new entrants from demonstrating that their proposed projects are economic, as well as providing a similar exemption for public power entities and certain self-supply entities. This exemption is subject to certain conditions designed to limit the financial incentive of such entities to suppress market prices. On June 3, 2013, NRG filed a request for rehearing of the FERC order and subsequently protested the manner in which PJM proposed to implement the FERC order. On October 15, 2015, FERC denied the requests for rehearing and accepted PJM’s compliance filing.  NRG, along with other parties, filed a petition for review of FERC's decision with the D.C. Circuit. Briefing is complete. The case is pending at the D.C. Circuit.

Illinois Zero Emission Credit Legislation and Related PJM Complaint — Pursuant to legislation in Illinois, the Illinois Power Agency is to procure contracts for Zero Emission Credits, or ZECs, through a process that would take into account environmental benefits, including the preservation of zero emission facilities. The procurement would be subject to review by the Illinois Commerce Commission. These ZECs are out-of-market subsidies that threaten to artificially suppress prices in the PJM auctions.  On February 14, 2017, NRG, along with other companies, filed a complaint in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois; another plaintiff group filed a similar complaint on the same day.  
As a result of the ZEC scheme adopted by the Illinois legislature and to address the effect of subsidies set to be paid to Illinois to certain nuclear units, on January 9, 2017, NRG and other generators and its trade association filed a joint amendment to the pending complaint seeking to apply the MOPR in the capacity market to existing resources that receive out-of-market subsidies. This amendment is to the March 21, 2016 complaint filed by NRG and other companies related to ratepayer-funded subsidies approved by the PUCO.
Midwest Generation, LLC Reactive Power Compensation — On June 21, 2016, FERC issued an order directing MWG to make a compliance filing setting forth refunds for payments received in violation of its 2004 reactive power settlement or to show cause why it has not violated the settlement. FERC also ordered MWG to revise its tariff to reflect the costs of units continuing to provide reactive power or show cause why it should not be required to do so. The Commission also referred this matter to the Commission's Office of Enforcement. On June 30, 2016, MWG filed a revised tariff, and on July 22, 2016, MWG made a compliance filing as ordered by FERC. On October 13, 2016, FERC found that MWG should only be liable for refunds that accrued after bankruptcy on April 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016. MWG is currently in settlement discussions regarding its revised reactive power schedule. The matter is still pending at the Commission's Office of Enforcement. 
New England
2020/2021 ISO-NE Auction Results — On February 6, 2017, ISO-NE announced the results of its 2020/2021 forward capacity auction. NRG cleared 2,641 MW at $5.297 KW per month providing expected annual capacity revenues of $167.9 million. The 333 MWs at Canal Unit 3, which previously cleared the tenth forward capacity auction with a seven year price lock at a price of $7.17 KW per month for the 2020/2021 deliverability year, are excluded from these results. 
Peak Energy Rent Adjustment Complaint — On September 30, 2016, the New England Power Generators Association, or NEPGA, filed a complaint against ISO-NE asking FERC to find the Peak Energy Rent, or PER, unjust and unreasonable. On January 9, 2017, FERC granted NEPGA’s complaint requiring a change to how the PER strike price is calculated and determine any refunds during the time period provided for in the complaint. The first FERC-ordered settlement conference occurred on February 16, 2017.
Performance Incentive Proposal — On January 17, 2014, ISO-NE filed at FERC to revise its forward capacity market, or FCM, by making a resource’s forward capacity market compensation dependent on resource output during short intervals of operating reserve scarcity. The ISO-NE proposal would replace the existing shortage event penalty structure with a new performance incentive mechanism, resulting in capacity payments to resources that would be the combination of two components: (1) a base capacity payment and (2) a performance payment or charge. The performance payment or charge would be entirely dependent upon the resource’s delivery of energy or operating reserves during scarcity conditions, and could be larger than the base payment.
On May 30, 2014, FERC found that most of the provisions in the ISO-NE proposal, with modifications, together with an increase to the reserve constraint penalty factors, provided a just and reasonable structure. FERC instituted a proceeding for further hearings and required ISO-NE to make a compliance filing to modify its proposal and adopt the increases to the reserve constraint penalty factors. FERC denied rehearing. The NEPGA filed a petition for review of FERC's decision with the D.C. Circuit. Briefing is complete. 
New York
Dunkirk Power Reliability Service and Natural Gas Addition — On February 13, 2014, Dunkirk Power LLC and National Grid agreed to a term sheet for a 10-year agreement to govern the addition of natural gas-burning capabilities to the Dunkirk facility. This term sheet, known as the DNG Agreement Term Sheet, was approved by the NYSPSC on June 13, 2014. On February 27, 2015, Entergy filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York alleging that the NYSPSC’s approval of the DNG Agreement Term Sheet impermissibly interfered with FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction over the wholesale markets. Entergy moved to withdraw the lawsuit, and on November 18, 2016, the U.S. District Court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice.

New York Clean Energy Standard and Zero Emission Credit Nuclear Bailout — On August 1, 2016, the NYSPSC issued its Clean Energy Standard, or CES, order.  The CES order included three main components: (i) a commitment to move New York to 50% renewables by 2030; (ii) new renewable energy credit pricing for both new and existing renewable facilities; and (iii) a ZEC that would provide more than $7.6 billion over 12 years in out-of-market subsidy payments to certain selected nuclear generating units in the state. The stated purpose of the ZECs is to keep nuclear units running even though they would be uneconomic and likely retire if they received compensation only from the FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power market. The ZECs would have the effect of suppressing wholesale market prices and interfere with the wholesale market.  On October 19, 2016, NRG, along with other entities, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the validity of the NYSPSC action and the ZEC program. On December 9, 2016, Exelon, the NYSPSC and other parties filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On January 6, 2017, NRG, along with other parties, filed an opposition to the motions to dismiss. The motions are pending before the U.S. District Court.
Independent Power Producers of New York (IPPNY) Complaint — On January 9, 2017, EPSA requested FERC to promptly direct the NYISO to file tariff provisions to address pending market concerns related to out of market payments to existing generation in the NYISO. This request was prompted by the ZEC program initiated by the NYSPSC. This request follows IPPNY’s complaint at FERC against the NYISO on May 10, 2013, as amended on March 25, 2014. The generators asked FERC to direct the NYISO to require that capacity from existing generation resources that would have exited the market but for out-of-market payments. Failure to implement buyer-side mitigation measures could result in uneconomic entry, which artificially decreases capacity prices below competitive market levels.
New York Public Service Commission Retail Energy Market Proceedings — On February 23, 2016, the NYSPSC issued what it refers to as its “Retail Reset” order, or Reset Order, in docket 12-M-0476 et al.  Among other things, the Reset Order instituted a price cap on energy supply offers and required many retail providers to seek affirmative consent from certain retail customers over a very short period of time to retain those customers.  Retail suppliers who cannot meet these conditions will be required to return their customers to energy supply service provided by the local utility. On July 25, 2016, the New York Supreme Court vacated part of the Reset Order on procedural grounds and remanded the matter to the NYSPSC for further consideration. Additionally, the Court affirmed the NYSPSC’s authority to regulate Energy Service Companies prices.  The matter is now on appeal before the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division. On December 2, 2016 in the same docket, the NYSPSC issued notice of an evidentiary proceeding and collaborative process to determine the future structure of the retail energy market in New York.  The outcome of this evidentiary and collaborative process, combined with the outcome of the appeal of the Reset Order, could affect the viability of the New York retail energy market. 
Gulf Coast Region 
ERCOT 
Greens Bayou Unit 5 RMR Status — On March 29, 2016, NRG filed notice with ERCOT of its intent to mothball Greens Bayou Unit 5. On May 27, 2016, ERCOT made a final determination that the unit is needed for reliability must-run, or RMR, service to address potential operational contingencies. On June 14, 2016, the ERCOT Board confirmed ERCOT’s determination and approved a two-year RMR agreement, effective June 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018; provided, however, ERCOT may terminate the RMR agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice. ERCOT has a standard form contract that provides for recovery of the operating costs of the unit, together with additional performance metrics and incentives. The estimated budget for the unit is $58 million for the contract period, which amount does not include any incentives.  Under the RMR agreement, the unit is only available to ERCOT during the months of June through September.  On July 13, 2016, ERCOT issued a request for proposals for alternatives to the RMR agreement. No alternatives were selected by ERCOT. As a result of rule changes, ERCOT determined that the RMR agreement is only needed until a new 1,100 MW combined cycle plant at Colorado Bend Generating Station comes on line, expected in mid-2017. 
MISO
Revisions to MISO Capacity Construct — On November 20, 2015, FERC issued a final order denying NRG’s request for rehearing of a 2012 FERC order approving the MISO capacity construct. NRG filed a petition for review of FERC’s decision with the D.C. Circuit on the grounds that FERC’s order denies merchant generators in MISO’s footprint any reasonable opportunity to recover their fixed costs. On November 2, 2016, NRG filed its initial brief and briefing continues. The eventual outcome of this proceeding could impact MISO’s attempts to redesign its capacity markets and thereby affect the value of NRG’s uncontracted assets within the MISO footprint.

MISO Forward Capacity Market Design for Retail Choice States— MISO staff has proposed revisions to its market design by implementing a three-year Forward Resource Auction for Illinois and the portion of Michigan with Retail Choice Load with a Sloped Demand Curve.  On November 1, 2016, MISO filed its proposal with FERC. On December 14, 2016, NRG filed a protest to MISO’s proposal.  On February 2, 2017, FERC rejected MISO’s proposal.  
West Region
CAISO
Carlsbad Energy Center — On May 21, 2015, the CPUC approved the Carlsbad Energy Center PPTA for a nominally rated 500 MW five unit natural gas peaking plant. On December 7, 2015, three parties filed two petitions for a writ of review with the California Court of Appeal appealing the CPUC's decision. On November 30, 2016, the California Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the CPUC's approval of the PPTA. The period in which to seek review of that decision in the California Supreme Court has passed, and the CPUC’s decision is now final.
Puente Power Project — On May 26, 2016, the CPUC approved the resource adequacy purchase agreement, or RAPA, between SCE and NRG for the construction of the 262 MW natural gas peaking Puente Power Project. On July 1, 2016, four different parties sought rehearing of the CPUC's approval of the RAPA. On December 1, 2016, the CPUC affirmed approval of the RAPA in a rehearing decision. On January 4, 2017, a petition for writ of review was filed in the California Court of Appeal seeking to reverse the CPUC's approval of the RAPA.
 Environmental Matters 
NRG is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants. NRG is also subject to laws regarding the protection of wildlife, including migratory birds, eagles and threatened and endangered species. New requirements regarding GHGs, combustion byproducts, water discharge and use, and threatened and endangered species have been put in place in recent years. Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the Company's operations. Complying with environmental laws involves significant capital and operating expenses. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital.  
A number of regulations with the potential to affect the Company and its facilities are in development, under review or have been recently promulgated by the EPA, including ESPS/NSPS for GHGs, ash disposal requirements, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent guidelines. NRG is currently reviewing the outcome and any resulting impact of recently promulgated regulations and cannot fully predict such impact until legal challenges are resolved and the new presidential administration decides how to proceed with some of the more controversial regulations. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time, although this trend could change in the near term with respect to federal laws under the new U.S. presidential administration.
Air
The CAA and the resulting regulations (as well as similar state and local requirements) have the potential to affect air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO2, ozone, and PM2.5. Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the EPA as not achieving certain NAAQS (non-attainment areas). The relevant NAAQS have historically become more stringent. The Company maintains a comprehensive compliance strategy to address continuing and new requirements. Complying with increasingly stringent NAAQS could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some NRG facilities or retiring of units if installing such controls is not economical. Significant changes to air regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below. 
Ozone NAAQS — On October 26, 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule that reduces the ozone NAAQS to 0.070 ppm. If it survives legal challenges, this more stringent NAAQS will obligate the states to develop plans to reduce NOx (an ozone precursor), which could affect some of the Company's units. 
29


Cross-State Air Pollution Rule — The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain states' obligations to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards. In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards. Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the court ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO2 budgets for four states including Texas and (ii) ozone-season NOx budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update Rule, which reduces future NOx allocations and discounts the current banked allowances to account for the more stringent 2008 Ozone NAAQS and to address the D.C. Circuit's July 2015 decision. This rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. The Company believes its investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance.
MATS — In February 2012, the EPA promulgated standards (the MATS rule) to control emissions of HAPs from coal and oil-fired electric generating units. The rule established limits for mercury, non-mercury metals, certain organics and acid gases, which had to be met beginning in April 2015 (with some units getting a 1-year extension). In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of Michigan v. EPA, and held that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emitted by electric generating units. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the MATS rule but rather remanded it to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the MATS rule to the EPA without vacatur. On April 25, 2016, the EPA released a supplemental finding that the benefits of this regulation outweigh the costs to address the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the EPA had not properly considered costs. This finding has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. While NRG cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, NRG believes that because it has already invested in pollution controls and cleaner technologies, the fleet is well-positioned to comply with the MATS rule.
Clean Power Plan — The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal regulations and state legislative and regulatory action. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. The D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, heard oral argument on the legal challenges to the CPP in September 2016. Due to the ongoing litigation and the potential impact of the new U.S. presidential administration, the Company believes the CPP is not likely to survive. 
30


CO2 Emissions — NRG emits CO2 when generating electricity at most of its facilities. The graphs presented below illustrate NRG's U.S. Scope 1 emissions of CO2e for 2014, 2015 and 2016. The percentage of Scope 1 emissions covered under emissions-limiting regulations is 18% and the percentage of Scope 1 emissions covered under emission-reporting regulations is 82%. NRG anticipates reductions in its future emissions profile as the Company modernizes the fleet through repowering, improves generation efficiencies, and explores methods to capture CO2. From 2015 to 2016, the Company's CO2e emissions decreased from 86 million metric tons to approximately 66 million metric tons, representing a 19% reduction year over year. Factors leading to the decreased emissions include reductions in fleetwide annual net generation due to an overall decrease in market demand and a market-driven shift towards increased generation from natural gas over coal. The Company's goal is to reduce its total U.S. Scope 1, 2 and 3 CO2e emissions by 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050, using 2014 as a baseline. 
The effects from federal, regional or state regulation of GHGs on the Company's financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including the outcome of the legal challenges, regulatory design, level of GHG reductions, the availability of offsets, actions of the new U.S. presidential administration, and the extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive CO2 emissions credits without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market. Thereafter, under any such legislation or regulation, the impact on NRG would depend on the Company's level of success in developing and deploying low and no carbon technologies.
 Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination
In April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. The Company has evaluated the impact of the new rule on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and has accrued its environmental and asset retirement obligations under the rule based on current estimates as of December 31, 2016.

Domestic Site Remediation Matters
Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of any facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the facility. NRG may be responsible for property damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, or SARA, impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations. Further discussions of affected NRG sites can be found in Item 15 — Note 24, Environmental Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Nuclear Waste — The federal government's program to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was discontinued in 2010. Since 1998, the U.S. DOE has been in default of the federal government's obligations to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel, or SNF, and high-level radioactive waste, or HLW, under the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, or the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Owners of nuclear plants, including the owners of STP, had been required to enter into contracts setting out the obligations of the owners and the U.S. DOE, including the fees to be paid by the owners for the U.S. DOE's services to license a spent fuel repository. Effective May 16, 2014, the U.S. DOE stopped collecting the fees. 
On February 5, 2013, STPNOC entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOE for payment of damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act through December 31, 2013, which was extended through an addendum dated January 24, 2014, to December 31, 2016. On December 12, 2016, STPNOC received the federal government's offer of another three-year extension of payment for continued failure to accept SNF and HLW. The proposal has been reviewed for adequacy and, with advice of counsel, was accepted. There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the U.S., nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. STPNOC currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities in on-site storage pools.  Since STPNOC's SNF storage pools do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the units, STPNOC is proceeding to construct dry cask storage capability on-site. STPNOC plans to continue to assert claims against the U.S. DOE for damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW.
Under the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended, the state of Texas is required to provide, either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within the state. STP's warehouse capacity is adequate for on-site storage until a site in Andrews County, Texas becomes fully operational. 
Water
Clean Water Act — The Company is required under the CWA to comply with intake and discharge requirements, requirements for technological controls and operating practices. As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements. 
Once Through Cooling Regulation — In August 2014, EPA finalized the regulation regarding the use of water for once through cooling at existing facilities to address impingement and entrainment concerns. NRG anticipates that more stringent requirements will be incorporated into some of its water discharge permits over the next several years as NPDES permits are renewed.
Effluent Limitations Guidelines — In November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which will impose more stringent requirements (as individual permits are renewed) for wastewater streams from flue gas desulfurization, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. The Company estimates that it would cost approximately $200 million over the next eight years (the majority of the cost would be incurred after 2019) to comply with this rule at 11 coal-fired plants. This regulation has been challenged and is subject to legal uncertainty. The change in U.S. presidential administration increases the likelihood that the legal challenges will succeed. The Company decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on: the certainty of regulations; evaluation of different technologies; options to convert to gas; and the expected economic returns on the capital. Over the next several years, the Company will decide whether to proceed with these investments at each of the plants as permits are renewed based on, among other things, the legal certainty of the regulation and market conditions at that time.

Regional Environmental Developments
East Region
New Source Review — The EPA and various states have been investigating compliance of electric generating facilities with the pre-construction permitting requirements of the CAA known as “new source review,” or NSR. In 2007, Midwest Generation received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Crawford, Fisk, Joliet, Powerton, Waukegan and Will County generating stations violated NSR and other regulations. These alleged violations are the subject of litigation described in Item 15 — Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies. In January 2009, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Keystone, Portland and Shawville generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR. In June 2011, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Avon Lake and Niles generating stations violated NSR. In December 2007, the NJDEP filed suit alleging that NSR violations occurred at the Portland generating station, which suit was resolved pursuant to a July 2013 Consent Decree. Additionally, in April 2013, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued four NOVs alleging that past work at oil-fired combustion turbines at the Torrington Terminal, Franklin, Branford and Middletown generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR. 
Burton Island Old Ash Landfill — In January 2006, NRG's Indian River Power LLC was notified that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to Burton Island Old Ash Landfill, a historic captive landfill located at the Indian River facility. On October 1, 2007, NRG signed an agreement with DNREC to investigate the site through the Voluntary Clean-up Program, or the VCP. On February 4, 2008, DNREC issued findings that no further action was required in relation to surface water and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project would satisfactorily address shoreline erosion. The landfill itself required a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the type and scope of any additional required work. DNREC approved the Feasibility Study in December 2012. In January 2013, DNREC proposed a remediation plan based on the Feasibility Study. The remediation plan was approved in October 2013. In December 2015, DNREC approved the Company's remediation design and the Company's Long Term Stewardship Plan. The cost of completing the work required by the approved remediation plan is consistent with amounts budgeted in early 2016 and on track for completion in 2017. The estimated cost to comply with the Long-Term Stewardship Plan was added to the liability in December 2016. 
In addition to the VCP, on May 29, 2008, DNREC requested that NRG's Indian River Power LLC participate in the development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill. NRG is currently working with DNREC and other trustees to close out the assessment process. 
RGGI — The Company operates generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York that are subject to RGGI, which is a regional cap and trade system. In 2013, each of these states finalized a rule that reduced and will continue to reduce the number of allowances through 2020. The nine RGGI states are re-evaluating the program and may alter the rules to further reduce the number of allowances. The revisions being currently contemplated could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
Massachusetts Global Warming Solutions Act Proposed Regulation — In May 2016, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that Massachusetts DEP had not complied with the 2008 Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires establishing limits for sources of GHGs. The Court held that participation in RGGI was not sufficient. In December 2016, the Massachusetts DEP proposed a regulation that would limit GHG emissions from large electric generating facilities located in Massachusetts.  A final regulation is expected by August 2017.  If promulgated in its current form, the regulation may limit the operations of affected facilities.
Gulf Coast Region
Texas Regional Haze — In January 2016, the EPA promulgated a final rule that requires 15 coal-fired units (at eight plants in Texas) to reduce their SO2 rates at various times over the next five years if the rule survives legal challenges.  This Regional Haze rule was promulgated under the portion of the CAA that seeks to improve visibility at national parks. Eight of these 15 units already have scrubbers and seven do not.  NRG owns two of the affected units, Limestone units 1 and 2, which already have scrubbers.  The rule requires that the Limestone units reduce their SO2 emission rates by 2019.  In July 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the rule pending resolution of the legal challenges. On December 2, 2016, the EPA filed a motion in the Fifth Circuit for partial voluntary remand and partial lifting of the stay, but did not request vacatur of the final rule.

 Illinois Union Insurance Company Litigation — On October 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana issued an order granting LaGen’s motion for summary judgment on its claims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract against ILU for its failure to indemnify LaGen for the costs LaGen paid pursuant to the consent decree that resolved the NSR lawsuit which was brought by the U.S. EPA and LA DEQ against LaGen related to Big Cajun II. The court entered judgment in favor of LaGen for approximately $27 million. In addition, the court ruled that LaGen is entitled to approximately $7 million for future consent decree costs as they are incurred. On October 14, 2015, ILU filed a motion to stay execution of the judgment, which was granted on October 19, 2015. Also, on October 14, 2015, ILU filed a notice to appeal the judgment. On January 14, 2016, the U.S. District Court granted LaGen's motion for attorney's fees of approximately $2 million for the indemnity phase of the litigation. On January 29, 2016, ILU filed an appeal brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Court of Appeals issued a decision on August 4, 2016 which vacated the summary judgment ruling and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court. The remanded case has been set for trial on May 8, 2017.
