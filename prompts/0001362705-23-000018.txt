Item 1. Business
The following section generally provides disclosure regarding business developments during the year ended December 31, 2022. Discussion of prior period business developments that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part I, Item 1. Business” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2022.
Overview
We are a publicly-traded limited partnership formed in 2005 focused on the acquisition, development, and ownership of infrastructure critical to the transition of energy supply to lower carbon sources. We own natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, and processing facilities in South Texas and continue to pursue energy transition infrastructure opportunities. We are managed by our general partner, which is owned by a subsidiary of Stonepeak Catarina. Our common units are currently listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “SNMP.”
Business Developments during the Year Ended December 31, 2022
2022 Settlement Agreement
On May 27, 2022, SN Catarina, LLC (“SN Catarina”), Catarina Midstream, LLC (“Catarina Midstream”), Mesquite, the Partnership, our general partner, SP Holdings, and SN Operating LLC (“SN Operating,” collectively, with SN Catarina, Catarina Midstream, Mesquite, the Partnership, our general partner, and SP Holdings, the “Settlement Parties”) entered into the 2022 Settlement Agreement in order to resolve the various claims, defenses, causes of action, and other disputes between and among the Settlement Parties, including with respect to (i) the non-administered arbitration initiated by Catarina Midstream on August 30, 2021 against SN Catarina pursuant to the International Institute for Conflict Prevention & Resolution Non-Administered Arbitration Rules (the “Catarina Arbitration”), and (ii) adversary proceeding 21-03931 (MI) initiated by Mesquite and SN Catarina on October 15, 2021 (“collectively, the “Mesquite Plaintiffs”) against the Partnership and Catarina Midstream in the Bankruptcy Court (the “Mesquite Adversary”). 
In the Catarina Arbitration, Catarina Midstream asserted claims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract arising from SN Catarina’s failure to pay increased tariff rates for interruptible throughput volumes from Eastern Catarina and its refusal to pay the incremental infrastructure fee since July 2021. Catarina Midstream also sought its attorneys’ fees, costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest from SN Catarina. SN Catarina filed a counterclaim against Catarina Midstream alleging Catarina Midstream’s June 24, 2021 tariff rate increase, and its two prior tariff rate increases under the Gathering Agreement, constituted breaches of contract. SN Catarina also alleged that Catarina Midstream’s continued addition of the incremental infrastructure fee on a month-to-month basis after March 31, 2018 constituted an additional breach of the Gathering Agreement. SN Catarina sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
In the Mesquite Adversary, the Mesquite Plaintiffs sought recharacterization of the Catarina Transaction (as defined below under “—Midstream Business— Catarina Gathering System”) as a disguised financing and claimed that SN Catarina was the legal owner of the Catarina Gathering System (as defined below under “—Midstream Business— Catarina Gathering System”) and demanded its return. The Mesquite Plaintiffs also asserted various claims for constructive and actual fraudulent transfer arising from (1) the Catarina Transaction; (2) payments made by SN Catarina to Catarina Midstream under the Gathering Agreement after Catarina Midstream increased tariff rates for interruptible throughput volumes from the eastern portion (“Eastern Catarina”) of Mesquite’s acreage position in Dimmit, La Salle and Webb counties in Texas; and (3) payments made by SN Catarina to Catarina Midstream for the incremental infrastructure fee under the Gathering Agreement amendment and on a month-to-month basis by mutual agreement of the parties after the amendment’s expiration. The Mesquite Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief related to the recharacterization claim as well as avoidance of the alleged constructive and actual fraudulent transfers and recovery of the amounts transferred to Catarina Midstream.
Pursuant to the 2022 Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Parties agreed, among other things, to the following actions and agreements effective as of May 27, 2022: (i) to promptly and diligently seek a stay of all deadlines and proceedings in both the Catarina Arbitration and the Mesquite Adversary, in each case, pending the effectiveness of releases to be executed by each Settlement Party and delivered to each other Settlement Party within five (5) days after the 
effective date of the Approval Order, such releases including customary releases providing for, among other things, the release of any and all actions, causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, reckonings, contracts, damages, judgments, claims, and demands whatsoever, in law or equity, known or unknown, asserted or unasserted, including, but not limited to claims that were or could have been asserted through May 27, 2022, in each case with respect to the accounts receivable attributable to the Tariff Short-Pay or otherwise in connection with the Catarina Arbitration or the Mesquite Adversary (the “Releases”), (ii) that the Tolling Period (as defined in the 2022 Settlement Agreement) shall not be included in computing any statute of limitations or statute of repose for any claim or cause of action subject to the Releases (the “Tolled Claims”), nor will the Tolling Period be considered in support of other listed defenses in the 2022 Settlement Agreement, including lawsuits or actions involving Tolled Claims, and (iii) concurrently with the execution of the 2022 Settlement Agreement, SN Catarina and SN Operating filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion pursuant to Rule 9019 of the Bankruptcy Rules (the “9019 Motion”) seeking the approval (the “Approval Order”) of the 2022 Settlement Agreement, including the Releases included therein, on an expedited basis. The Bankruptcy Court granted the 9019 Motion and issued of the Approval Order on June 7, 2022, and the Approval Order became final and non-appealable on June 21, 2022. 
On June 23, 2022, in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Settlement Agreement, (i) Mesquite paid $10 million to the Partnership, (ii) each of the Settlement Parties executed and delivered to each other Settlement Party the Releases, (iii) the Partnership and Mesquite executed and delivered to each other an assignment agreement, in the form attached as Exhibit B to the 2022 Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which the Partnership assigned to Mesquite any claims of the Partnership arising out of or related to the conduct alleged in Sanchez Oil & Gas Corp., et al. v. Terra Energy Partners LLC, et al., Cause No. 2016-18909 (Dist. Ct., Harris County, Texas, 11th Jud’l Dist.), and (iv) the Settlement Parties sign and submit stipulations of dismissal, or such other documents as may be required, to effectuate dismissal of the Catarina Arbitration and the Mesquite Adversary with prejudice.
Amended and Restated Firm Gathering and Processing Agreement
On the May 27, 2022, Catarina Midstream and SN Catarina entered into that certain Amended and Restated Firm Gathering and Processing Agreement (the “A&R Gathering Agreement”). The A&R Gathering Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Gathering Agreement. The A&R Gathering Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) a new dedication of Eastern Catarina, whereas only the western portion of such acreage (“Western Catarina”) was dedicated under the Gathering Agreement, (ii) different established gathering and processing fee rates for existing production on Western Catarina or Eastern Catarina consistent with rates charged and paid until June 2021 as well as new rates for new production from the Dedicated Acreage (as defined in the A&R Gathering Agreement) or from the Subject Wells (as defined in the A&R Gathering Agreement), and (iii) new obligations with respect to pressure limitations at certain measurement points attributable to SN Catarina or Catarina Midstream and with respect to FL&U (as defined in the A&R Gathering Agreement). The A&R Gathering Agreement provided to the Partnership the payment of amounts equaling approximately $5 million from Mesquite. The extension of the Partnership’s previous firm gathering and processing agreement with Mesquite and provision of a separate rate for new production in Mesquite’s Catarina acreage solidifies the Partnership’s commercial position regarding its current gathering and processing operations with Mesquite.
Gathering Agreement Side Letter
On May 27, 2022, concurrently with the execution of the A&R Gathering Agreement, Catarina Midstream and SN Catarina also entered into a side letter agreement (the “Gathering Agreement Side Letter”), pursuant to which SN Catarina agreed to (i) seek dismissal with prejudice of the proceeding initiated by SN Catarina and SN Operating, LLC with the Texas Railroad Commission on February 18, 2022, (ii) make a one-time payment to Catarina Midstream of $4,443,248, and (iii) pay an amount equal to $687,333 representing the difference between the amount paid by SN Catarina for services for the month of April 2022 and the amount that is due under the terms of the A&R Gathering Agreement.
Kodiak Sale
On each of March 11, 2022, and May 9, 2022, we entered into a purchase and sale agreements with Kodiak Gas Services, LLC, pursuant to which we sold to Kodiak natural gas compression equipment, which resulted in certain owned 
equipment being replaced with equipment leased from Kodiak (the “Kodiak Sale”). The Kodiak Sale followed our entrance into a gas compression agreement with Kodiak on November 9, 2021 (the “Kodiak Compression Agreement”).
Subsequent Events
Termination of Chief Executive Officer and Director and Chief Operating Officer
Effective March 15, 2023, the Board terminated Randall Gibbs, the Chief Executive Officer of our general partner, and Michael Keuss, the President and Chief Operating Officer of our general partner. The terminations of Messrs. Gibbs and Keuss were each without “Cause,” as such term is defined in each of the Executive Services Agreements, each dated November 3, 2021, between our general partner and each of Messrs. Gibbs and Keuss, respectively. SP Holdings, the sole member of our general partner, also removed Mr. Gibbs from his position on the Board effective as of March 15, 2023. The removal of Mr. Gibbs from his position on the Board was not the result of any disagreement with the Partnership, the Board or our general partner.
Appointment of Interim Chief Executive Officer
On March 15, 2023, the Board appointed Charles C. Ward, the current Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of our general partner, to serve as the Interim Chief Executive Officer of our general partner, in addition to continuing as Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Mr. Ward’s appointment as Interim Chief Executive Officer was effective on the March 15, 2023. As a result of Mr. Ward’s appointment as Interim Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ward will be designated as both our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer.
Amended Executive Agreement
In connection with Mr. Ward’s appointment as the Interim Chief Executive Officer of our general partner, our general partner and Mr. Ward entered into that certain Second Amended and Restated Executive Services Agreement, effective as of March 15, 2023 (the “Amended Executive Agreement”), which was approved by the Board on March 10, 2023 and amends and restates the Amended and Restated Executive Services Agreement, between Mr. Ward and our general partner, dated as of September 2, 2022 (the “Ward Executive Agreement”).
The Amended Executive Agreement, among other things, provides for Mr. Ward’s appointment as the Interim Chief Executive Officer of our general partner on a temporary basis and amends the definition of “Good Reason” to establish that “Good Reason” will not include (whether pursuant to the Ward Executive Agreement or the Amended Executive Agreement) Mr. Ward’s appointment to the position of Interim Chief Executive Officer, or the replacement of Mr. Ward as Interim Chief Executive Officer with a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer; provided that Mr. Ward continues to serve as the Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of our general partner following the appointment of a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer.
First Amendment to Framework Agreement
On February 17, 2023, we and HOBO entered into the First Amendment to the Framework Agreement (the “Framework Amendment”). The Framework Amendment, among other things, (i) provides that the Partnership will pay the Initial Development Fee (as defined in the Framework Agreement) if the Partnership is in its sole discretion satisfied and elects to proceed with the Initial Project (as defined in the Framework Agreement); (ii) amended the termination provisions to provide for immediate termination following notice by either the Partnership or HOBO from and after June 1, 2023; (iii) removed the exclusivity period; and (iv) removed certain HOBO information reporting requirements.
Stonepeak Election
On February 10, 2023, the Partnership received written notice of Stonepeak’s election to receive distributions on the Class C Preferred Units for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 in Class C Preferred PIK Units. The aggregate distribution of 1,276,605 Class C Preferred PIK Units was paid on February 28, 2023 to holders of record on February 20, 2023.
Our Relationship with Stonepeak
Since October 14, 2015, Stonepeak Catarina has owned all of our issued and outstanding preferred units. As of March 24, 2023, Stonepeak owns (i) 200,202,635 common units, representing approximately 78.5% of our total 254,893,417 outstanding common units (the common unit amounts include 23,861,365 common units Stonepeak Catarina has the right to acquire upon exercise of the Stonepeak Warrant), (ii) all of our issued and outstanding Class C Preferred Units, (iii) the Stonepeak Warrant, which entitles Stonepeak Catarina to receive junior securities of the Partnership (including common units) representing 10% of all junior securities deemed outstanding when exercised, (iv) the non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership and (v) all of our incentive distribution rights. Stonepeak also owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests in SP Holdings, which is the sole member of our general partner. SP Holdings has the right to appoint all of the members of the Board of directors other than two directors which Stonepeak Catarina is entitled to designate pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Board Representation and Standstill Agreement, dated as of August 2, 2019. As a result of the foregoing, Stonepeak controls us and our general partner and has the ability to appoint all of the members of the Board.
Pursuant to Section 15.1 of our partnership agreement, if at any time Stonepeak holds more than 80% of our outstanding common units and transfers all of the common units held by it to our general partner or a controlled affiliate of our general partner (the “Stonepeak LCR Transfer”), Stonepeak will be able to cause our general partner or a controlled affiliate of our general partner to exercise its right to acquire all, but not less than all, of our common units held by persons other than our general partner and its controlled affiliates (the “limited call right”). During the period from December 28, 2022 to March 15, 2023, Stonepeak held more than 80% of our outstanding common units. As of the date of this Form 10-K Stonepeak holds approximately 76.3% of our common units. If Stonepeak holds more than 80% of our common units at any point following the date of this Form 10-K, Stonepeak will be able to cause our general partner to exercise the limited call right at any time after Stonepeak completes the Stonepeak LCR Transfer by causing our general partner to exercise its limited call right at a price equal to the greater of (1) the average of the daily closing price of our common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three days before notice of exercise of our general partner’s limited call right is first mailed and (2) the highest per-unit price paid by our general partner or any of its controlled affiliates for common units during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, common unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Common unitholders may also incur tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our general partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of common units to be repurchased upon exercise of its limited call right. If our general partner exercises its limited call right, the effect would be to take the Partnership private and, if the common units are subsequently deregistered, the Partnership will no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.
Stonepeak Catarina is indirectly managed by Stonepeak Partners LP, a leading North American infrastructure private equity firm (“Stonepeak Partners”). Stonepeak Partners’ significant infrastructure and midstream energy expertise and deep financial resources are reflected in over $53 billion of assets under management, with investments to date including, among others, preferred and common interests in the Partnership, MPLX LP and Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. We believe that, as a result of Stonepeak’s significant ownership interest in us, Stonepeak is incentivized to support and promote our business plan and to encourage us to pursue projects that enhance the overall value of our business. While our relationship with Stonepeak is a significant strength, it is also a source of potential risks and conflicts. Please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in an Investment in Our Common Units” and “Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
Business Strategy
Our primary business objective is to create long-term value by generating stable and predictable cash flows that allow us to reduce the amount of our indebtedness and pursue energy transition infrastructure opportunities. We plan to achieve this objective by executing the following business strategy:
•grow our business through the acquisition and development of infrastructure critical to the transition of energy supply to lower carbon sources;
•pursue organic investments in our existing operating areas to support growth; 
•pursue strategic relationships with third-party producers and other companies with operations in the area in which we operate in order to maximize the utilization of our midstream facilities or provide other revenue-generating services; and
•maintain financial flexibility and a strong capital structure.
Midstream Business
Our midstream business primarily consists of the following assets described below: the Catarina Gathering System, the Carnero Gathering Line and the Raptor Plant owned by the Carnero JV and the Seco Pipeline. All of our midstream assets are located in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas.
Catarina Gathering System
Our primary asset is a gathering system (the “Catarina Gathering System”), which is located on the western portion of Mesquite’s acreage position in Dimmit, La Salle and Webb counties in Texas (such net acreage is collectively referred to herein as “Mesquite’s Catarina Asset,” and the western portion of such net acreage is individually referred to herein as “Western Catarina”). The Catarina Gathering System consists of approximately 160 miles of gathering pipelines, four main processing and gathering facilities, including stabilizers, storage tanks, dehydration units, and other related assets in Western Catarina, which are located in Dimmit and Webb counties in Texas, and services upstream production from Mesquite’s Catarina Asset. We lease gas compression units from Kodiak pursuant to the Kodiak Compression Agreement. The gathering lines range in diameter from four to twelve inches, with a capacity of 200 MMcf/d for natural gas, and 40 MBbl/d for crude oil and NGLs. There are four main gathering and processing facilities, which includes eight stabilizers of 5,000 Bbls/d, approximately 25,000 Bbls of storage capacity, pressurized storage for NGLs, approximately 15,000 horsepower of compression and approximately 300 MMcf/d of dehydration capacity. The average age of the Catarina Gathering System assets is approximately ten years, and such assets have an average expected life of approximately 19 additional years. The Catarina Gathering System is currently used solely to support the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil produced by Mesquite from Mesquite’s Catarina Asset, for which Mesquite pays us gathering and processing fees pursuant to the Gathering Agreement. The Catarina Gathering System has oil interconnects with the Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. header system delivered to the Gardendale terminal, and to all four takeaway pipelines to Corpus Christi, and natural gas interconnects with Kinder Morgan Inc., Energy Transfer Operating, L.P. and Targa Resources Corp.
During the year ended December 31, 2022 Mesquite transported average daily production through the Catarina Gathering System of approximately 4.5 MBbls/d of oil, 63.5 MMcf/d of natural gas and 0.5 MBbls/d of water.
Carnero JV
We own a 50% equity interest in Carnero G&P LLC (“Carnero JV”), which is our joint venture with Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) (“Targa”). Carnero JV owns and Targa operates the following assets: (i) the 200 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant located in Bee County, Texas (“Silver Oak II Plant”), (ii) the 260 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant located in La Salle County, Texas (the “Raptor Plant”), and (iii) 45 miles of high pressure natural gas gathering pipelines with a design limited (without compression) of 400 MMcf/d (the “Carnero Gathering Line”) which connect the Catarina Gathering System to nearby pipelines and the Raptor Plant. Mesquite and its working interest partners dedicated over 315,000 acres located in the Western Eagle Ford on Mesquite’s acreage in Dimmit, Webb, La Salle, Zavala and Maverick counties in Texas (such acreage is collectively referred to herein as “Mesquite’s Comanche Asset”) to the Carnero JV pursuant to a long-term firm gas gathering and processing agreement.
Seco Pipeline
We own and operate a 30-mile natural gas pipeline with a 400 MMcf/d capacity that is designed and used to transport dry gas from the Raptor Plant to multiple markets in South Texas (the “Seco Pipeline”). The Seco Pipeline has an expected life of approximately 40 years and provides upstream producers with optionality to southern gas markets and creates the potential to export natural gas to premium priced markets in Mexico. From September 1, 2017 to February 12, 2020, we utilized the Seco Pipeline to provide transportation services to Mesquite pursuant to a firm transportation service agreement (the “Seco Pipeline Transportation Agreement”). Mesquite terminated the Seco Pipeline Transportation Agreement on February 12, 2020 and, since such termination, we have not contracted with a customer for transportation on the Seco Pipeline or utilized the pipeline other than transportation of de minimis volumes required to comply with requirements under certain of our rights-of-way. Our management team is actively pursuing new opportunities to contract with new customers or find other utilizations for the Seco Pipeline.
Title to Properties
Title to the Catarina Gathering System and the Seco Pipeline assets are either owned in fee or derived from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license that is held by us or to the title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease we own, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of the material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses with respect to all Catarina Gathering System and Seco Pipeline assets.
Marketing and Major Customers
Mesquite accounted for 100% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. We are highly dependent upon Mesquite as our most significant customer, and we expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from Mesquite for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Mesquite. Any development that materially and adversely affects Mesquite’s operations or financial condition could have a material adverse impact on us. For additional information on the risks associated with our reliance on Mesquite, please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Markets and Competition
We operate in a competitive environment for acquiring, funding and developing infrastructure assets and properties and retaining trained personnel. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than us. As a result, our competitors may be able to outbid us for assets or properties, more competitively price their gathering and transportation services, or utilize superior technical resources than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional assets will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable assets and to consummate transactions in a competitive environment.
The natural gas gathering, compression, treating and transportation business is very competitive. Upon such time that we seek to obtain customers in addition to Mesquite for the Catarina Gathering System, our competitors will include other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies.
Stonepeak is not restricted from competing with us. Please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Stonepeak Catarina and its affiliates, including our general partner, will have conflicts of interest with us. They will not owe any fiduciary duties to us or our common unitholders, but instead will owe us and our common unitholders limited contractual duties, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our other common unitholders.” Additional information regarding our relationship with Stonepeak is provided in “Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
Governmental Regulation
Environmental Laws
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
•require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
•restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances, including water and waste, that can be released into the environment;
•limit or prohibit activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and
•require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.
These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible in the absence of such regulations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. In addition, federal, state and local authorities frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
Environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on the oil and natural gas industry and our operations include the following:
Waste Handling
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes and non-hazardous wastes. With the approval of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluid, produced water and most other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. Although we do not believe that the current costs of managing any of our wastes are material under presently applicable laws, any future reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes, could increase our costs to manage and dispose of wastes.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons can include the owners or operators of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, including response costs, alternative water supplies, damages to natural resources and the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Each state also has environmental cleanup laws analogous to CERCLA.
We currently own, lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas production for a number of years. Although we believe that operating and waste disposal practices utilized in the past with respect to these properties were typical for the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose practices, including the treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future environmental harm.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”), and comparable state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and natural gas wastes, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, impose investigatory or remedial obligations and issue injunctions limiting or preventing our operations for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
Oil Pollution Act
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amended the Clean Water Act in large part due to the Exxon Valdez incident. Under the Oil Pollution Act, the EPA was directed to promulgate regulations which would create a comprehensive prevention, response, liability and compensation program to deal with oil discharged into United States navigable waters. The Oil Pollution Act imposes ongoing requirements on owners and operators of facilities that handle certain quantities of crude oil, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with a spill. The Oil Pollution Act imposes liability for removal costs and damages resulting from an incident in which oil is discharged into navigable waters and establishes liability for damages for injuries to, or loss of, natural resources.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. States can also impose air emissions limitations that are more stringent than the federal standards imposed by the EPA. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Rules restricting air emissions may require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our operating results. However, we believe that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by any such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with federal and state air emission standards.
Climate Change 
The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. The EPA is considering rulemaking proposals in accordance with Executive Order 13990 Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis (“E.O. 13990”) which was signed by President Biden in January 2021 seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise or rescind prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. In November 2021, EPA proposed rules to reduce methane and other air pollutants from both new and existing sources in the oil and gas industry. A number of state and regional efforts have also emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to possess and acquire emission allowances which permit corresponding GHG emissions. Furthermore, the U.S. is currently a party to the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 to reduce global GHG emissions. 
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices and has finalized a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, finding that under certain circumstances, the “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources. In 2014, the EPA released an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on its plans to issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 to require companies to disclose information regarding chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The states in which we operate have also adopted disclosure requirements related to fracturing fluids. Legislation has been introduced, but not adopted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Currently, no states in which we utilize hydraulic fracturing have adopted these regulations. In addition, President Biden has declared that he would support federal government efforts to limit or prohibit hydraulic fracturing. These declarations include threats to take actions banning hydraulic fracturing of crude oil and natural gas wells and banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days. In addition, E.O. 13990 includes provisions seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change 
and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. Among the areas that could be affected by the review are regulations addressing hydraulic fracturing. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how these recent actions and future rules and rulemaking initiatives under the Biden administration will impact our business.
Endangered Species
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions and may materially delay or prohibit land access for development. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the FWS was required to make a determination on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our activities.
Gathering System Regulation
Regulation of gathering facilities may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation, gathering, and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and by FERC regulations. 
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of substantial litigation and varying interpretations. In addition, the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our natural gas gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts, or the U.S. Congress. If the FERC were to determine that an individual gathering system is not exempt from FERC regulation and the pipelines associated with such gathering system provide interstate transportation, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such gathering system would be subject to regulation by the FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. If any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the cost-based rate established by the FERC. 
Gathering services, which may occur upstream of transmission service subject to FERC jurisdiction, are regulated by the states. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Our purchasing and gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the State of Texas. The ratable take statute generally requires gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, the common purchaser statute generally requires gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport gas.
The Railroad Commission of Texas (“TRRC”) requires gatherers to file reports, obtain permits, make books and records available for audit and provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis. Shippers and producers may file complaints with the TRRC to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination.
While our gathering systems have not been regulated by the FERC under the NGA, the U.S. Congress may enact legislation or the FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas gatherers with which we compete. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by the FERC, and furthermore provides the FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EPAct 2005 provided the FERC with the power to assess increased daily civil penalties for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”), which currently are approximately $1.5 million per day per violation. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In Order No. 670, the FERC promulgated rules implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EPAct 2005. The rules make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to: (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. 
Pipeline Safety Regulation
Our natural gas and hazardous liquids pipelines are subject to the regulations of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), promulgated pursuant to the federal pipeline safety laws, 49 U.S.C. §§ 60101 et seq., and comparable state statutes. These regulations have been adopted and incorporated by reference by the Texas Railroad Commission (“TRRC”), which has assumed pipeline safety oversight authority for intrastate pipeline systems in Texas under an annual certification to PHMSA. TRRC has also adopted certain additional and/or more stringent safety standards applicable to intrastate pipeline systems in Texas.
PHMSA and TRRC regulations prescribe minimum safety standards for the design, installation, inspection, testing, construction, operation, replacement, and maintenance of pipeline facilities, including those used for the transportation of natural gas, crude oil and other petroleum products, including natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensate. Operators of regulated pipeline systems, including gathering lines, are required to comply with these safety standards, to permit access to and allow copying of records, and to make certain reports and provide information as required by the Secretary of Transportation and appropriate state authorities.
Among the pipeline safety standards adopted by TRRC and incorporated into the Texas pipeline safety program are PHMSA regulations that require gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs for certain pipelines, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to: 
•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; 
•identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact high consequence areas (HCAs); 
•improve data collection, integration and analysis; 
•repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and 
•implement preventive and mitigating actions. 
Furthermore, PHMSA regulations incorporate by reference the American Petroleum Institute Standard 653 (“API 653”) as the industry standard for the inspection, repair, alteration and reconstruction of storage tanks. API 653 requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of such tanks. These periodic tank maintenance requirements may result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our storage tanks.
Federal and state laws set forth potential fines and penalties for violations of applicable pipeline safety laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal and state pipeline safety laws and regulations. We also do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations (including federal regulations that are incorporated by reference). Our pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements. 
We have incorporated existing applicable requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs, based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and increases in the stringency of applicable pipeline safety regulations as outlined below (see “Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance”). In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity gathered on our system, or a regulatory inspection that identifies a deficiency in our required programs.
Other Laws and Regulation
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communications standard, OSHA Process Safety Management, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements.
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had no accrued environmental obligations. We are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures or that will otherwise have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, we cannot predict how future environmental laws and regulations may impact our operations, and therefore, cannot provide assurance that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital
Headcount
We do not have any employees. Pursuant to the terms of the Operational Services Agreement, our subsidiary SNMP Services provides us and certain of our subsidiaries, including SEP IV, Catarina Midstream and SECO Pipeline, LLC, with payroll, human resources, employee benefits and other consulting services we mutually agree upon with SNMP Services. As of March 24, 2023, twelve (12) employees were employed by SNMP Services with their primary function being to provide services for us, all of which were full-time employees. None of SNMP Services’ employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. When we refer to “our employees” in this Form 10-K we are referring the SNMP Services’ employees. Our success is due in large part to the skills, experience and dedication of such employees. 
Employee Safety
We believe our responsibility to our employees, neighbors, shareholders and the environment is only fulfilled through our commitment to safety and reliability. Through training, continuous monitoring and promoting a culture of excellence in operations, we continuously strive to keep our people, the communities in which we operate in and the environment safe. By monitoring the integrity of our assets and promoting the safety of our employees, we are investing in the long-term sustainability of our business. 
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
In response to COVID-19, we have taken steps to manage the potential impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our employees. We continue to practice remote work procedures when possible to protect the safety of our employees and their families, and have taken extra precautions for our employees who work in the field or cannot otherwise work remotely, such as social distancing, face covering protocols and sanitation procedures.
Development and Retention
In managing our human capital resources, we use a strategic approach to building a diverse, inclusive, and respectful workplace. SNMP Services provides expertise and tools to attract, develop, and retain diverse talent and support our employees’ career and development goals. We value our employees’ opinions and encourage them to engage with management and ask questions on topics such as our goals, challenges, and employee concerns. 
We believe that a combination of competitive compensation and career growth and development opportunities help increase employee morale and reduce voluntary turnover. Our comprehensive benefit packages are competitive in the marketplace and we believe in recognizing and rewarding talent through our various compensation programs.
Health and Welfare
We provide a variety of benefits to help promote the health and welfare of our employees and their families. These benefits include medical, dental, vision plans and virtual health visits. Eligible employees also have access, at no charge, to an employee assistance program.
