Item 1. Description of Business
Overview
 
We are a music technology company, that offers a suite of products and services that monetize and monitor music for artists, labels, performing rights organizations, publishers, writers, radio stations, venues, restaurants, bars, and other stakeholders in music.
 
VNUE, Inc., was incorporated as a Nevada corporation on April 4, 2006, under the name “ Buckingham Exploration Inc.”
 
On May 29, 2015, the Company, known at that time as Tierra Grande Resources Inc., acquired VNUE Washington or VNUE, resulting in VNUE becoming our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, and the holders of VNUE acquiring the majority of our outstanding capital stock. We also changed our name at that time to VNUE, Inc.
 
Covid-19 Pandemic
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. In addition to the devastating effects on human life, the pandemic is having a negative ripple effect on the global economy, leading to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets. Most U.S. states and many countries have issued policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease.
 
There are no comparable events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have. The onset of Covid-19 in March 2020 has had a material adverse impact on our business as described throughout this Report.
 
Overview of our Business
 
The live music and entertainment space are constantly searching for new monetization outlets. Music licensing and royalties are particular “hot button” issues in the industry. We believe that we have developed solutions that create new revenue streams, and simultaneously helps to protect the rights of the creators and will help ensure they are properly compensated. This benefits not only artists, labels, publishers, and live venues but the fans as well.
 
Through VNUE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, we now carry on business as a live entertainment music technology company that offers a suite of products and services which monetize and monitor music for artists, labels, performing rights organizations, publishers, writers, radio stations, venues, restaurants, bars, and other stakeholders in music. Our two main product lines are:
 

• | Set.fm™ / DiscLive Network™ - Our consumer app platform that allows fans to purchase the concert they just experienced instantly on their mobile device, and “instant” physical collectible products are recorded and sold at shows and online through the company’s exclusive partner DiscLive Network™, the 17+-year pioneer in “instant live” recording. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Soundstr™ - Our technology which is a comprehensive music identification and rights management Cloud platform that, when fully deployed, can accurately track and audit public performances of music, creating a more comprehensive and transparent ecosystem for general music licensing and associated royalty payments, and will help to ensure the correct stakeholders are paid through the use of our “big data” collection.



While Set.fm™ and Soundstr™ are proprietary marks of the Company, DiscLive, and its related marks and names are not owned by the Company and are owned or utilized by RockHouse Live Media Productions, Inc. The Company has not filed any formal trademark applications relating to Set.fm™ with the United States US Patent and Trademark Office but has been using these marks openly since 2017 and claims common law rights to them. Set.fm had been using its marks since 2014 prior to our acquisition of the assets.
 
We are a relatively new company. Our wholly-owned VNUE subsidiary commenced operations in calendar year 2015 and we have undertaken mainly organizational activities and software application development. Our independent auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern without significant additional financing. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we will continue to be dependent on additional debt and equity financing to maintain our operations and continue with our development activities.
 
Acquisitions will be pursued where the Directors consider that there is clear value through the addition of expertise, customers, monetization potential or geographic footprint.
 
Our principal offices are located at 104 W. 29th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10001. Our telephone number is 833-937-5493.

The History of VNUE
 
VNUE was founded in August of 2013 by Matthew Carona and Louis Mann with the vision of creating a collective network of connected venues that empower and assist bands, artists, and entertainers to monetize their performance (audio & video) in the venue using mobile technologies.
 
In 2014, VNUE acquired Lively LLC a Seattle based music technology company and direct-to-fan mobile platform that brings artists, fans, and brands together by capturing the live performance. In 2016, Zach Bair, CEO, took control of VNUE, and his team determined that the Lively IP, although valuable, had not been developed to the point where it could be deployed with major recording artist clients, and the decision was made to build and/or acquire other technologies which would help the company realize its goals. Bair and his team set out to immediately reset the company’s direction.
 
DiscLive™ Exclusive License-Related Party
 
On July 10, 2017, our wholly-owned VNUE subsidiary entered into a Licensing Agreement with RockHouse Live Media Productions, Inc., DBA “DiscLive” or “DiscLive Network” (“DiscLive”). DiscLive and related marks indicated herein are marks utilized by DiscLive and the Company disclaims rights to those names or marks) to formalize the terms of the Strategic Alliance entered into by the Company with DiscLive on July 21, 2016. This agreement provides VNUE with an exclusive license from DiscLive, for three years unless earlier terminated under the Agreement, for the use of all its assets, including but not limited to the DiscLive brand, website (including eCommerce platform), intellectual property, inventory, equipment, trade secrets and anything related to its business of “instant live” recording. Under the terms of the Agreement, DiscLive granted the Company a worldwide exclusive license for the foregoing rights. In exchange for the license, DiscLive receives a license fee equal to five percent (5%) of any sales derived from the sale and use of the products and services since the commencement of the agreement. DiscLive is controlled by our Chief Executive Officer. 
 
The Licensing Agreement was renewed for another three year period on March 1, 2021. All terms of the original agreement remain in full force and effect, and have remained in force throughout the expiration of the original agreement which was June 20, 2020. Additionally, this Amendment will auto-renew if neither party notifies the other in writing with the intent to cancel within 30 days of the expiration date.
 
Set.fm™ Acquisition
 
On October 16, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with PledgeMusic, Inc., whereby the Company acquired the assets of the digital live music distribution platform Set.fm™ from PledgeMusic . Set.fm™ allows us to record and sell live shows directly to fans’ mobile devices, uploading simultaneously with the artist’s performance, similar to the “instant live” physical distribution of DiscLive. The platform, which also features an innovative and easy-to-use DIY studio app, already boasts thousands of artists and tens of thousands of fans using it. VNUE has conducted updates and intends to continually update, the Set.fm™ platform, to update and improve it, and has leveraged the platform for major label music clients and will continue to roll out additional functionality.
Soundstr™ Acquisition
 
On April 23, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with MusicPlay Analytics, LLC (d/b/a Soundstr) (“Soundstr”) whereby the Company acquired the assets of Soundstr, a technology that aims to help businesses pay fairer music license fees based on actual music usage. 
 
The Company intends to continually update the above technologies, funds, and resources permitting.
 
Markets and Opportunity
 
Our business has two main “end users” or revenue sources:
 

• | the “consumer” side of the business, where we leverage our team’s expertise in recording live shows and releasing experiential content to fans immediately afterward (the “instant live” model), which consists of DiscLive, and Set.fm™, and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the emerging market of Music Recognition Technology (MRT), which is a B2B model whereby we identify music being played in bars, restaurants, other businesses, and radio stations, and tracing that music back to the original songwriters so that we can ensure the correct stakeholders are being paid. This is the Soundstr cloud and hardware technology. Eventually, we envision this functionality being merged together.

The following sections are broken up accordingly.
 
Set.fm™ & DiscLive™: “Instant Live Recording and Experiential Products”
 
DiscLive and set.fm™ provide fans with “instant” experiential content, so that they may walk out of a concert and take home their experience. The concert never ends with DiscLive and Set.fm™. With the increase in digital media (and related piracy issues), music concerts and related media and merchandising and events (e.g. post-concert shows etc.) are becoming the primary driver in music revenues today.
How Instant Live Recording Works?
 
Teams follow tours and record major artists and release high-quality products instantly via the set.fm™ mobile app and DiscLive physical products (online and onsite), capturing the emotion of the moment and translating that to sales. Set.fm™ also offers “indie” artists a free “Set.fm Studio” app to record themselves and sell their music on our platform. DiscLive is the pioneer, and VNUE CEO helmed that company since 2004, as well as EMI/Capitol Records version (2009-2012), called “Abbey Road Live”. Thousands of shows have been recorded all over the world and tens of thousands of products sold. Major artist clients (past and current) include Rob Thomas, Peter Frampton, King’s X, Bad Company, Slash, Seether, Devo, Blondie, and many others.
Size of the Instant Live Recording Market
 
According to a report published by Statistica in January 2021, the global music business is currently valued at $53.8 billion and expected to surpass $65 billion by 2023. Within that market, live music revenue is projected to be over $31 billion by 2022, according to Pricewaterhouse Coopers. With sufficient capital that will be deployed into sales, marketing, and branding resources, we believe that we can capture between $50-$100 million annually within three years with our experiential products.
Instant Live Recording
 
Revenue Model
 
Based on our team’s 17+ years of operations (through DiscLive, Abbey Road Live when aligned with EMI, and Set.fm), thousands of shows recorded around the world, and data collection available to us, we believe that the average sales conversion is 15%, with product prices averaging $25. This means that at a show of 1000 people attending, based on previous statistics, 150 of those people would purchase one of our products. With just ten tours of 20 tour dates each, and an audience of only 2,500 per show, the revenue potential is $1.875 million. We also market our products worldwide through our e-Commerce websites and through the effective use of social networks. No assurance can be made that past results will be indicative of future results however, and a number of economic and technological factors could adversely affect our consumer spending habits.
Growth Potential for Instant Live Recording
 
This is a model that is scaled through the use of technology, software, and hardware that we have specifically assembled to address our proprietary business practices which have been honed over the years, staffed with readily available contract personnel that we train specifically for our model. This does not age out. It is very much the “Ray Kroc” model, translated to music services, where the processes are repeatable, and we have an unbeatable product and service line. Since the business is primarily built on relationships, our ability to scale is only limited by access to capital. Scaling the opportunity is as simple as accessing the capital to acquire the equipment and contract labor to cover more tours.

Barriers to Entry & Obsolescence
 
We do not believe that our instant live recording business has any direct competitors at this time, and there are no known competitors to the Set.fm immediate distribution platform. Currently, fans merely take poor quality videos and audio recordings and just spread them (without obtaining intellectual property rights) on whatever social media they use. We believe, however, that our team has the time-tested trust of the music industry and proprietary processes and trade secrets developed over a decade that creates substantial barriers to entry. Management has found that other companies have tried to enter the space in different formats but none have the industry trust, business processes and trade secrets that the Company has developed. We believe that because our focus is on creating experiential content, delivered instantly, in the manner in which the fan wants it (particularly digitally), our user base will continue to grow with repeat users. As the industry evolves, so will the manner in which concert-goers consume their content, and VNUE management believes that continued R&D and marketing are necessary to stay a step ahead.
 
Unlike a typical startup, Set.fm and DiscLive is a real product offering with measurable results, recognized brands, and a leadership team with deep domain experience, execution, and relationships.
 
Soundstr™
 
VNUE acquired the Soundstr technology in mid-2018. Soundstr™ is a patent-pending hardware/cloud-based Music Recognition Technology (MRT) platform that some have compared to the app “Shazam,” but which is focused on businesses such as radio stations, bars, restaurants, and other real-world scenarios that involve the public performance of music.
How Soundstr Works; PROs?
 
Anywhere that music is played in a public setting, such as radio stations, bars, restaurants, etc., it must be licensed by law. Royalties are required to be paid to the creators (songwriters, publishers) or rights holders when that music played in a public domain. Organizations called “Performing Rights Organizations,” a.k.a. PROs, are responsible for assessing and collecting royalties. Unfortunately, there has previously been no technology to accurately track and audit exactly what music is being played, and consequently, licensees have to agree to “blanket” agreements, which are usually expensive, and whereby any music that a PRO is responsible for would be licensed, if it is theoretically played. The problem with this scenario is that due to the lack of tracking technology, there is inherent inaccuracy in which stakeholders (usually writers and artists) are paid, and further to that, in some cases, only a fraction of that PRO’s catalog may be played. Additionally, these business venues are so significant in number and yet so spread out in terms of location that this becomes extremely difficult to monitor let alone collect and enforce. This creates a massive market shortfall and discrepancy of licensing fees that would otherwise be generated from these businesses.
 
Soundstr™ has been created to address this, streamline it, and eliminate errors in royalty allocation. Soundstr™ listens to music, records it, and uploads it to the Cloud, where it is processed for identification via artificial intelligence (AI) and other means. Once the music is identified, several industry-leading databases are accessed to assemble deep metadata, and further processing is accomplished to build our own deep, authoritative database so that VNUE can create an accurate audit record of what has been played, and help to ensure the correct stakeholders are paid - while at the same time encouraging unlicensed venues to become licensed, and through the use of data, giving businesses the ability to negotiate more competitive licensing fees. Eventually, our system will support direct licensing. This creates a win for everyone involved - writers, publishers, artists, PROs, venues, and other stakeholders.
 
Size of the Soundstr™ Market
 
Based on FCC data, as of 2019 there are 15,330 radio stations in the USA, and over 44,000 worldwide (CIA, 2010). According to Statistica, there are over 700,000 bars, taverns and restaurants in the US, and millions globally. Between the combined segments there is more than $500 million potential in recurring revenue per year. There are even more opportunities in various other verticals.

Soundstr™ Revenue Model
 
Soundstr™ is a subscription model whereby radio stations and other businesses would “sign up” and subscribe for a monthly, annual, or other fees. This product line is currently about 80% complete, with our hardware already 100% complete). Further development is required for additional automation. Each location will be charged an installation fee and a monthly automated subscription charge. In addition to the subscription amount, we will also charge a percentage of the net savings from being able to reduce the licensing fees radio stations pay to PROs. For bars, restaurants, and other similar “brick and mortar” businesses we will likely charge a monthly fee, or it will be offered for free due to advertising revenue which will offset the monthly cost of the unit. Soundstr™ also has a built-in “beacon” technology to allow VNUE to push the aforementioned targeted advertising using geo-centric mobile applications. That revenue offsets the cost to the business owner and adds additional revenue to VNUE’s profit center.
Growth Potential for Soundstr™
 
Initially, Soundstr™ will be rolled out to radio, and then to brick and mortar establishments. There are already a handful of Soundstr units deployed for testing. There is more opportunity to scale quickly in radio, with large consolidated radio groups having single decision-makers, rather than thousands upon thousands of individual business owners. For radio stations and other “professional” clients, VNUE will install the Soundstr devices and provide fee-based services. We plan to roll out Soundstr™ as a self-installed item for brick and mortar establishments, which will be fulfilled via Amazon or a similar service, allowing for greater scale and lower cost. Currently there are approximately 450 Soundstr™ devices. We plan to have those devices deployed within 12 months or less, during which time our goal will be to raise additional funds to manufacture 10,000 or more units. The 450 units will get us to approximately $1.21 million in revenue deployed almost exclusively in radio stations as well as some physical locations. The deployment and roll out of existing and additional units is dependent upon funding. Assuming we are able to build and deploy 10,000 units, revenues will hit $36 million annually within three years, not taking into account additional revenues from the anticipated reduction in fees charged to clients by the PROs. It will take approximately $8-10 million to get us to $36 million in revenue. Our manufacturer has advised us that it is capable of manufacturing 10,000-20,000 units per month, with a three-month lead time for any engineering changes. Over time we hope to have both radio stations as well as other brick and mortar establishments and venues. This product also provides potential growth due to advertisement, sales of data etc. We believe that the data we will be collecting could potentially be one of the strongest revenue drivers.
Barriers to Entry & Obsolescence
 
Currently the PROs attempt to fill the void only in part, by employing statistical data and guesswork which, we believe leaves no room for independents or new media. Accordingly, we are not aware of any direct competitors. This market, we believe, is “white hot” however, and we believe will quickly become competitive. There is a great deal of interest in MRT, and some smaller startups in Europe have deployed technology to track DJ music (electronic), which is only a small subset of what we are able to capture (live, recorded, DJ, karaoke, radio, etc.).
 
We have patent-pending technology, USPTO Application US 2017/0316089, “System and Method for Capturing, Archiving and Controlling Content in a Performance Venue,” which creates a significant barrier to entry, and we expect to file more IP protection as we are funded. Another barrier to entry is the executive team, which has considerable success in the domain, as well as deep relationships. Because the system is predominantly Cloud-based, with software that evolves, we intend to continue to maintain and update the software to remain relevant and effective. Our hardware is tablet-based with some customized casing and components, and as technology continues to improve, our hardware will evolve as well, but will remain backward compatible. Additionally, as additional barriers to entry, we anticipate building open-architecture rack-mounted units, software plug-ins to compliment professional recording software and track internet radio, and in fact, we expect to combine Soundstr technology into Set.fm, so we can identify music we are recording on-the-fly and eventually enable “instant” and seamless licensing. This new technology be protected through additional patent filings.

Key Business Strengths
 
Management believes that the key factors or features of our business that will contribute to VNUE’s success are:
 
Expertise and experience in “Instant Live” Content Production and Distribution - VNUE’s team members have been involved in the business of instant live content since 2003. VNUE’s CEO pioneered this concept and commercialized it with the original DiscLive in 2004, and has continued over the years to develop the processes and methodologies used to gain trust and a competitive advantage in the music business. Due to this lengthy history, and trust by major labels, management companies, and related parties, VNUE should remain in a position of strength in terms of this model, and plans to continue to develop the model and introduce new innovative and immersive software features to fans.
Intellectual Property - VNUE has pending patents for our Soundstr™ technology, and expects to file more related patents around the Soundstr™ platform, as well as Set.fm™.
 
The Company has not filed any formal trademark applications relating to Set.fm™ or Soundstr™ with the United States US Patent and Trademark Office but has been using these marks openly since approximately fall 2017 and spring 2018 respectively, although both marks had been in use well before our acquisition of the assets.
 
We have patent-pending technology, USPTO Application US 2017/0316089, “System and Method for Capturing, Archiving and Controlling Content in a Performance Venue” which relates to our Soundstr™ technology.
 
Employees
 
We currently have 2 full-time and 5 part-time employees. We also currently engage independent contractors in the areas of accounting, legal and auditing services, corporate finance, as well as marketing and business development. The remuneration paid to our officers and directors will be more completely described elsewhere in our audited financial statements. We do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed.
Reports to Security Holders
 
We are subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act and we intend to furnish our shareholder's annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. We file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet our timely and continuous disclosure requirements. We may also file additional documents with the Commission if they become necessary in the course of our company’s operations.
 
The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
As stated above we have patents pending for our Soundstr™ technology, and expect to file more patents and trademarks around technology we are developing or have already developed, or plan to develop, funds permitting. We will continue to assess the need for any copyright, trademark, or patent applications on an ongoing basis.
Research and Development
 
We spent $12,404 on research and development activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to the development of our proprietary software. Due to limited operations in 2020 due to the impact of Covid-19, we did not have any research and development expenses in 2020.

Subsidiaries
 
The Company consolidates the following subsidiaries and/or entities:
 

Name of consolidated subsidiary or Entity | State or other jurisdiction of incorporation or organization | Date of incorporation or formation (date of acquisition/disposition, if applicable) | Attributable interest | 
------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+--
VNUE Inc. (formerly TGRI) | The State of Nevada | April 4, 2006 (May 29, 2015) | 100 | %
VNUE Inc. (VNUE Washington) | The State of Washington | October 16, 2014 | 100 | %
VNUE LLC | The State of Washington | August 1, 2013 (December 3, 2014) | 100 | %



The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the subsidiaries/entities as of reporting periods end date and for the reporting periods then ended from their respective dates of incorporation/formation, acquisition, or disposition.
 
Environmental Laws
 
We believe that our operations do not have a material effect on the environment nor do environmental regulations have a material impact on our current operations.
Recent Developments
 
Impact of Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Company
 
Covid-19 has had a material adverse effect on our live recording business and the music industry in general. A material portion of our future set.fm and DiscLive business is dependent on success of public events and gatherings. In the event that quarantine and social distancing rules or even social fears continue through such time then we will be materially adversely affected, as these gatherings will see fewer attendees.
