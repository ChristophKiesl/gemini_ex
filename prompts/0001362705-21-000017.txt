Item 1.Business
Overview
We are a publicly-traded limited partnership formed in 2005 focused on the acquisition, development and ownership of infrastructure critical to the transition of energy supply to lower carbon sources. We own natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, and processing facilities in South Texas and continue to pursue energy transition infrastructure opportunities. Our common units are currently listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “SNMP.”
On February 26, 2021, in connection with our management team’s focus on expanding our business strategy to focus on the ongoing energy transition in the industries in which we operate, we changed our name to Evolve Transition Infrastructure LP and our general partner changed its name to Evolve Transition Infrastructure GP LLC.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As a result, extraordinary and wide-ranging actions were taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, government restrictions on movement, business closures and suspensions, canceled events and activities, self-isolation, and other voluntary or mandated changes in behavior. Such actions have also resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including supply chain disruptions, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and limitations on the availability of workforces. COVID-19 and the ongoing response to mitigate its impact have contributed to a massive economic shutdown and decreased demand for crude oil and natural gas.
Also in the first quarter of 2020, Saudi Arabia and Russia increased production of crude oil as the two countries competed for market share. As a result, the global supply of crude oil significantly exceeded demand and led to a collapse in crude oil prices. The collapse in crude oil prices and the related impact on crude oil drilling resulted in crude oil, natural gas and NGL production being curtailed in the second quarter of 2020.
While crude oil prices have started to rebound from the lows reached during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the volatility in oil prices and impact of the Mesquite Chapter 11 Case (as defined below) have caused a negative impact on our net cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2020. If Mesquite should decide to shut-in any of the wells connected to our midstream facilities or otherwise becomes unable to make future payments under the Gathering Agreement, it could have a material and adverse impact on our business. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business and operations will depend on the severity, location and duration of the effects and spread of COVID-19, the actions undertaken by national, regional and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume. Please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Mesquite Bankruptcy – Settlement Agreement and Rejection Lawsuits
On August 11, 2019, the SN Debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy code in the Bankruptcy Court, jointly administered under Case No. 19-34508 (the “Mesquite Chapter 11 Case”).
On June 6, 2020 the Partnership, our general partner and certain of our subsidiaries entered into the Settlement Agreement. On June 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Settlement Agreement and the parties to the Settlement Agreement entered into or amended certain commercial contracts, including but not limited to, (i) Amendment No. 2 to the Gathering Agreement (“Amendment No. 2”),(ii) that certain Firm Transportation Service Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2020, by and between Seco Pipeline, LLC and SN Catarina, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mesquite (the “Seco Catarina Agreement”), and (iii) that certain Firm Transportation Service Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2020, by and between Seco Pipeline, LLC and SN EF Maverick, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of 

6



Mesquite (the “Seco Comanche Agreement”). Each such agreement will become effective only upon satisfaction of certain closing conditions described in the Settlement Agreement.
On June 23, 2020, certain affiliates of each Occidental Petroleum Corp., The Blackstone Group and GSO Capital Partners each filed a complaint (collectively, the “Rejection Lawsuits”) against Mesquite and certain of its subsidiaries requesting, among other things, that the Bankruptcy Court not approve the rejection of certain commercial agreements, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement, in connection with Mesquite’s Comanche Asset (as defined herein). 
On June 30, 2020, the SN Debtors emerged from the Mesquite Chapter 11 Case, with Mesquite becoming a privately held corporation.
The commercial agreements contemplated by the Settlement Agreement will not become effective until, among other things, the Rejection Lawsuits have been resolved in favor of the SN Debtors and the Bankruptcy Court has approved the rejection of the certain commercial agreements underlying the Rejection Lawsuits. The Rejection Lawsuits were not resolved by October 1, 2020, and as a result the parties to the Settlement Agreement may terminate the Settlement Agreement at any time pursuant to its terms. To date, none of the parties of the Settlement Agreement have provided notice of termination.
Our Relationship with Stonepeak 
Since October 14, 2015, Stonepeak Catarina has owned all of our issued and outstanding preferred units. As of March 16, 2021, Stonepeak owned (i) 39,623,443 common units, representing approximately 72.7% of our outstanding common units, (ii) all of our issued and outstanding Class C Preferred Units, (iii) a warrant (the “Warrant”) that entitled Stonepeak Catarina to receive junior securities of the Partnership (including common units) representing 10% of all junior securities deemed outstanding when exercised, (iv) the non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership and (v) all of our incentive distribution rights. Stonepeak also owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests in SP Holdings, which is the sole member of our general partner. SP Holdings has the right to appoint all of the members of the Board of directors other than two directors which Stonepeak Catarina is entitled to designate pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Board Representation and Standstill Agreement, dated as of August 2, 2019. As a result of the foregoing, Stonepeak controls us and our general partner and has the ability to appoint all of the members of the Board. 
Stonepeak Catarina is indirectly managed by Stonepeak Partners LP, a leading North American infrastructure private equity firm (“Stonepeak Partners”). Stonepeak Partners’ significant infrastructure and midstream energy expertise and deep financial resources are reflected in over $31 billion of assets under management, with investments to date including, among others, preferred and common interests in the Partnership, MPLX LP, Phillips 66 Partners LP, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Targa Resources Corp. We believe that, as a result of Stonepeak’s significant ownership interest in us, Stonepeak is incentivized to support and promote our business plan and to encourage us to pursue projects that enhance the overall value of our business. While our relationship with Stonepeak is a significant strength, it is also a source of potential risks and conflicts. Please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in an Investment in Our Common Units” and “Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | production business, which includes non-operated oil and natural gas interests located in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and in other areas of Texas and Louisiana.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For information about our segments’ revenues, profits and losses and total assets, see Note 17 “Reporting Segments” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Midstream Business
Western Catarina Midstream
In October 2015, we acquired (the “Catarina Transaction”) a gathering system from Mesquite (“Western Catarina Midstream”), which is located on the western portion of Mesquite’s acreage position in Dimmit, La Salle and Webb counties in Texas (such net acreage is collectively referred to herein as “Mesquite’s Catarina Asset,” and the western portion of such net acreage is individually referred to herein as “Western Catarina”). Western Catarina Midstream consists of approximately 160 miles of gathering pipelines, four main processing and gathering facilities, including stabilizers, storage tanks, compressors and dehydration units, and other related assets in Western Catarina, which are located in Dimmit and Webb counties in Texas, and services upstream production from assets located in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. The gathering lines range in diameter from four to 12 inches, with a capacity of 200 MMcf/d for natural gas, and 40 MBbl/d for crude oil and NGLs. There are four main gathering and processing facilities, which includes eight stabilizers of 5,000 Bbls/d, approximately 25,000 Bbls of storage capacity, pressurized storage for NGLs, approximately 23,000 horsepower of compression and approximately 300 MMcf/d of dehydration capacity. The gathering system is currently used solely to support the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil produced by Mesquite at Mesquite’s Catarina Asset. The gathering system has oil interconnects with the Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. header system delivered to the Gardendale terminal, and to all four takeaway pipelines to Corpus Christi, and natural gas interconnects with Southcross Energy Partners, L.P., Kinder Morgan Inc., Energy Transfer Operating, L.P. and Targa Resources Corp.
In conjunction with the Catarina Transaction, we entered into a 15-year firm gas gathering and processing agreement with Mesquite, pursuant to which Mesquite agreed to tender all of its crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbon-based product volumes on approximately 35,000 dedicated acres in Western Catarina for processing and transportation through Western Catarina Midstream, with the potential to tender additional volumes outside of the dedicated acreage (the “Gathering Agreement”).
All of the revenues from Western Catarina Midstream are currently earned from Mesquite. Under the Gathering Agreement, Mesquite was contractually obligated to meet a minimum quarterly volume delivery commitment for oil and natural gas, subject to certain adjustments, however, this contractual requirement expired in 2020. In addition, Mesquite is required to pay contractually agreed upon gathering and processing fees for oil and natural gas volumes tendered through Western Catarina Midstream. In June 2017, the Gathering Agreement was amended to add an incremental infrastructure fee to be paid by Mesquite based on water that was delivered to Western Catarina Midstream through March 31, 2018. Since March 31, 2018, we have agreed with Mesquite to continue adding the incremental infrastructure fee on a month-to-month basis.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Mesquite transported average daily production through Western Catarina Midstream of approximately 7.4 MBbls/d of oil, 93.6 MMcf/d of natural gas and 3.1 MBbls/d of water. The average age 

8



of the Western Catarina Midstream assets is approximately nine years, and such assets have an average expected life of approximately 20 additional years. 
Carnero JV
In May 2018, we executed a series of agreements with Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) (“Targa”) and other parties pursuant to which, among other things: (1) the parties merged their respective 50% interests in Carnero Gathering, LLC (“Carnero Gathering”) and Carnero Processing, LLC (“Carnero Processing”) (the “Carnero JV Transaction”) to form an expanded 50 / 50 joint venture in South Texas, Carnero G&P, LLC (“Carnero JV”), (2) Targa contributed 100% of the equity interest in the Silver Oak II Gas Processing Plant located in Bee County, Texas (“Silver Oak II”), to Carnero JV, which expanded the processing capacity of the joint venture from 260 MMcf/d to 460 MMcf/d, (3) Targa contributed certain capacity in the 45 miles of high pressure natural gas gathering pipelines owned by Carnero Gathering that connect Western Catarina Midstream to nearby pipelines and the Raptor Gas Processing Facility (the “Carnero Gathering Line”) to Carnero JV resulting in the joint venture owning all of the capacity in the Carnero Gathering Line, which has a design limit (without compression) of 400 MMcf/d, (4) Carnero JV received a new dedication from Mesquite and its working interest partners of over 315,000 acres located in the Western Eagle Ford on Mesquite’s acreage in Dimmit, Webb, La Salle, Zavala and Maverick counties in Texas (such acreage is collectively referred to herein as “Mesquite’s Comanche Asset”) pursuant to a new long-term firm gas gathering and processing agreement. The agreement with Mesquite, which was approved by all of the unaffiliated Comanche non-operated working interest owners, establishes commercial terms for the gathering of gas on the Carnero Gathering Line and processing at the Raptor Gas Processing Facility and Silver Oak II. Prior to execution of the agreement, Comanche volumes were gathered and processed on an interruptible basis, with the processing capabilities of the joint ventures limited by the capacity of the 260 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant in La Salle County, Texas (the “Raptor Gas Processing Facility”).
Seco Pipeline
In August 2017, we completed construction of a 100% owned and operated 30-mile natural gas pipeline with 400 MMcf/d capacity that is designed and used to transport dry gas from the Raptor Gas Processing Facility to multiple markets in South Texas (the “Seco Pipeline”). The Seco Pipeline provides upstream producers with optionality to southern gas markets and creates the potential to export natural gas to premium priced markets in Mexico. On September 1, 2017, we entered into a firm transportation service agreement with Mesquite to transport certain quantities of Mesquite’s natural gas on a firm basis through the Seco Pipeline for $0.22 per MMBtu delivered on or after September 1, 2017 (the “Seco Pipeline Transportation Agreement”). The Seco Pipeline Transportation Agreement had an initial term of one month and renewed automatically on a month-to-month basis. Mesquite terminated the Seco Pipeline Transportation Agreement effective February 12, 2020. From January 1, 2020 through February 12, 2020, the effective date of the Seco Pipeline Transportation Agreement termination, Mesquite transported an insignificant amount of gas through the Seco Pipeline. The Seco Pipeline has an expected life of approximately 40 years.
Title to Properties
Title to Western Catarina Midstream and the Seco Pipeline assets are either owned in fee or derived from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license that is held by us or to the title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease we own, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of the material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses with respect to all Western Catarina Midstream and Seco Pipeline assets.
Production Business
Our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2020, were approximately 2.3 MMBoe, all of which were classified as proved developed, with 13% being natural gas, 12% being NGLs, and 75% being oil. At December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 47 net producing wells. Our total average proved reserve-to-production ratio is approximately 9 years and our portfolio decline rate is 11% based on our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2020.
Below is a description of our operations and our oil and natural gas properties by basin at December 31, 2020:

9



Locations
All of our reserves were located in the Eagle Ford Shale on non-operated properties. Production during the year ended December 31, 2020 on these properties was 237.7 MBoe and approximately 2,283.4 MBoe of estimated proved reserves were held at December 31, 2020. All of these reserves were classified as proved developed, with 13% being natural gas, 12% being NGLs, and 75% being oil.
We also own non-operated properties in Louisiana. During the year ended December 31, 2020, production on Louisiana properties was 3.5 MBoe.
Operations
We do not currently operate any of our production assets. The Eagle Ford Shale properties are operated by either Sanchez Oil & Gas Corporation (“SOG”), Mesquite or Marathon Oil Company and the Louisiana properties are operated by another prudent operator.
Proved Reserves of Natural Gas, NGLs, and Oil
The following table reflects our estimates for proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves based on the SEC definitions that were used to prepare our financial statements for the periods presented. The standardized measure values shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market values of our estimated proved reserves.

​

(a) | Standardized measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves. It is determined using SEC-required prices and costs in effect as of the time of estimation without giving effect to non-property related expenses (such as general and administrative expenses or debt service costs) and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Our standardized measure does not include the impact of derivative transactions or future federal income taxes because we are not subject to federal income taxes. Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The standardized measure shown should not be considered the current market value of our reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is required, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. Please read “Part I, item 1A. Risk Factors.”

​
Our 2020 estimates of total proved reserves decreased 716 MBoe from 2019 due to production and revisions of previous estimates of 241 MBoe and 475 MBoe, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, we had no remaining proved undeveloped reserves in our reserves base.
We expect to make minimal capital expenditures related to recompletion of existing wells during the year ending December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Ryder Scott Co. LP (“Ryder Scott”), an independent oil and natural gas engineering firm, prepared estimates of all our proved reserves. We used these estimates of our proved reserves to prepare our financial statements. Ryder Scott maintains a degreed staff of highly competent technical personnel. The average experience level of Ryder Scott’s technical staff of engineers, geoscientists and petrophysicists exceeds 20 years, including five to 15 years with a major oil company. The engineering information presented in their report was overseen

Drilling Activity 
With respect to oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that are capable of producing commercial quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return. No exploratory wells were drilled on any of our properties during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no wells drilled and there were no wells in progress. 
Developed and Undeveloped Acreage 
The following table sets forth information related to our leasehold acreage as of December 31, 2020. 
​

Total | | 702 | | 140 | | — | | — | ​

​

(a) | Developed acres are acres pooled within or assigned to productive wells/units.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or acres that have not been pooled into a productive unit.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is either fully or partially leased. The number of gross acres may include minerals not under lease as a result of leasing some but not all joint mineral owners under any given tract.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leases
Most of our reserves are comprised of wellbore rights only. We have a small lease position of less than 150 net acres in Louisiana.
Marketing and Major Customers
Our oil and natural gas production in Texas and Louisiana is marketed by the operators of our properties.
Mesquite accounted for 80% and 86% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are highly dependent upon Mesquite as our most significant customer, and we expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from Mesquite in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Mesquite. Any development that materially and adversely affects Mesquite’s operations or financial condition could have a material adverse impact on us. For additional information on the risks associated with our relationship with Mesquite, please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Markets and Competition
We operate in a competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil, NGLs and natural gas and retaining trained personnel. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than us. As a result, our competitors may be able to outbid us for assets, more competitively price their gathering and transportation services and oil and natural gas production, or utilize superior technical resources than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional assets will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable assets and to consummate transactions in a competitive environment.
The natural gas gathering, compression, treating and transportation business is very competitive. Upon such time that we seek to obtain customers in addition to Mesquite for Western Catarina Midstream, our competitors will include other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies.

Stonepeak is not restricted from competing with us. Please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Stonepeak Catarina and its affiliates, including our general partner, will have conflicts of interest with us. They will not owe any fiduciary duties to us or our common unitholders, but instead will owe us and our common unitholders limited contractual duties, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our other common unitholders.” Additional information regarding our relationship with Stonepeak is provided in “Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
Governmental Regulation
Environmental Laws
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
​

● | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances, including water and waste, that can be released into the environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | limit or prohibit activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible in the absence of such regulations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. In addition, federal, state and local authorities frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
Environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on the oil and natural gas industry and our operations include the following:
Waste Handling
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes and non-hazardous wastes. With the approval of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluid, produced water and most other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. Although we do not believe that the current costs of managing any of our wastes are material under presently applicable laws, any future reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes, could increase our costs to manage and dispose of wastes.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons can include the owners or operators of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, including response costs, alternative water supplies, damages to natural resources and the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property 

13



damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Each state also has environmental cleanup laws analogous to CERCLA.
We currently own, lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas production for a number of years. Although we believe that operating and waste disposal practices utilized in the past with respect to these properties were typical for the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose practices, including the treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future environmental harm.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”), and comparable state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and natural gas wastes, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, impose investigatory or remedial obligations and issue injunctions limiting or preventing our operations for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
Oil Pollution Act
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amended the Clean Water Act in large part due to the Exxon Valdez incident. Under the Oil Pollution Act, the EPA was directed to promulgate regulations which would create a comprehensive prevention, response, liability and compensation program to deal with oil discharged into United States navigable waters. The Oil Pollution Act imposes ongoing requirements on owners and operators of facilities that handle certain quantities of crude oil, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with a spill. The Oil Pollution Act imposes liability for removal costs and damages resulting from an incident in which oil is discharged into navigable waters and establishes liability for damages for injuries to, or loss of, natural resources.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that lower the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 parts per billion (“ppb”) to 70 ppb, and the EPA published a final rule in July 2018 completing the final designations. States can also impose air emissions limitations that are more stringent than the federal standards imposed by the EPA. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Rules restricting air emissions may require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our operating results. However, we believe that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by any such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with federal and state air emission standards.
Climate Change 
While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In 

14



the absence of such federal climate legislation, the EPA has used existing authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate GHGs. For example, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from various oil and natural gas operations on an annual basis. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) Subpart OOOOa standards that require new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay portions of the Subpart OOOOa standards for two years. In September 2018, the EPA issued proposed revisions to the NSPS applicable to new and modified oil and gas sources, which would reduce the monitoring obligations for wells and compressor stations. Further in October 2018, the EPA issued a draft report which includes a template designed to assist with compliance. In August 2020, EPA issued two final rules that will make it simpler for the oil and gas industry to comply with NSPS. The first policy amendments remove the transmission and storage segment from the rule, rescind VOC and methane emission standards for that segment and rescind methane emission standards for the production and processing segments. The second simplifies compliance requirements. A number of state and regional efforts have also emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to possess and acquire emission allowances which permit corresponding GHG emissions. Furthermore, the U.S. is currently a party to the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 to reduce global GHG emissions. However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in accordance with the Agreement’s four-year exit process and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and on November 4, 2020 the United States officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order to have the United States rejoin the Paris Agreement. On November 4,2020 the withdrawal took effect. However, on January 20, 2021 President Biden signed an Executive Order to reverse the withdrawal and the United States formally re-joined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. Additionally, President Biden has issued an executive order seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise or rescind prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices and has finalized a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, finding that under certain circumstances, the “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources. In 2014, the EPA released an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on its plans to issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 to require companies to disclose information regarding chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Further, the Department of the Interior has released final regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on federal oil and natural gas leases which require lessees to file for approval of well stimulation work before commencement of operations and require well operators to disclose the trade names and purposes of additives used in the fracturing fluids. The states in which we operate have also adopted disclosure requirements related to fracturing fluids. Legislation has been introduced, but not adopted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Currently, no states in which we utilize hydraulic fracturing have adopted these regulations. In addition, President Biden has declared that he would support federal government efforts to limit or prohibit hydraulic fracturing. These declarations include threats to take actions banning hydraulic fracturing of crude oil and natural gas wells and banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days. In addition, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. Among the areas that could be affected by the review are regulations addressing hydraulic fracturing. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how these recent actions and future rules and rulemaking initiatives under the Biden administration will impact our business.

Endangered Species
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions and may materially delay or prohibit land access for development. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the FWS was required to make a determination on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our activities.
Gathering System Regulation
Regulation of gathering facilities may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation, gathering, and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and by FERC regulations. 
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of substantial litigation and varying interpretations. In addition, the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our natural gas gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts, or the U.S. Congress. If the FERC were to determine that an individual gathering system is not exempt from FERC regulation and the pipelines associated with such gathering system provide interstate transportation, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such gathering system would be subject to regulation by the FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. If any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the cost-based rate established by the FERC. 
Gathering services, which may occur upstream of transmission service subject to FERC jurisdiction, is regulated by the states. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Our purchasing and gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the State of Texas. The ratable take statute generally requires gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, the common purchaser statute generally requires gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport gas.
The Railroad Commission of Texas (“TRRC”) requires gatherers to file reports, obtain permits, make books and records available for audit and provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis. Shippers and producers may file complaints with the TRRC to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination.

While our gathering systems have not been regulated by the FERC under the NGA, the U.S. Congress may enact legislation or the FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas gatherers with which we compete. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by the FERC, and furthermore provides the FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EPAct 2005 provided the FERC with the power to assess daily civil penalties for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”). The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In Order No. 670, the FERC promulgated rules implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EPAct 2005. The rules make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to: (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. 
Pipeline Safety Regulation
We are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) through the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), pursuant to the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (“HLPSA”) and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, inspection, testing, construction, operation, replacement and maintenance of pipeline facilities. HLPSA, as amended, governs he design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of crude oil pipeline facilities and also covers petroleum and petroleum products, including NGLs and condensate, and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations, to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. These regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these HLPSA regulations.
Our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (“NGPSA”) and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (“PSIA”), as reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (“PIPES Act”). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”). 
PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to: 

● | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact HCAs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improve data collection, integration and analysis;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | implement preventive and mitigating actions.
--+---------------------------------------------

The HLPSA has been amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Pipeline Safety Act”) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (“2016 Pipeline Safety Act The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act doubled the maximum administrative fines for safety violations from $100,000 to $200,000 for a single violation and from $1 million to $2 million for a related series of violations, but provided that these maximum penalty caps do not apply to certain civil enforcement actions. Effective April 27, 2017, to account for inflation, those maximum civil penalties were increased to $213,268 per day, with a maximum of $2,132,679 for a series of violations. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act extended PHMSA’s statutory mandate through 2019. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowers PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued interim regulations in October 2016 to implement the agency’s expanded authority to address unsafe pipeline conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property, or the environment.
PHMSA regularly revises its pipeline safety regulations and has published advanced notices of proposed rulemakings and notices of proposed rulemaking to solicit comments on the need for changes to its natural gas and liquid pipeline safety regulations. In the past few years, PHMSA issued advisory bulletins providing guidance on applicable regulatory requirements, including those that must be followed for the abandonment of a pipeline; aspects of overall pipeline integrity, including the need for corrosion-control systems on buried and insulated pipeline segments, to conduct in-line inspections for all threats, and to ensure in-line inspection tool findings are accurate and verified; the need of owners and operators of natural gas facilities to take appropriate steps to prevent damage to pipeline facilities from accumulated snow or ice; actions pipeline operators should consider taking to ensure the integrity of pipelines in the event of severe flooding or hurricane damage; notice of construction; flow reversal procedures; product changes and conversion; integrity management program evaluation metrics; and incident response plans. Further changes to PHMSA’s rules are expected in the future. 
For example, in July 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing, among other things, to extend operator qualification requirements to operators of certain natural gas gathering lines and to add a specific timeframe for operators’ notifications of accidents or incidents. In January 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule adding a specific timeframe for operators’ notifications of accidents or incidents but delayed final action on the operator qualification proposals until a later date. The final rule became effective March 24, 2017. In addition, in October 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing changes to its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations, including to extend: (i) reporting requirements to all onshore or offshore, regulated or unregulated hazardous liquid gathering lines; and (ii) certain integrity management periodic assessment and remediation requirements to regulated onshore gathering lines. On January 13, 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule amending its regulations to impose new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all hazardous liquid gathering lines. The final rule also significantly extends and expands the reach of certain integrity management requirements, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to HCAs. However, this final rule remains subject to review and approval by the new administration, pursuant to a memorandum issued by the White House to heads of federal agencies. It is unclear whether the final rule will be revised and when it will be implemented. In April 2016, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would expand integrity management requirements and impose new pressure requirements on currently regulated gas transmission pipelines and would also significantly expand the regulation of gas gathering lines, subjecting previously unregulated pipelines to requirements regarding damage prevention, corrosion control, public education programs, maximum allowable operating pressure limits and other requirements. On October 1, 2019, PHMSA issued its final rule which became effective July 1, 2020. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such regulatory changes and any legislative changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations.
Furthermore, DOT regulations have incorporated by reference the American Petroleum Institute Standard 653 (“API 653”) as the industry standard for the inspection, repair, alteration and reconstruction of storage tanks. API 653 requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of such tanks. These periodic tank maintenance requirements may result in 

18



significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our storage tanks.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the DOT to assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. For example, in Texas the Pipeline Safety Department of the TRRC inspects and enforces the pipeline safety regulations for intrastate pipelines, including gathering lines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include more stringent requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements. 
We have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs, based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity gathered on our system, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs.
Other Laws and Regulation
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communications standard, OSHA Process Safety Management, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements.
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had no accrued environmental obligations. We are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures or that will otherwise have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, we cannot predict how future environmental laws and regulations may impact our operations, and therefore, cannot provide assurance that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital
Headcount
We do not have any employees. Pursuant to the terms of the Operational Services Agreement, our subsidiary SNMP Services provides us and certain of our subsidiaries, including SEP Holdings IV, LLC, Catarina Midstream, LLC and SECO Pipeline, LLC, with payroll, human resources, employee benefits and other consulting services we mutually agree upon with SNMP Services. Following the effective date of the Operational Services Agreement, SOG no longer provides any employees or support staff for our business. As of March 16, 2021, thirteen (13) employees were employed by SNMP Services with their primary function being to provide services for us, all of which were full-time employees. None of SNMP Services’ employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. When we refer to “our employees” in this Form 10-K we are referring the SNMP Services’ employees. Our success is due in large part to the skills, experience and dedication of such employees. 
Employee Safety
We believe our responsibility to our employees, neighbors, shareholders and the environment is only fulfilled through our commitment to safety and reliability. Through training, continuous monitoring and promoting a culture of excellence in operations, we continuously strive to keep our people, the communities in which we operate in and the 

19



environment safe. By monitoring the integrity of our assets and promoting the safety of our employees, we are investing in the long-term sustainability of our business. 
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
In response to COVID-19, we have taken steps to manage the potential impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our employees. We continue to practice remote work procedures when possible to protect the safety of our employees and their families, and have taken extra precautions for our employees who work in the field or cannot otherwise work remotely, such as social distancing, face covering protocols and sanitation procedures. 
Development and Retention
In managing our human capital resources, we use a strategic approach to building a diverse, inclusive, and respectful workplace. SNMP Services provides expertise and tools to attract, develop, and retain diverse talent and support our employees’ career and development goals. We value our employees’ opinions and encourage them to engage with management and ask questions on topics such as our goals, challenges, and employee concerns. 
We believe that a combination of competitive compensation and career growth and development opportunities help increase employee morale and reduce voluntary turnover. Our comprehensive benefit packages are competitive in the marketplace and we believe in recognizing and rewarding talent through our various compensation programs.
Health and Welfare
We provide a variety of benefits to help promote the health and welfare of our employees and their families. These benefits include medical, dental, vision plans and virtual health visits. Eligible employees also have access, at no charge, to an employee assistance program.
Offices
Our principal executive offices are located at 1360 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 2400, Houston, Texas 77056. Our telephone number is (713) 783-8000.
