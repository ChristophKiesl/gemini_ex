General
 
We are engaged primarily in two business segments: movie theatres and hotels and resorts.
 
As of December 29, 2016, our theatre operations included 68 movie theatres with 885 screens throughout Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Ohio, including two movie theatres with 11 screens in Wisconsin and Nebraska owned by third parties and managed by us. We also operate a family entertainment center, Funset Boulevard, that is adjacent to one of our theatres in Appleton, Wisconsin, and own the Ronnie’s Plaza retail outlet in St. Louis, Missouri, an 84,000 square foot retail center featuring 21 shops and other businesses to which we lease retail space. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are the 4th largest theatre circuit in the United States.
 
As of December 29, 2016, our hotels and resorts operations included eight wholly-owned or majority-owned and operated hotels and resorts in Wisconsin, Illinois, Nebraska and Oklahoma. We also managed 10 hotels, resorts and other properties for third parties in Wisconsin, California, Georgia, Minnesota, Nevada and Texas. As of December 29, 2016, we owned or managed approximately 4,992 hotel and resort rooms.
 
Both of these business segments are discussed in detail below. For information regarding the revenues, operating income or loss, assets and certain other financial information of these segments for the last three full fiscal years and for our Transition Period ended December 31, 2015, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Note 12 in Part II below.

Fiscal Year
 
In October 2015, we elected to change our fiscal year from the last Thursday in May to the last Thursday in December. As a result, on March 15, 2016, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K for the transition period beginning on May 29, 2015 and ended December 31, 2015, which we refer to in this Annual Report as the “Transition Period.” We refer in this Annual Report to the period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ended December 29, 2016 as “fiscal 2016.” We refer in this Annual Report to the period beginning on May 30, 2014 and ended on May 28, 2015 as “fiscal 2015,” and the period beginning on May 31, 2013 and ended on May 29, 2014 as “fiscal 2014.” In this Annual Report, we compare (1) financial results for fiscal 2016, which are audited, with the financial results for the 53-week period ended December 31, 2015, which are unaudited; (2) financial results for the Transition Period, which are audited, with financial results for the 30-week period ended December 25, 2014, which are unaudited; and (3) financial results for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which are audited.
Strategic Plans
 
Please see our discussion under “Current Plans” in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Theatre Operations
 
At the end of fiscal 2016, we owned or operated 68 movie theatre locations with a total of 885 screens in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Ohio. We averaged 13.0 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2016, compared to 12.6 screens per location at the end of the Transition Period, 12.4 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2015 and 12.5 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2014. Included in the fiscal 2016, Transition Period, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 totals are two theatres with 11 screens that we manage for other owners. Our 66 company-owned facilities include 47 megaplex theatres (12 or more screens), representing approximately 81% of our total screens, 18 multiplex theatres (two to 11 screens) and one single-screen theatre. At the fiscal year-end, we operated 860 first-run screens, 11 of which we operated under management contracts, and 25 budget-oriented screens.
 
In addition to a significant theatre acquisition in fiscal 2016, we invested nearly $185 million to further enhance the movie-going experience and amenities in new and existing theatres over the last three and one-half calendar years, with more investments planned for fiscal 2017. These investments include:
 
New theatres. Late in our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, we opened a theatre in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, the Marcus Palace Cinema. Replacing an existing nearby theatre in Madison, Wisconsin, this new 12-screen theatre has exceeded our expectations, and we opened two additional screens at this location during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we purchased land and began construction on two new theatres. We expect to open a 10-screen theatre in Shakopee, Minnesota during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 that will feature all reserved DreamLoungerSM recliner seating in every auditorium, two UltraScreen DLX® auditoriums, a Zaffiro’s® Express and a Take Five LoungeSM. We expect to open our first stand-alone all in-theatre dining location, an eight-screen theatre that will be branded BistroPlexSM, in Greendale, Wisconsin during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition, we are looking for additional sites for potential new theatre locations in both new and existing markets.

Theatre acquisitions. We believe acquisitions of existing theatres or theatre circuits is also a viable growth strategy for us. In April 2016, we purchased a closed 16-screen theatre in Country Club Hills, Illinois, which is now our sixth theatre in the greater Chicago area, building on our strong presence in the Chicago southern suburbs. The purchase was part of an Internal Revenue Code §1031 like-kind exchange in which the tax gain from our October 2015 sale of the real estate related to the Hotel Phillips was deferred by reinvesting the applicable proceeds in replacement real estate within a prescribed time period. We opened the newly renovated theatre early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The renovation added DreamLounger recliner seating to all auditoriums, added one UltraScreen DLX auditorium and two SuperScreen DLX® auditoriums, as well as a Take Five Lounge and Reel Sizzle® outlet. In December 2016, we acquired the assets of Wehrenberg Theatres® (which we refer to as Wehrenberg), a family-owned and operated theatre circuit based in St. Louis, Missouri with 197 screens at 14 locations in Missouri, Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota. This acquisition increased our total number of screens by 29%. The movie theatre industry is very fragmented, with approximately 50% of United States screens owned by the three largest theatre circuits and the other 50% owned by approximately 800 smaller operators, making it very difficult to predict when acquisition opportunities may arise. We have engaged third-party assistance to actively help us seek additional potential acquisitions in the future. We do not believe that we are geographically constrained, and we believe that we may be able to add value to certain theatres through our various proprietary amenities and operating expertise.
 
DreamLounger recliner additions. These luxurious, state-of-the-art recliners allow guests to go from upright to a full-recline position in seconds. These seat changes require full auditorium remodels to accommodate the necessary 84 inches of legroom, resulting in the loss of approximately 50% of the existing traditional seats in an average auditorium. To date, the addition of DreamLoungers has significantly increased attendance at each of our applicable theatres, outperforming nearby competitive theatres as well as growing the overall market attendance in most cases. We added DreamLounger recliner seats to seven more theatres during fiscal 2016. As a result, as of December 29, 2016, we offered all DreamLounger recliner seating in 21 theatres, representing approximately 42% of our company-owned, first-run theatres (excluding the newly-acquired Wehrenberg theatres). Including our premium, large format (PLF) auditoriums with recliner seating, as of December 29, 2016, we offered our DreamLounger recliner seating in approximately 48% of our company-owned, first-run screens (excluding the Wehrenberg screens), a percentage we believe to be the highest among the largest theatre chains in the nation. Currently, only one Wehrenberg theatre offers recliner seating in all of its auditoriums. We are currently evaluating opportunities to add our DreamLounger premium seating to 12 to 18 additional theatres during fiscal 2017, including multiple Wehrenberg theatres, in addition to the two new fiscal 2017 theatres described above. The majority of these projects are expected to be completed during the second half of fiscal 2017, but it is certainly possible that several may carry over into fiscal 2018. As a result, by the end of fiscal 2017 or shortly thereafter, we may increase our percentage of total combined Marcus/Wehrenberg theatres with all-DreamLounger recliner seating to approximately 55-65% and our percentage of total combined Marcus/Wehrenberg company-owned, first-run screens with DreamLounger recliner seating to 60-70%.
 
UltraScreen DLX and SuperScreen DLX (DreamLounger eXperience) conversions. We introduced one of the first PLF presentations to the industry when we rolled out our proprietary UltraScreen® concept in 1999. During fiscal 2014, we introduced our UltraScreen DLX concept by combining our premium, large-format presentation with DreamLounger recliner seating and Dolby® Atmos™ immersive sound to elevate the movie-going experience for our guests. During the Transition Period, we completed the renovation of 17 existing screens into PLF auditoriums. During fiscal 2016, we opened two new UltraScreen DLX auditoriums at an existing theatre in Minnesota, completed conversion of one UltraScreen to an UltraScreen DLX at an existing theatre in Illinois, opened one new UltraScreen DLX auditorium and two new SuperScreen DLX auditoriums at our new Country Club Hills theatre described above, and converted four additional screens to SuperScreen DLX auditoriums at three existing theatres in Wisconsin and Illinois. Several of our new PLF screens in fiscal 2016 included the added feature of heated DreamLounger recliner seats. As of December 29, 2016, we had 23 UltraScreen DLX auditoriums, three traditional UltraScreens and 25 SuperScreen DLX auditoriums (slightly smaller screen than an UltraScreen but with the same DreamLounger seating and Dolby Atmos sound – a PLF presentation designed for smaller markets) at our theatre locations (excluding the recently acquired Wehrenberg theatres). We currently offer at least one PLF screen in approximately 64% of our first-run, company-owned theatres (excluding the recently acquired Wehrenberg theatres) – once again a percentage we believe to be the highest percentage among the largest theatre chains in the nation. Three of the recently acquired Wehrenberg theatres feature IMAX® PLF screens. One Wehrenberg theatre features a proprietary MegaScreen PLF screen that we expect to convert to an UltraScreen DLX auditorium during fiscal 2017. Our PLF screens generally have higher per-screen revenues and draw customers from a larger geographic region compared to our standard screens, and we charge a premium price to our guests for this experience. We are currently evaluating opportunities to convert up to eight additional screens at six existing theatres, including multiple Wehrenberg theatres, to UltraScreen DLX and SuperScreen DLX auditoriums during fiscal 2017, in addition to three new PLF auditoriums planned for the two new fiscal 2017 theatres described above.
