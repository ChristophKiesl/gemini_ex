Item 1.  Business
OVERVIEW

Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless context requires otherwise, “Helix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in 1979 and in 1983 was re-incorporated in the state of Minnesota. We are an international offshore energy services company that provides specialty services to the offshore energy industry, with a focus on well intervention and robotics operations. We seek to provide services and methodologies that we believe are critical to maximizing production economics. We provide services primarily in deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions, and are expanding our operations offshore Brazil. Our “life of field” services are segregated into three reportable business segments: Well Intervention, Robotics and Production Facilities. For additional information regarding our strategy and business operations, see sections titled “Our Strategy” and “Our Operations” included elsewhere within Item 1. Business of this Annual Report.

Our principal executive offices are located at 3505 West Sam Houston Parkway North, Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77043; our phone number is 281-618-0400. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “HLX.” Our Chief Executive Officer submitted the annual CEO certification to the NYSE as required under its Listed Company Manual in June 2016. Our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have made the certifications required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report.

Please refer to the subsection “— Certain Definitions” on page 14 for definitions of additional terms commonly used in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise indicated any reference to Notes herein refers to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data located elsewhere in this Annual Report.

OUR STRATEGY

Our focus is on our well intervention and robotics businesses. We believe that focusing on these services will deliver favorable long-term financial returns. From time to time, we make strategic investments that expand our service capabilities or add capacity to existing services in our key operating regions. The long-term prospects of our well intervention fleet are enhanced by the delivery of the Siem Helix 1 chartered vessel in June 2016, the delivery of the Siem Helix 2 chartered vessel in February 2017 and the completion and delivery of the Q7000, a newbuild semi-submersible vessel, in 2018. Chartering newer vessels with additional capabilities, including the Grand Canyon III chartered vessel which is expected to be in service for us in May 2017, should enable our robotics business to better serve the needs of our customers. It also is beneficial to us from a long-term perspective to have secured our new fixed fee agreement for the Helix Producer I (the “HP I”), a dynamic positioning floating production vessel, to continue to service the Phoenix field for the field operator until at least June 1, 2023.

In January 2015, Helix, OneSubsea LLC, OneSubsea B.V., Schlumberger Technology Corporation, Schlumberger B.V. and Schlumberger Oilfield Holdings Ltd. entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement and related agreements for the parties’ strategic alliance to design, develop, manufacture, promote, market and sell on a global basis integrated equipment and services for subsea well intervention. The alliance is expected to leverage the parties’ capabilities to provide a unique, fully integrated offering to clients, combining marine support with well access and control technologies. In April 2015, we and OneSubsea agreed to jointly develop and ordered a 15,000 working p.s.i. intervention riser system (“IRS”), which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017 for a total cost of approximately $28 million (approximately $14 million for our 50% interest). At December 31, 2016, our total investment in the IRS was $6.5 million. In October 2016, we and OneSubsea launched the development of our first Riserless Open-water Abandonment Module (“ROAM”) for an estimated cost of approximately $12 million (approximately $6 million for our 50% interest), almost all of which will be incurred in 2017. The ROAM is expected to be available to customers in the third quarter of 2017.

OUR OPERATIONS

We have three reportable business segments: Well Intervention, Robotics and Production Facilities. We provide a full range of services primarily in deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions, and are expanding our operations offshore Brazil. Our Well Intervention segment includes our vessels and equipment used to perform well intervention services primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and Brazil. Our well intervention vessels include the Q4000, the Q5000, the Seawell, the Well Enhancer, and the chartered Skandi Constructor, Siem Helix 1 and Siem Helix 2 vessels. We previously owned the Helix 534, which we sold in December 2016. Our Well Intervention segment also includes IRSs, some of which we rent out on a stand-alone basis, and subsea intervention lubricators (“SILs”). Our Robotics segment includes remotely operated vehicles (“ROVs”), trenchers and ROVDrills designed to complement offshore construction and well intervention services, and currently operates three chartered ROV support vessels. Our Production Facilities segment includes the HP I, the Helix Fast Response System (the “HFRS”) and our investment in Independence Hub, LLC (“Independence Hub”), and previously included our former ownership interest in Deepwater Gateway, L.L.C. (“Deepwater Gateway”) that we sold in February 2016. All of our production facilities activities are located in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 13 for financial results related to our business segments. Our current services include:

• | Production. Well intervention; intervention engineering; production enhancement; inspection, repair and maintenance of production structures, trees, jumpers, risers, pipelines and subsea equipment; and life of field support. 


• | Reclamation. Reclamation and remediation services; well plugging and abandonment services; pipeline abandonment services; and site inspections. 


• | Development. Installation of flowlines, control umbilicals, manifold assemblies and risers; trenching and burial of pipelines; installation and tie-in of riser and manifold assembly; commissioning, testing and inspection; and cable and umbilical lay and connection. We have experienced increased demand for our services from the alternative energy industry. Some of the services we provide to these alternative energy businesses include subsea power cable installation, trenching and burial, along with seabed coring and preparation for construction of wind turbine foundations. 


• | Production facilities. Provision of oil and natural gas processing facilities and services to oil and gas companies operating in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, using our HP I vessel. Currently, the HP I is being utilized to process production from the Phoenix field. 


• | Fast Response System. Provision of the HFRS as a response resource that can be identified in permit applications to federal and state agencies and respond in the event of a well control incident. 

Well Intervention

We engineer, manage and conduct well construction, intervention and abandonment operations in water depths ranging from 200 to 10,000 feet. As major and independent oil and gas companies conduct operations in the deepwater basins of the world, development of these reserves will often require the installation of subsea trees. Historically, drilling rigs were typically necessary for subsea well intervention to troubleshoot or enhance production, shift sleeves, log wells or perform recompletions. Our well intervention vessels serve as work platforms for well intervention services at costs that historically have been less than offshore drilling rigs. Competitive advantages of our vessels are derived from their lower operating costs, together with an ability to mobilize quickly and to maximize operational time by performing a broad range of tasks related to intervention, construction, inspection, repair and maintenance. These services provide a cost advantage in the development and management of subsea reservoirs. Over time, we expect long-term demand for well intervention services to increase due to the growing number of subsea tree installations and the efficiency gains from specialized intervention assets and equipment.

In the Gulf of Mexico, our multi-service semi-submersible vessel, the Q4000, has set a series of well intervention “firsts” in increasingly deeper water without the use of a traditional drilling rig. In 2010, the Q4000 served as a key emergency response vessel in the Macondo well control and containment efforts. The Q4000 also serves an important role in the HFRS that was originally established in 2011. In April 2015, we took delivery of the Q5000, a newbuild semi-submersible well intervention vessel. The Q5000 commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico during the fourth quarter of 2015. The vessel went on contracted rates in May 2016 under our five-year contract with BP. We previously owned the Helix 534, which we sold in December 2016.

In the North Sea, the Well Enhancer has performed well intervention, abandonment and coil tubing services since it joined our fleet in the North Sea region in 2009. The Seawell has provided well intervention and abandonment services since 1987. The vessel underwent major capital upgrades in 2015 to extend its estimated useful economic life by approximately 15 years. The chartered Skandi Constructor has been performing well intervention services for us in the North Sea since September 2013. In September 2015, we extended the charter through April 1, 2017. The vessel has been stacked at reduced charter rates since November 2015 with the exception of a two-week project during the third quarter of 2016. We currently plan on returning the vessel to its owner when the vessel charter expires on April 1, 2017.

In September 2013, we executed a contract with the same shipyard in Singapore that constructed the Q5000. This contract is for the construction of a newbuild semi-submersible well intervention vessel, the Q7000, which is being built to North Sea standards. This $346 million shipyard contract represents the majority of the expected costs associated with the construction of the Q7000. Pursuant to the terms of this contract and subsequent amendments, 20% of the contract price was paid upon the signing of the contract. The remaining 80% is to be paid in three installments, with 20% in June 2016 (payment was made in October 2016 as agreed between the parties), 20% upon issuance of the Completion Certificate, which is to be issued on or before December 31, 2017, and 40% upon the delivery of the vessel, which at our option can be deferred until December 30, 2018.

In February 2014, we entered into agreements with Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”) to provide well intervention services offshore Brazil, and in connection with the Petrobras agreements, we entered into charter agreements with Siem Offshore AS (“Siem”) for two newbuild monohull vessels, the Siem Helix 1 and the Siem Helix 2. The initial term of the charter agreements with Siem is for seven years from the respective vessel delivery dates with options to extend. The initial term of the agreements with Petrobras is for four years with Petrobras’s options to extend. As part of Petrobras’s efforts to reduce its costs structure with many of its suppliers, we and Petrobras began discussions in mid-2015 with respect to potentially amending our contracts in a manner that addressed Petrobras’s objectives and was acceptable to us as well. Those negotiations were finalized in early June 2016 such that the contracts for the Siem Helix 1, originally scheduled to begin no later than July 22, 2016, were amended to commence between July 22, 2016 and October 21, 2016, with the day rate reduced to a mutually acceptable level, and the contracts for the Siem Helix 2, originally scheduled to begin no later than January 21, 2017, were amended to commence between October 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, with no change in the day rate. The Siem Helix 1 is continuing to work through Petrobras’s inspection and acceptance process, including the completion of modifications as agreed between us and Petrobras. Our current expectation is that the vessel will commence operations before the end of the first quarter of 2017. The Siem Helix 2 was delivered to us on February 10, 2017 and is currently undergoing integration and commissioning of our topside equipment onboard. We anticipate that the vessel will commence services for Petrobras in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Robotics

We have been actively engaged in robotics for over three decades. We operate ROVs, trenchers and ROVDrills designed for offshore construction, maintenance and well intervention services. As global marine construction support operates in deeper waters, the use of ROV systems has increased and the scope of ROV services has become essential to deep water operations. Our chartered vessels add value by supporting deployment of our ROVs and trenchers. We provide our customers with vessel availability and schedule flexibility to meet the technological challenges of their subsea activities worldwide. Our robotics assets include 52 ROVs, five trenching systems and two ROVDrills. Our robotics business unit primarily operates in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, West Africa and Asia Pacific regions. We currently charter vessels on a long-term basis to support our robotics operations and we have historically engaged spot vessels on short-term charter agreements as needed. Vessels currently under long-term charter agreements include the Deep Cygnus, the Grand Canyon and the Grand Canyon II. We also have entered into a long-term charter agreement for the Grand Canyon III, which is scheduled for delivery to us in May 2017. We returned the Rem Installer to its owner as the charter expired in July 2016.

Over the last decade there has been an increase in offshore activity associated with the growing alternative (renewable) energy industry. Specifically there has been an increase in services performed for the offshore wind farm industry. As the level of activity for offshore alternative energy projects has increased, so has the need for reliable services and related equipment. Historically, this work was performed with the use of barges and other similar vessels, but these types of services are now being contracted to vessels such as our Deep Cygnus and Grand Canyon chartered vessels that are suitable for harsh weather conditions that can occur offshore, especially in northern Europe where offshore wind farming is currently concentrated. In 2016, revenues derived from offshore renewables contracts accounted for 14% of our global robotics revenues. We believe that over the long term our robotics business unit is positioned to continue the services it provides to a range of clients in the alternative energy business. This is expected to include the use of our chartered vessels, ROVs and trenchers to provide burial services relating to subsea power cable installations on key wind farm developments.

Production Facilities

We own the HP I, a ship-shaped dynamic positioning floating production vessel capable of processing up to 45,000 barrels of oil and 80 million cubic feet (“MMcf”) of natural gas per day. The HP I was previously contracted to process production from the Phoenix field for the field operator until at least December 31, 2017, and in July 2016 we entered into a new fixed fee agreement for the HP I with the same operator, effective June 1, 2016, for service to the Phoenix field until at least June 1, 2023.

We own a 20% interest in Independence Hub, which owns the Independence Hub platform located in 8,000 feet of water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. We previously owned a 50% interest in Deepwater Gateway, which owns the Marco Polo TLP located in 4,300 feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico. In February 2016, we sold our ownership interest in Deepwater Gateway for $25 million.

We developed the HFRS as a culmination of our experience as a responder in the 2010 Macondo well control and containment efforts. The HFRS centers on two of our vessels, the HP I and the Q4000, both of which played a key role in the Macondo well control and containment efforts and are currently operating in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2011, we signed an agreement with Clean Gulf Associates (“CGA”), a non-profit industry group, allowing, in exchange for a retainer fee, the HFRS to be named as a response resource in permit applications to federal and state agencies and making the HFRS available to certain CGA participants who executed utilization agreements with us that specified the day rates to be charged should the HFRS be deployed in connection with a well control incident. The original set of agreements expired on March 31, 2013, and we entered into a new set of substantially similar agreements, effective April 1, 2013, with the operators who formed HWCG LLC, a Delaware limited liability company comprised of some of the original CGA members as well as other industry participants, to perform the same functions as CGA with respect to the HFRS. In March 2015, HWCG LLC exercised an option to extend the agreement with us through March 31, 2018.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

We primarily operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions. We are also expanding our operations offshore Brazil. See Note 13 for revenues as well as property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, by geographic areas.
CUSTOMERS

Our customers include major and independent oil and gas producers and suppliers, pipeline transmission companies, alternative (renewable) energy companies and offshore engineering and construction firms. The level of services required by any particular customer depends, in part, on the size of that customer’s capital expenditure budget in a particular year. Consequently, customers that account for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in subsequent fiscal years. The percent of consolidated revenues from major customers, those whose total represented 10% or more of our consolidated revenues is as follows: 2016 — BP (17%) and Shell (11%), 2015 — Shell (16%) and Talos (11%) and 2014 — Anadarko (13%). We provided services to over 45 customers in 2016.

COMPETITION

The oilfield services industry is highly competitive. While price is a factor, the ability to access specialized vessels, attract and retain skilled personnel, and demonstrate a good safety record is also important. Our principal competitors in the well intervention business include Island Offshore and international drilling contractors. Our principal competitors in the robotics business include C-Innovation, LLC, DeepOcean Group, DOF Subsea Group, Fugro N.V. and Oceaneering International, Inc. Our competitors may have significantly more financial, personnel, technological and other resources available to them.
TRAINING, SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

Our corporate vision is based on the belief that all incidents should be preventable. Helix strives to achieve this by focusing on controlling major hazard risks and managing behavior. We have established a corporate culture in which QHSE has equal priority to our other business objectives. Should QHSE be in conflict with business objectives, then QHSE will take priority. Everyone at Helix has the authority and the duty to “STOP WORK” they believe is unsafe.

Our QHSE management systems and training programs were developed by management personnel based on common industry work practices and by employees with on-site experience who understand the risk and physical challenges of the ocean work site. As a result, we believe that our QHSE programs are among the best in the industry. We maintain a company-wide effort to continuously improve our control of QHSE risks and the behavior of our employees.

The process includes the assessment of risk through the use of selected risk analysis tools, control of work through management system procedures, job risk assessment of all routine and non-routine tasks, documentation of all daily observations, collection of data and data treatment to provide the mechanism for understanding our QHSE risks and at-risk behaviors. In addition, we schedule hazard hunts on each vessel and regularly audit QHSE management systems; both are completed with assigned responsibilities and action due dates.

The management systems of our well intervention and robotics business units have been independently assessed and registered compliant to ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems). All of our safety management systems are created in accordance with and conform to OHSAS 18001.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Overview

Many aspects of the offshore marine construction industry are subject to extensive governmental regulations. We are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard (the “Coast Guard”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), three divisions of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the “BOEM”), the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (the “BSEE”), and the Office of Natural Resource Revenue (the “ONRR”), and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the “CBP”) as well as classification societies such as the American Bureau of Shipping (the “ABS”). We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety for our land-based operations.

In the North Sea, international regulations govern working hours and a specified working environment, as well as standards for diving procedures, equipment and diver health. These North Sea standards are some of the most stringent worldwide. In the absence of any specific regulation, our North Sea operations adhere to standards set by the International Marine Contractors Association and the International Maritime Organization. In addition, we operate in other foreign jurisdictions each with their own laws and regulations to which we are subject.

With respect to North Sea operations, we also note that the U.K.’s 2016 decision to exit from the EU may result in the imposition of new laws, rules or regulations affecting operations inside U.K. territorial waters.

8

Coast Guard

The Coast Guard sets safety standards and is authorized to investigate vessel and diving accidents as well as other marine casualty incidents and to recommend improved safety standards. The Coast Guard is also authorized to inspect vessels at will. We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain various permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations.
BOEM and BSEE

The development and operation of oil and gas properties located on the Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) of the United States is regulated primarily by the BOEM and BSEE. Among other requirements, the BOEM requires lessees of OCS properties to post bonds or provide other adequate financial assurance in connection with the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities. As a service company, we are not subject to these regulations, but do depend on the demand for our services from the oil and gas industry, and therefore, our business is affected by laws and regulations, as well as changing tax laws and policies, relating to the oil and gas industry in general.

The Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010 resulted in enhanced standards being implemented for companies engaged in the development of offshore oil and gas wells. These standards are determined and implemented by BSEE. The applicable standards now include Notice to Lessees (NTL), NTL 2010-N06 (Environmental NTL), NTL 2010-N10 (Compliance and Evaluation NTL), NTL 2013-N02 (Significant Change to Oil Spill Response Plan Worst Case Scenario), the Final Drilling Safety Rule, and a rule regarding Production Measurement Documents.

On April 17, 2015, the BSEE announced its new proposed blowout preventer and well control requirements rule for the OCS federal waters, 30 C.F.R. Part 250. Several years in the making, the proposed rule aims to enhance well control and equipment reliability, and includes a suite of reforms in well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time well monitoring, and subsea containment.

Finalization of the “Well Control Rule” in 2016 resulted in reforms that establish (phased in over time) the following items: (1) incorporation of the latest industry standards that establish minimum baseline requirements for the design, manufacture, repair, and maintenance of blowout preventers (BOPs); (2) additional controls over the maintenance and repair of BOPs; (3) use of dual shear rams in Deepwater BOPs; (4) requirement that BOP systems include a technology that allows the drill pipe to be centered during shearing operations; (5) more rigorous third party certification of the shearing capability of BOPs; (6) expanded accumulator capacity and operational capabilities for increased functionality; (7) real-time monitoring capability for deep-water and high-temperature/high-pressure drilling activities; (8) establishment by regulation of criteria for the testing and inspection of subsea well containment equipment; (9) increased reporting of BOP failure data to the BSEE and the Original Equipment Manufacturers; (10) expectations of what constitutes a safe drilling margin and allowance for alternative safe drilling margins when justified; (11) requirements for the use of accepted engineering principles and establishment of general performance criteria for drilling and completion equipment; (12) establishment of additional requirements for using ROVs to function certain components on the BOP stack; (13) requirements for adequate centralization of casing during cementing; and (14) making the testing frequency of BOPs used on workover and decommissioning operations the same as drilling operations.

The Well Control Rule further provides guidance for the design and operation of remotely operated tools including ROV tooling used on offshore subsea systems are to be held to the industry standards incorporated in API 17H, First Edition.

The Jones Act (Coastwise Trade Rules)

We are also subject to the Merchant Marine Act (commonly known as “the Jones Act”), which regulates the kind of vessels that can carry goods between ports of the U.S. and which has been applied to offshore oil and gas work in the U.S. The Jones Act is interpreted in large part by letter rulings of the CBP. The cumulative effect of these letter rulings has been to establish a framework for offshore operators to understand when an operation can be carried out by a foreign flag vessel and when it must be carried out by a coastwise qualified U.S. flag vessel.

9

In January 2017, the CBP and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), initiated a proposed modification and revocation of certain letter rulings previously issued by the CBP, subject to public comment by April 18, 2017. The proposed rulemaking would largely reverse the holdings of years of letter rulings from the CBP regarding the application of the Jones Act to offshore oil and gas work. The ramifications of the proposed modification and revocation of prior letter rulings is currently uncertain; however if such proposal is adopted, this development could potentially make it more difficult and/or costly to perform our offshore services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

Other Federal and State Regulatory Agencies

Additional proposals and proceedings before various federal and state regulatory agencies and the courts could affect the oil and gas industry. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective.

These regulatory developments and legislative initiatives may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Overview

Our operations are subject to a variety of national (including federal, state and local) and international laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce these laws that are often complex, costly to comply with, and carry substantial administrative, civil and possibly criminal penalties for failure to comply.

Under these laws and regulations, we may be liable for remediation or removal costs, damages and other costs associated with releases of hazardous materials (including oil) into the environment, and that liability may be imposed on us even if the acts that resulted in the releases were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.

OPA 90

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”), imposes a variety of requirements on “Responsible Parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. A “Responsible Party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, a vessel or a pipeline, and the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA imposes liability on each Responsible Party for oil spill removal costs and for other public and private damages from oil spills. Failure to comply with OPA may result in the assessment of civil and criminal penalties. OPA establishes liability limits equal to the greater of $939,800 or $1,100 per gross ton (effective December 21, 2015) for vessels other than tankers. Liability limits are higher for other types of facilities and could apply if our operations resulted in Responsible Party status for a spill from such a facility. The liability limits are not applicable, however, (i) if the spill is caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) if the spill results from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or (iii) if a party fails to report a spill or fails to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed under OPA.

In addition, OPA requires owners and operators of vessels over 300 gross tons to provide the Coast Guard with evidence of financial responsibility to cover the cost of cleaning up oil spills from such vessels. We currently own and operate six vessels over 300 gross tons. We have provided satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility to the Coast Guard for all of our vessels.

10

Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act imposes strict controls on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States and imposes potential liability for the costs of remediating releases of petroleum and other substances. The controls and restrictions imposed under the Clean Water Act have become more stringent over time, and it is possible that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the exploration for, and production of, oil and natural gas into certain coastal and offshore waters.

The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharge of oil and other hazardous substances and imposes liability on Responsible Parties for the costs of cleaning up any environmental contamination caused by the release of a hazardous substance and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. Many states have laws that are analogous to the Clean Water Act and also require remediation of releases of petroleum and other hazardous substances in state waters. Our vessels carry diesel fuel for their own use. Offshore facilities and vessels operated by us have facility and vessel response plans to deal with potential spills. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and state statutes enacted to control water pollution.

Clean Air Act

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that greenhouse gasses are an air pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act and thus subject to regulation by the EPA. In October 2009, the EPA published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas sources in the United States on an annual basis, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA expanded its greenhouse reporting rule to include onshore petroleum and natural gas production, offshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas processing, natural gas transmission, underground natural gas storage, liquefied natural gas storage, liquefied natural gas import and export, and natural gas distribution facilities. As of 2011, reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis under this expanded rule.

A variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives have been introduced in the domestic and international regions in which we operate that are focused on restricting the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. For example, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and almost one-half of the states already have taken legal measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. More stringent regulations under the Clean Air Act or other similar federal or state law could materially impact our business.

CERCLA

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) contains provisions requiring the remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons including owners and operators of contaminated sites where the release occurred and those companies that transport, dispose of or arrange for disposal of hazardous substances released at the sites. Under CERCLA, those persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. Third parties may also file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances.

We operate in foreign jurisdictions that have various types of governmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of oil or hazardous substances and the protection of the environment. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we could be held liable for remediation of some types of pollution, including the release of oil, hazardous substances and debris from production, refining or industrial facilities, as well as other assets we own or operate or that are owned or operated by our customers or our subcontractors.

11

OCSLA

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (“OCSLA”), provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the production of offshore resources of oil and natural gas, including authority to impose safety and environmental protection requirements applicable to lessees and permittees operating in the OCS. Specific design and operational standards may apply to OCS vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and cancellation of leases. Because our operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production, if the government were to exercise its authority under OCSLA to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases, such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Equally important, since August 2012, the agency has implemented policy guidelines (IPD No. 12-07) under which BSEE will issue incidents of noncompliance directly to contractors for serious violations of BSEE regulations.
MARPOL

The United States is one of approximately 170 member countries to the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), a specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. The IMO has negotiated the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”). MARPOL imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry, to which we are subject. These standards relate to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and air emissions.
Greenhouse Gases and Vessel Engine Emissions

Greenhouse gases and marine engine emissions are an area of increasing regulatory action. We may be subject to a variety of regulations from multiple regulatory bodies that are designed to reduce greenhouse gases or other particulate emissions, including restrictions on the types of fuels used on our vessels, restrictions on the types of engines, carbon neutralization or offset measures and/or requirements to collect and report data on emissions and the costs attendant to each of these efforts.

In the U.S., the EPA regulates the standards for emissions from vessel engines, both on its own and as a participant in the IMO. Beginning in 2010, the IMO designated the waters off North American as an Emission Control Area. Directives have been issued designed to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. These can impact both the fuel and the engines that may be used onboard vessels. In addition, U.S. States can (and in the case of California, have) issue rules regulating emissions from vessels operating off their coasts. In 2016, the California Air Resources Board notified the industry that their vessel fuel regulations would not sunset due to the implementation by the IMO of the emissions regulations in the North American Emission Control Area, but would continue in effect (Marine Notice 2016-1).

In addition, foreign nations and state actors may also impose emissions restrictions. The EU has issued regulations (EU Regulation 2015/757) that requires monitoring and reporting of the emissions of vessels exceeding 5,000 gross tons that call at EU ports, with the first reports due in 2019. At present the regulation is for monitoring and reporting only. But it is anticipated that in the future the EU may move from requiring reporting of emissions to regulations aimed at reducing them.

Current Compliance and Potential Material Impact

We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject. We do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, changes in the environmental laws and regulations, or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, and thus there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future. Such environmental liability could substantially reduce our net income and could have a significant impact on our financial ability to carry out our operations.

INSURANCE MATTERS

Our businesses involve a high degree of operational risk. Hazards, such as vessels sinking, grounding, colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions, are inherent in marine operations. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and the suspension of operations. Damages arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits asserting large claims. Insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

As discussed below, we maintain insurance policies to cover some of our risk of loss associated with our operations. We maintain the amount of insurance we believe is prudent based on our estimated loss potential. However, not all of our business activities can be insured at the levels we desire because of either limited market availability or unfavorable economics (limited coverage considering the underlying cost).

Our current insurance program was renewed on July 1, 2016 and is valid until June 30, 2018.

We maintain Hull and Increased Value insurance, which provides coverage for physical damage up to an agreed amount for each vessel. The deductibles are $1.0 million on the Q4000, the Q5000, the HP I and the Well Enhancer, and $500,000 on the Seawell. In addition to the primary deductibles, the vessels are subject to an annual aggregate deductible of $5 million. We also carry Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) insurance, which covers liabilities arising from the operation of the vessels, and General Liability insurance, which covers liabilities arising from construction operations. The deductible on both the P&I and General Liability is $100,000 per occurrence. Onshore employees are covered by Workers’ Compensation. Offshore employees and marine crews are covered by a Maritime Employers Liability (“MEL”) insurance policy, which covers Jones Act exposures, and includes a deductible of $100,000 per occurrence plus a $750,000 annual aggregate deductible. In addition to the liability policies described above, we currently carry various layers of Umbrella Liability for total limits of $500 million in excess of primary limits. Our self-insured retention on our medical and health benefits program for employees is $250,000 per participant.

We also maintain Operator Extra Expense coverage that provides up to $150 million of coverage per each loss occurrence for a well control issue. Separately, we also maintain $500 million of liability insurance and $150 million of oil pollution insurance. For any given oil spill event we have up to $650 million of insurance coverage.

We customarily have agreements with our customers and vendors in which each contracting party is responsible for its respective personnel. Under these agreements we are indemnified against third party claims related to the injury or death of our customers’ or vendors’ personnel, and vice versa. With respect to well work contracted to us, the customer is generally contractually responsible for pollution emanating from the well. We separately maintain additional coverage for an amount up to $100 million that would cover us under certain circumstances against any such third party claims associated with well control events.

We incur workers’ compensation, MEL and other insurance claims in the normal course of business, which we believe are covered by insurance. We analyze each claim for potential exposure and estimate the ultimate liability of each claim. In January 2017, we settled an ongoing claim in an amount that exceeded our deductible and the excess was covered by insurance. We have not incurred any significant losses as a result of claims denied by our insurance carriers. Our services are provided in hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could occur, and litigation arising from such an event may result in our being named a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. Although there can be no assurance the amount of insurance we carry is sufficient to protect us fully in all events, or that such insurance will continue to be available at current levels of cost or coverage, we believe that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,474 employees, of which 574 were salaried personnel. Our U.S. employees do not belong to a union nor are they employed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or any similar arrangement. We believe that our overall relationships with our employees are favorable.

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

Defined below are certain terms helpful to understanding our business that are located through this Annual Report:

BOEM:   The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) is responsible for managing environmentally and economically responsible development of the U.S. offshore resources. Its functions include offshore leasing, resource evaluation, review and administration of oil and gas exploration and development plans, renewable energy development, National Environmental Policy Act analysis and environmental studies.

BSEE:   The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) is responsible for safety and environmental oversight of offshore oil and gas operations, including permitting and inspections of offshore oil and gas operations. Its functions include the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations, permitting offshore exploration, development and production, inspections, offshore regulatory programs, oil spill response and newly formed training and environmental compliance programs.

Deepwater:  Water depths exceeding 1,000 feet.

Dynamic Positioning (DP):  Computer directed thruster systems that use satellite based positioning and other positioning technologies to ensure the proper counteraction to wind, current and wave forces enabling a vessel to maintain its position without the use of anchors.

DP2:  Two DP systems on a single vessel providing the redundancy that allows the vessel to maintain position even with the failure of one DP system.

DP3:  Triple-redundant DP control system comprising a triple-redundant controller unit and three identical operator stations. The system has to withstand fire or flood in any one compartment without the system failing. Loss of position should not occur from any single failure, including a completely burnt fire subdivision or flooded watertight compartment.

14

Intervention Riser System (IRS):  A subsea system that establishes a direct connection from a well intervention vessel, through a rigid riser, to a conventional or horizontal subsea tree in depths up to 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). The system can be utilized for wireline intervention, production logging, coiled-tubing operations, well stimulation, and full plug and abandonment operations. The system provides the well control in order to safely access the well bore for these activities.

Life of Field Services:  Services performed on offshore facilities, trees and pipelines from the beginning to the end of the economic life of an oil field, including installation, inspection, maintenance, repair, well intervention and abandonment.

QHSE:  Quality, Health, Safety and Environmental programs to protect the environment, safeguard employee health and avoid injuries.

Pound Per Square Inch (p.s.i.):  A unit of measurement for pressure or stress resulting from a force of one pound-force applied to an area of one square inch.
