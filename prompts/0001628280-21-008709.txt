Item 1.    BUSINESS
Our Company

Strategic Overview

Teligent, Inc. (the “Company”) is a generic pharmaceutical company. All references to "Teligent," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Teligent, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Our mission is to become a leader in high-barrier to entry generic pharmaceuticals. Our platform for growth is centered around the development, manufacturing and marketing of a portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products under our own label and private labeled for other pharmaceutical companies in topical, injectable and other high-barrier dosage forms. We believe that expanding our development and commercial base beyond topical generics, historically the cornerstone of our expertise, to include injectable generics and other high-barrier generics, will leverage our existing expertise and capabilities, and broaden our platform for more diversified strategic growth.
We currently market and sell generic topical and generic and branded generic injectable pharmaceutical products in the United States and Canada. In the United States, we market 37 generic topical pharmaceutical products and two branded injectable pharmaceutical products. We have received FDA approvals for 36 topical generic products from our internally developed pipeline and we have seven Abbreviated New Drug Applications, ("ANDAs") and three New Drug Application ("NDA") Prior Approval Supplements ("PASs") submitted to the FDA that are awaiting approval. In Canada, we market 25 generic injectable, three generic topical, and three generic ophthalmic products. We have one Abbreviated New Drug Submission (“ANDS”) pending at Health Canada. In the United States, approved ANDA generic drugs are usually interchangeable with the innovator drug. This means that the generic version may generally be substituted for the branded product by either a physician or pharmacist when dispensing a prescription. We also provide contract development and manufacturing services to the prescription and over-the-counter ("OTC") pharmaceutical and cosmetic markets. We operate our business under one operating segment. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “TLGT.” Our principal executive office, laboratories and manufacturing facilities are located at 105 Lincoln Avenue, Buena, New Jersey. We have additional offices located in Iselin, New Jersey, and Mississauga, Canada. In late 2020, we decided to reposition the research and development operation mainly performed at our Tallinn, Estonia office to our US manufacturing site at Buena, New Jersey and consequently we are in the process of working to dissolve our Estonia operations.
The manufacturing and commercialization of generic pharmaceutical products is competitive, and there are established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors actively engaged in all phases of our business. We currently manufacture and sell topical, injectable and ophthalmic generic pharmaceutical products under our own label in both the US and Canada.
In the United States, the three large wholesale drug distributors are AmerisourceBergen Corporation ("ABC"); Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal"); and McKesson Drug Company, ("McKesson"). ABC, Cardinal and McKesson are key distributors of our products, as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies. None of these distributors is an end user of our products. Generally, if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease, we believe that the end users of our products would likely find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor. However, the loss of one or more of these distributors, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. There are generally three major negotiating entities in the US market. Walgreens Boots Alliance Development (WBAD) consists of Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen's PRxO Generics program. Red Oak Sourcing consists of CVS and Cardinal’s source programs. Finally, ClarusOne consists of Walmart, RiteAid and McKesson’s OneStop program. A loss of any of these major entities could result in a significant reduction in revenue.
We consider our business relationships with ABC, Cardinal and McKesson to be in good standing and we have fee for services contracts with each of them. However, a change in purchasing patterns, a decrease in inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to explore business development opportunities to add additional products and/or capabilities to our existing portfolio and to expand our private label and contract manufacturing service opportunities.
We have two platforms for growth:

•Developing, manufacturing and marketing a portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products under our own or a private label in topical, injectable and other high-barrier forms; and
•Managing and expanding our current private label and contract development and manufacturing business.
Since 2010, the primary focus of our strategy has been on the growth of our own generic prescription pharmaceutical business particularly within the generic topical pharmaceutical product market, while moderating our contract development and manufacturing to the prescription and OTC pharmaceutical and cosmetic markets. In 2014, we broadened our primary target product focus from topical pharmaceuticals to include a wider approach focused on high-barrier generic prescription pharmaceutical products and generic and branded generic injectable pharmaceutical products. We believed that expanding our development and commercial base beyond topical generics, historically the cornerstone of our expertise, to include injectable generics and other high-barrier dosage forms would leverage our existing expertise and capabilities, and broaden our platform for diversified strategic growth. While we experienced some success in that regard, during the last year, as we have experienced the unfavorable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have begun to reexamine all of our expertise and assets in order to reinvigorate and bolster our business. This has resulted in our placing additional emphasis on the development of our private label business as well as our contract development and manufacturing business.
Following five approvals from our internally developed pipeline of topical generic products in 2019, there were no approvals from our internally developed pipeline of topical generic products in 2020. We continue to be opportunistic in efforts to license or acquire further products, intellectual property, or pending applications to expand our portfolio. We expect to accelerate our growth through the creation of unique opportunities based on the acquisition of additional intellectual property and/or the expansion of the use of our existing intellectual property. We are also exploring the options to monetize certain of our non-core assets.
Based on IQVIA (NYSE: IQV) data, the addressable market for the seven ANDA topical filings and three NDAs that we have pending with the FDA is estimated to total over $140 million per annum. We expect to continue to expand our presence in the generic topical and generic injectable pharmaceutical markets through the submission of additional ANDAs to the FDA and the subsequent launch of products if and when these applications are approved by the FDA. 
Facility Expansion. We completed the first phase of our facility expansion in July 2016, with the complete interior renovation of our building at 101 Lincoln Avenue in Buena, New Jersey. This building now houses our new product development laboratory for work on topical and sterile pharmaceuticals. This laboratory integrates our formulation and analytical chemistry teams into one lab. This building renovation also houses our regulatory affairs, supply chain and corporate service teams. 
We continued with the significant expansion and utilities upgrade of our manufacturing facility at 105 Lincoln Avenue in Buena, New Jersey. In October 2018, we received the Certificate of Occupancy to begin using our manufacturing facility, which includes a state-of-the-art quality control and microbiology lab for the testing of our pharmaceutical products. The expanded facility has increased our manufacturing capability for topical products and, upon FDA approval, will also enable the production of sterile injectable products in both vial and ampule presentations. We have utilized this facility expansion as an opportunity to upgrade and improve the degree of automation and capacity in our existing topical production suite. The sterile production area is designed around isolator-based technology. The facility includes a versatile vial and ampule filling line capable of between four and eight million units per year, with space and critical utilities included in the build-out for a potential future higher-speed filling line. Through December 31, 2020 the Company has incurred approximately $91.5 million for this project and is currently substantially complete with construction. We will use the new sterile production capability to support our internal R&D pipeline of sterile injectable products in vial and ampule presentations. These upgrades and expansion secure our long-term growth in manufacturing and marketing topical and injectable pharmaceutical products for sale in the U.S. and to expand our private label and contract manufacturing service opportunities. 
Teligent Canada and Teligent OÜ. In late 2015 in connection with the completion of certain acquisitions, we formed three subsidiaries: Teligent Luxembourg S.à.r.l. (“LuxCo”), a private limited company incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and wholly-owned by us, as well as Teligent Canada Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and Teligent OÜ, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Estonia, each of which are wholly-owned by LuxCo. 
Teligent Canada currently has 11 employees located in our offices in Mississauga, Canada, and currently markets and distributes over 31 products. In October 2020, after shifting our research and development activities to our Buena, New Jersey facility, we sold our Estonian assets and are in the process of winding down Teligent OÜ.
Our Generic Pharmaceutical Business
In September 2010, we leveraged our existing formulation and manufacturing capabilities to begin our transformation from being solely a contract development and manufacturing company into a generic pharmaceutical company with our own portfolio of products, as recognized by our first ANDA submission to the FDA in 2014. ANDAs are submitted to the FDA for generic prescription drug products that have the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as brand name innovator drug products to which they are bioequivalent, meaning that there is no significant difference between the drugs in their rate and extent of absorption in the body. In the United States, approved ANDA generic drugs are usually interchangeable with the innovator drug. This means that the generic version may generally be substituted for the branded product by either a physician or pharmacist when dispensing a prescription. Our commercialization of each of these product candidates requires approval of the respective ANDA by the FDA.
Our Contract Development and Manufacturing Business
We develop, manufacture, fill and package topical semi-solid and liquid products for branded and generic pharmaceutical customers, as well as the OTC and cosmetic markets. These products are used in a wide range of applications from cosmetics and cosmeceuticals to the prescription treatment of conditions like dermatitis, psoriasis and eczema.
We believe that our quality contract manufacturing and development business provides a consistent and reliable source of products and services to our customers. We offer flexibility in batch sizing and package design, which gives our customers the opportunity to select the appropriate presentation for each product. Our packaging lines can accommodate a variety of tubes, bottles, pumps and jars. Our recent upgrades and expansion secure our long-term growth prospects in manufacturing and marketing topical and injectable Pharmaceutical products for sale in the U.S. and to expand our private label and contract manufacturing service opportunities. We presently anticipate continuing our efforts to grow this business through the addition of new customers and products.
Recent Developments
Liquidity Issues
We have recently experienced significant liquidity issues and have engaged in a series of equitization and refinancing transactions. However, as discussed further below, we continue to experience significant financial and operating challenges that present substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As of the date of this Form 10-K filing, following the completion of our at-the-market common stock offering on April 30, 2021 we have approximately $25.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We expect to continue to explore and pursue other strategic cash raising options.
January 2021 Debt Exchange Transactions
On January 27, 2021, we completed a recapitalization and equitization transaction pursuant to an Exchange Agreement, dated January 27, 2021, among the Company, the Series C Noteholders (as defined below) and Ares (as defined below) (the “Exchange Agreement”). Under the Exchange Agreement, the holders (the “Series C Noteholders”) of all of our 9.5% Series C Senior Secured Convertible Notes due 2023 (the “Series C Notes”) exchanged an aggregate of approximately $50.3 million of outstanding principal under the Series C Notes, representing 100% of the outstanding principal under the Series C Notes, together with accrued interest thereon, for an aggregate of 29,862,641 shares (the “Series C Exchange Shares”) of our common stock (the “Series C Equitization”). The Series C Equitization resulted in the extinguishment of all of our obligations under the Indenture, dated as of July 20, 2020, between us and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent (the “Series C Indenture”).
Additionally, under the Exchange Agreement, certain credit funds and accounts managed by affiliates of Ares Management Corporation (such funds and accounts, collectively, “Ares” and, together with the Series C Noteholders, the “Participating Parties”) that are lenders under our Second Lien Credit Agreement, dated December 13, 2018, by and among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Ares Capital Corporation as Administrative Agent (as amended, including by the Second Lien Amendment (as defined below), the “Second Lien Credit Agreement”) converted a portion of the outstanding term loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement constituting 100% of the approximately $24.5 million in accrued PIK interest under the Second Lien Credit Agreement into an aggregate of 
approximately 85,412 shares of our newly created Series D Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series D Preferred Stock”, and such transaction, the “PIK Interest Exchange” and, together with the Series C Equitization, the “January 2021 Debt Exchange Transactions”). Each share of Series D Preferred Stock is non-voting and, subject to an increase in the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, is convertible into 200 shares of our common stock. The shares of Series D Preferred Stock issued in connection with the PIK Interest Exchange are currently convertible into an aggregate of 17,082,285 shares of our common stock. The holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock may not convert such shares of Series D Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock to the extent such a conversion would result in a holder thereof, together with its affiliates, collectively owning more than 15% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding.
The January 2021 Debt Exchange Transactions reduced the amount of indebtedness on our balance sheet from approximately $186.3 million to approximately $109.7 million. After giving effect to the January 2021 Debt Exchange Transactions and prior exchange transactions in which we extinguished all outstanding 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2023 (the "Series A Notes") and all outstanding 7.0% Cash / 8.0% PIK Series B Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2023 (the "Series B Notes"), our remaining indebtedness. as of January 27, 2021, consisted of:
•$105.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreements; and
•$1.3 million outstanding principal amount of our Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Series D Notes”) (described further below).
Our current amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes 100,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance. As of the date of this Form 10-K filing, we have 92,817,493 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. In addition, after giving effect to the January 2021 Debt Exchange Transactions, there are approximately 85,412 shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding, which are convertible into, in the aggregate, 17,082,285 shares of our common stock as of the date of this 10-K filing. As a result, there are presently an insufficient number of shares authorized and available for issuance under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock into common stock pursuant to the terms of such Series D Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, we are required to seek the requisite approval of our stockholders to an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to allow for the conversion in full of all shares of Series D Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock (either by an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock, the effectuation of a reverse stock split, or otherwise) (the “Stockholder Approval”). The Exchange Agreement provides that, if we are unable to obtain the Stockholder Approval on or before July 1, 2021, we will issue to each holder of Series D Preferred Stock, on a quarterly basis, additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock equal to 2.5% of the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock originally issued to such holder until the Stockholder Approval is obtained (with a prorated amount of Series D Preferred Stock to be issued in the event the Stockholder Approval is obtained during any such calendar quarter). We intend to seek Stockholder Approval at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders scheduled to be held on May 26, 2021.
As a condition to entering into the Exchange Agreement, we entered into a Stockholders’ Agreement with the Participating Parties and B. Riley Securities (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other matters, the Company granted (i) the Participating Parties registration rights for the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock and for the Series C Exchange Shares, and (ii) B. Riley Securities registration rights for the shares of common stock issued to B. Riley Securities as a commitment fee in connection with an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the “ATM Sales Agreement”), dated January 27, 2021, with B. Riley Securities, pursuant to which we conducted an at-the-market equity offering (the “ATM Offering”). In addition to the voting restrictions discussed further below, the Stockholders’ Agreement also contains terms restricting the transfer of shares of our common stock and Series D Preferred Stock held by the Participating Parties, including, subject to certain exceptions, a restriction on all sales or other transfers or dispositions of such shares (i) in respect of our recently completed at-the-market common stock offering, (ii) in any period during which we are conducting a follow-on public offering of our common stock within 11 months after the ATM Offering and ending on the earlier of 60 days after commencement of such offering or five trading days following its completion, (iii) in violation of certain volume restrictions set forth in the Stockholders’ Agreement (including the Rule 144 Volume Limitation (as defined in the Stockholders’ Agreement)) at any time when such Participating Party holds at least 9.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (including shares issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock) and (iv) to any person or entity that is required to file a statement on Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G with respect to our securities. The Stockholders’ Agreement also (x) subjects each Participating Party to certain standstill provisions for a period of 18 months following the date of the Stockholders’ Agreement, (y) requires each Participating Party to include, in any Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G that such Participating Party may be required to file in respect of our securities, an acknowledgment that such Participating Party has no intent to directly or indirectly control us or to take any actions contemplated by Section 5 of the Stockholders’ Agreement and (z) provides that the rights of each of Nantahala 
Capital Management, LLC (“Nantahala”) and Silverback Asset Management, LLC, two of our Series C Noteholders, to appoint a non-voting observer to our board of directors terminated upon the consummation of the Series C Exchange.
The Stockholders’ Agreement also contains certain voting restrictions as follows: (a) each Series C Noteholder and each of such Series C Noteholder’s affiliates will not vote any shares of our common stock held by such Series C Noteholder or such affiliates to the extent such vote would result in such Series C Noteholder and such affiliates, collectively, voting in excess of 4.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record date for such vote, and (b) Ares will not vote any shares of our common stock held by it to the extent such vote would result in Ares and its affiliates, collectively, voting in excess of 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record date for such vote. In addition, pursuant to Voting Trust Agreements among Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB (“WSFS Bank”), us and each of Nantahala and Silverback (the “Voting Trust Agreements”), we and each of Nantahala and Silverback established voting trusts with WSFS Bank to hold all Series C Exchange Shares issued to Nantahala or Silverback, respectively, in excess of 4.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and WSFS Bank has agreed to vote all such Series C Exchange Shares on all matters presented to the vote of our stockholders in the same proportions as all shares of our common stock other than (x) the Series C Exchange Shares held in trust by WSFS Bank; (y) any other shares of our common stock held by Nantahala or Silverback, as applicable and (z) other shares of our common stock held by the other Participating Parties.
Amendments to First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement
Also in connection with the January 2021 Debt Exchange Transactions, we entered into (i) Amendment No. 4 to First Lien Revolving Credit Agreement (the “First Lien Amendment”), amending the First Lien Credit Agreement, dated December 13, 2018, by and among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and ACF Finco I LP as Administrative Agent (as amended by the First Lien Amendment, the “First Lien Credit Agreement”), and (ii) Amendment No. 6 to Second Lien Credit Agreement (the “Second Lien Amendment”), pursuant to which all identified defaults and events of default thereunder were waived and certain amendments were made to the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement, respectively, including those described below. The First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement are referred to herein as the “Senior Credit Agreements,”, and such indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreements is referred to herein as the “Senior Credit Facilities”.
The First Lien Amendment amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) permit borrowings under the revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Agreement, subject to availability (which is $0 as of the date of this Form 10-K filing) and the other terms and conditions of the First Lien Credit Agreement, provided, that such borrowings are only available until the commitments of the lenders under the Second Lien Credit Agreement under the Second Lien Delayed Draw Term Loan C Facility (as defined below) have been reduced to $0, (ii) reduce from $10.0 million to $3.0 million (from and after the first draw of the Second Lien Delayed Drawn Term Loan C Facility described below) the maximum amount of cash that we and our subsidiaries that are credit parties under the First Lien Credit Agreement are permitted to maintain prior to triggering a mandatory prepayment of the revolving credit facility (without a permanent reduction of the revolving credit commitments), which $3.0 million threshold automatically increased by the net proceeds received from the January 28, 2021 ATM Offering and any other equity offering, (iii) reduce from $3.0 million to $1.0 million the minimum liquidity (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) required to be maintained by us and our subsidiaries that are credit parties under the First Lien Credit Agreement on a consolidated basis until the earlier of (a) the date on which the net proceeds from the January 28, 2021 offering exceed $15.0 million in the aggregate and (b) February 15, 2021, at which time the liquidity covenant increases to $3.0 million on a consolidated basis, (iv) from and after March 31, 2022, further increase the minimum liquidity covenant from $3.0 million to $4.0 million on a consolidated basis and (v) suspend testing of the minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant until March 31, 2022, at which time such minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant levels will resume to the levels in effect prior to the closing of the First Lien Amendment.
The Second Lien Amendment amended the Second Lien Credit Agreement to (i) permit, among other things, the January 2021 Debt Exchange Transactions, (ii) provide for a new multiple-draw delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $4.6 million (the “Second Lien Delayed Draw Term Loan C Facility”) which will be made available to us until December 31, 2021, subject to satisfaction of the conditions to borrowing, including, following the launch of this offering, a pro forma maximum liquidity test of $4.0 million, the proceeds of which may be used to pay expenses specified in a budget approved by the administrative agent under the Second Lien Credit Agreement, (iii) reduce from $3.0 million to $1.0 million the minimum liquidity (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement) required to be maintained by us and our subsidiaries that are credit parties under the Second Lien Credit Agreement on a consolidated basis until the earlier of (a) the date on which the net proceeds from the January 28, 2021 offering exceed $15.0 million in the aggregate and (b) February 15, 2021, at which time the minimum liquidity covenant increases to $3.0 million on a consolidated basis, (iv) from and after March 31, 2022, further increase the minimum liquidity covenant to $4.0 million on 
a consolidated basis, (v) suspend testing of the minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant until March 31, 2022, at which time such minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant levels will resume to the levels in effect prior to the closing of the Second Lien Amendment and (vi) extend the date on which we may elect to pay interest in kind. Loans made under the Second Lien Delayed Draw Term Loan C Facility will be pari passu with, and have the same interest and payment terms (including maturity) as those applicable to, the existing loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement.
Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern
We have incurred significant losses and generated negative cash flows from operations in recent years, and we expect to continue to incur losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. We are not currently generating revenues from operations that are sufficient to cover our operating expenses, and our available capital resources are not sufficient for us to continue to meet our obligations as they become due, presenting substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 were approximately $6.7 million, compared to approximately $16.2 million at December 31, 2019. We have engaged business, financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other matters, further analyzing all available strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure. 
As of the date of this Form 10-K filing, our cash and cash equivalents are approximately $25.2 million. In the absence of additional liquidity, we anticipate that existing cash resources, after giving effect to $4.6 million in interim funding under the Second Lien Credit Agreement, would be depleted by the end of March 2022. To remain viable, we estimate that we will require no less than approximately $20.0 million of additional liquidity to fund our cash requirements until December 31, 2022 (assuming, among other matters, the completion of the inspections under the FDA Warning Letter (described further below) and a reduction in the impact on our operations and financial results from the COVID-19 pandemic), although this estimate is subject to a number of assumptions and may vary materially. 
We have been and are actively pursuing potential sources of additional liquidity, including:
•Equity Financing. We completed the at-the-market offering on March 31, 2021 with aggregate gross proceeds of $38,712,036 from the sale of shares of our common stock at an average price of $0.993 per share. 
•Debt Financing. As discussed in “January 2021 Debt Exchange Transactions” above, we have undertaken several deleveraging transactions to reduce our indebtedness and our related costs of capital. Additionally, we have worked with our lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities to obtain short-term financing to meet our immediate liquidity needs, including $4.6 million in interim funding under the Second Lien Credit Agreement. At the commencement of the ATM offering, we and Ares agreed to amendments of the Senior Credit Agreements to provide for an extension of relief from certain financial covenants (including, among others, our minimum liquidity covenant through March 31, 2022). There can be no assurances that our senior lenders will continue to provide interim financing or other relief from the covenants contained in our Senior Credit Agreements, from which we may need one or more additional waivers based on our currently expected results. In the event such waivers are not extended and we violate one or more of certain specified covenants in our Senior Credit Agreements, such violation may lead to one or more events of default under the Senior Credit Agreements, which may trigger certain cross-default provisions under the terms of any other indebtedness then in effect. We continue to engage with our business, financial and legal advisors to further analyze and explore new potential transactions to refinance or restructure our remaining outstanding debt.
•Strategic Alternatives. We have engaged in discussions with a number of counterparties and remain opportunistic with respect to potential transactions for certain of our strategic assets. We expect to continue to engage in such explorations as we and our board of directors determine are appropriate; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such potential transaction on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all.
It is very difficult to estimate our liquidity requirements, future cash burn rates and future operating results, and any such estimates may vary significantly. Further, it is very difficult to determine when our operating environment will change to allow us to return to more normalized operations, including in respect of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. By way of example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in elective visits to dermatologists in the United States, which has led to a reduction in the volume of prescriptions written for topical products customarily supplied by us, which has negatively impacted our revenue. Further, the FDA Warning Letter (discussed further below) has prevented us from launching our new sterile injectable product line to be produced at our new facility, and due to regulatory and inventory production requirements, as well as certain issues of non-conformance with respect to certain products identified during our review undertaken in connection with the FDA Warning Letter (including, among other matters, product recalls, 
long-term production pauses, short-term clear path to market production pauses, and continued production with minor process correction), we anticipate continuing to experience a significant delay in the launch of such product line even after the restrictions imposed by the FDA Warning Letter are rescinded (if such restrictions are rescinded at all). We also continue to experience significant pressures on our liquidity related to remediation efforts arising in respect of the FDA Warning Letter. While we believe we have made substantial progress in remediating the issues identified in the FDA Warning Letter and in subsequent internal reviews, the FDA has significantly reduced its on-site inspections during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, there can be no assurances as to when the FDA will re-inspect our Buena, NJ facility and whether (and to what extent) the FDA will agree to remove the restrictions imposed by the FDA Warning Letter following such re-inspection.
As such, there is substantial doubt that any of these potential sources of liquidity will be realized or that, if realized, they will generate sufficient liquidity required by us until we are able to achieve more normalized operating results. Further, given the substantial doubts of our ability to proceed as a going concern and the significant operational challenges we face in the near- and long-term, there can be no assurances that any or all of these potential sources of liquidity will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 
FDA Warning Letter
As part of our efforts to remediate the issues identified in the FDA’s warning letter issued in November 2019 (the “FDA Warning Letter”) and to strengthen our quality systems, we undertook a comprehensive review of all of our products. This review was completed in December 2020. While the review did not identify material issues with many of our products, it identified certain issues of non-conformance with respect to certain products which have resulted in recalls and halting the production of certain products, that we are actively reviewing and remediating. We have experienced and may continue to experience, among other matters, product recalls, long-term production pauses, short-term clear path to market production pauses, and continued production with minor process corrections. We believe the foregoing disruptions with respect to certain of our products and the diversion of resources to remediate the product quality issues will have a negative impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows during 2021, including reducing our revenue, negatively impacting operating/(loss), and possibly resulting in impairment and other charges. Further, we anticipate that the FDA’s issuance of the warning letter and review of our processes will continue to delay the FDA’s pre-approval inspection for commercial production on the newly installed injectable line at the Buena, NJ facility. The continued failure to address the issues identified by the FDA in its warning letter and those subsequently identified by us in our comprehensive product quality review as well as the continued delay in obtaining the FDA’s pre-approval inspection for commercial production on the newly installed injectable line at the Buena, NJ facility will have a negative impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
COVID-19 Response
As a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, we are considered “essential” under applicable directives from the state of New Jersey. We have and anticipate continuing to remain open as long as permitted and conditions remain safe for our employees. Among other preventative measures, we have directed all employees that could perform their function remotely to work from home in accordance with applicable guidelines, implemented social distancing measures on-site at our manufacturing facility, provided daily personal protective equipment to our onsite employees upon their arrival to the site and implemented temperature monitoring services at our newly established single point of entrance. We have also implemented a more frequent sanitization process of the facility.
In order to preserve cash and align manufacturing-related resources with downward adjustments made to our production schedule, we initiated a reduction in force at our Buena, NJ manufacturing facility effective June 19, 2020. In connection with the reduction, we terminated 53 employees, furloughed another 15 employees and eliminated the 2nd shift packaging operation. Our employee base after these actions, coupled with our Company-wide effort to reduce recruitment initiated earlier in the year, is down 31% from January 1, 2020.
In addition, we decided to shift our research and development operation being performed in our Tallinn, Estonia office to our US manufacturing site at Buena, New Jersey and subsequently to wind-down our Estonia operation. On September 30, 2020, we sold certain of our assets located in Estonia, primarily lab machinery, equipment and office furniture, for a sales price of $125,000 in cash to an entity led by our former Chief Executive Officer.
Termination of S-3 Eligibility
We failed to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2020 (the “Third Quarter 10-Q”). We are filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”), such filing will serve as an update of our current registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-224188) (the “Current Form S-3”) for purposes of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 401(b) promulgated under the Securities Act. Because of our failure to timely file the Third Quarter 10-Q, we will not be eligible to use Form S-3, including our Current Form S-3, after we file our 2020 Form 10-K. At such time, if we have not already done so, we will be required to cease the at-the-market offering contemplated by the January 28, 2021 prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus at the time this 2020 Form 10-K is filed (to the extent such at-the-market offering has not already been terminated) and in no event later than March 31, 2021 and, as a result, are not currently eligible to file a Registration Statement on Form S-3. This may make is more difficult for us to conduct public offering of our securities. 
Our Competitive Strategy
We develop and market a diversified product portfolio focused on high-barrier dosage form generic pharmaceutical products. Our goal is to become a leader in the generic pharmaceutical market. Under our own label, we currently market and sell generic topical, branded generic and generic injectable, and generic ophthalmic pharmaceutical products in the United States and Canada. In the United States, we are currently marketing 37 generic topical pharmaceutical products and two branded generic injectable pharmaceutical products. In Canada, we market 25 generic injectable, three generic topical, and three generic ophthalmic products. Generic pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent to their brand name counterparts. We also provide contract manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical, over-the-counter, ("OTC"), and cosmetic markets. We have been in the contract manufacturing and development of topical products business since the early 1990s, but our strategy since 2010 has been focused on the growth of our own generic prescription pharmaceutical business. In 2014, we started the transformation of our business from working toward being a leader in the topical generic pharmaceutical industry to becoming a leader in high-barrier generic pharmaceutical markets. We believe that expanding our development and commercial base beyond topical generics, historically the cornerstone of our expertise, to include injectable generics and other high-barrier dosage forms will leverage our existing expertise and capabilities, and broaden our platform for diversified strategic growth. Additionally, while we have experienced some success in that regard, during the last year, as we have experienced the unfavorable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have begun to reexamine all of our expertise and assets in order to reinvigorate and bolster our business. This has resulted in our placing additional emphasis on the development of our private label business as well as our contract development and manufacturing business. 
Our Strategy
Our strategy originated from the opportunity to leverage our value chain, which we have developed and strengthened through our topical portfolio. Our value chain includes our internal expertise in product and molecule selection and development, manufacturing, sales, logistics and distribution, as well as our relationships with our customers and consumers. With the expansion of our existing manufacturing facility, we see the potential to effectively leverage our existing infrastructure across this value chain and to further expand our strategic reach beyond topical generics to include injectable generics and other high-barrier dosage forms.
Our focus on the topical market has been the foundation for our growth. While we have manufactured topical products since the early 1990s, we began to focus our strategy on the topical generic prescription market in 2010. In December 2012, we launched our first generic topical pharmaceutical products under our own label. Currently, we market 37 generic topical products in the United States under our own label. We have received FDA approvals for 36 topical generic products from our internally developed pipeline. In our topical pipeline, we have seven ANDAs submitted to the FDA that are awaiting approval. We are targeting to develop and file further regulatory submissions with the FDA in 2022 Upon regulatory approval, we would market these products under the Teligent label to national chain drug stores, drug wholesalers, mail order pharmacies, retail pharmacies and the government through our internal sales efforts.
In our topical contract development and manufacturing services business, we have developed strong customer relationships that we believe provide us with both recurring revenue streams from those customers and opportunities to selectively increase our product offerings to our customers. We intend to continue to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to maintain and grow contract development and manufacturing revenues.
We have an FDA-registered facility that is equipped for manufacturing topical, semi-solid and liquid products. The design and configuration of our manufacturing facility provides flexibility in manufacturing batch sizes from 250 kg up to 2,400 kg. We intend to leverage this flexibility and capacity to support our growth in the topical prescription markets. We 
completed a significant expansion and utilities upgrade in this facility which increased our manufacturing capacity for topical products.
On November 26, 2019, we received a warning letter from the FDA following an inspection from April 2, 2019 to May 20, 2019 of our Buena, New Jersey manufacturing facility (the “FDA Warning Letter”). The FDA Warning Letter cited issues regarding out-of-specification test results, our stability program, our complaint handling, and drug product validation issues. We investigated the issues with the assistance of a consultant, responded to the FDA in December 2019 and March 2020, and submitted a final closeout letter on April 12, 2020. On August 13, 2020, we received an additional comment letter from the FDA in which the FDA indicated that it had reviewed our responses and deemed them to be inadequate as we failed to address and/or provide supporting documentation to several of the concerns raised in the FDA Warning Letter. We have since submitted supplemental response letters to the FDA outlining certain additional changes in our practices, submitting additional documentation to support previous and ongoing independent assessments, providing updates to our organizational structure, and providing further detail in regard to ongoing remediation projects (including comprehensive product quality assessments) to ensure all of our products are safe, effective and compliant. As part of our efforts to remediate the issues identified in the FDA Warning Letter and to strengthen our quality systems, we have undertaken and completed a comprehensive review of all of our products during the fourth quarter of 2020. While the review did not identify material issues with many of our products, it did identify issues of non-conformance with respect to certain products, which has resulted in recalls and halting the production of certain products, that we are actively reviewing and remediating. We are continuing to work diligently to remediate all issues cited by the FDA and those resulting from our comprehensive quality review, have and will continue to have active communications with the FDA regarding our progress and we believe we will be in a position to inform FDA of our inspection readiness by the third quarter of 2021. Since we cannot control the timing of the FDA re-inspection of the facility, we cannot predict the date when FDA will perform the site re-inspection. For additional discussion of the risks related to the FDA Warning Letter, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Issues identified by the FDA in the FDA Warning Letter and additional product quality issues identified by us will have a negative impact on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows and will delay the FDA’s pre-approval inspection of our newly installed injectable line.”
Our Customers

Generic Pharmaceutical Business. The manufacturing and commercialization of generic pharmaceutical products is competitive, and there are established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors actively engaged in all phases of our business. We currently manufacture and sell topical generic pharmaceutical products under our own label. We currently market over 70 products in the US and Canada. As we continue to execute our strategy, we expect to face increasing competition.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, 47% and 41% of our total product sales, net, respectively, were to the three large wholesale drug distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, or ABC; Cardinal Health, Inc., or Cardinal; and McKesson Drug Company, or McKesson. As of December 31, 2020, Cardinal accounted for 19% of our accounts receivable, ABC accounted for 8% of our accounts receivable, and McKesson accounted for 48% of our accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2019, Cardinal accounted for 22% of our accounts receivable, McKesson accounted for 25% of our accounts receivable, and ABC accounted for approximately 11% of our accounts receivable.

ABC, Cardinal and McKesson are key distributors of our products, as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies. None of these distributors is an end user of our products. Generally, if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease, we believe that the end users of our products would likely find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor. However, the loss of one or more of these distributors, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There are generally three major negotiating entities in the US market: (i) the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development (WBAD), which consists of Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen’s PRxO Generics program, (ii) Red Oak Sourcing, which consists of CVS and Cardinal’s source program and (iii) ClarusOne, which consists of Walmart, RiteAid and McKesson’s OneStop program. A loss of any of these major entities could result in a significant reduction in revenue.
We consider our business relationships with ABC, Cardinal and McKesson to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of them. However, a change in purchasing patterns, a decrease in inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We continue to analyze the market for other opportunities to expand our current relationships with other customers, while we continue to seek to diversify our existing portfolio of specialty generic drug products through internal 
research and development. In addition, we continue to explore business development opportunities to add additional products and /or capabilities to our existing portfolio.

Contract Development and Manufacturing Business. Our customers in the contract manufacturing business generally consist of pharmaceutical companies, as well as cosmetic and OTC product marketers, who require product development/manufacturing support. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 49% of our contract services revenue was derived from pharmaceutical customers, as compared to 54% of total contract services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. None of our contract manufacturing services customers represented 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. 

Concentration of Risk. In 2020, we had sales to three customers which accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. These customers had sales of $11.5 million, $5.2 million, and $4.5 million, respectively and represented 47% of total revenues in aggregate. Accounts receivable related to these three customers represented 75% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020. In 2019, we had sales to two customers which individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. These customers had sales of $17.6 million and $9.6 million, respectively, and represented 41% of total revenues in the aggregate. Accounts receivable related to these major customers represented 31% of all accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019.
Expansion into foreign operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 has generated net revenues greater than 10% outside of the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2020, domestic net revenues were $34.5 million and foreign net revenues were $10.8 million. As of December 31, 2020, domestic net assets were $139.9 million and foreign assets were $41.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, domestic net revenues were $48.4 million and foreign net revenues were $17.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, domestic assets were $154.3 million and foreign assets were $52.6 million. 

Our Products

There was no product which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total revenues in 2020. Diflorasone Diacetate Ointment USP 0.05% accounted for 15% of the Company's total revenues in 2019.

Our Suppliers

We require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and third parties with which we have contracted. The principal components of our products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials. The APIs and other materials and supplies used in our pharmaceutical manufacturing operations are generally available and purchased from many different U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers. However, in some cases, the raw materials used to manufacture pharmaceutical products are available only from a single supplier. Even when more than one supplier exists, we may choose, and in some cases have chosen, only to list one supplier in our applications submitted to the FDA. Any change in a supplier not previously approved must then be submitted through a formal approval process with the FDA. 
Research and Development 

Our R&D activities are integral to our business and are conducted at our facilities in Buena, New Jersey. The R&D team is responsible for formulation, reverse engineering, methods development, analytical and microbiologic testing and scale up, and regulatory expertise. Our employees have specific expertise in developing injectable products and topical products in a wide range of formulation types, including simple solutions through complex creams. All ANDA topical development is conducted in-house except for bioequivalence testing, which is performed by a contract research organization ("CRO"). Our injectable development is primarily conducted in house with some assistance from certain CRO's. 
We incurred $7.7 million and $10.8 million in R&D expenses in 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Product Development and Government Regulation

United States

Prescription pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are generally marketed as either brand or generic drugs. Brand products are usually marketed under brand names through marketing programs that are designed to generate physician and consumer loyalty. Brand products are patent protected, which provides a period of market exclusivity during which time they are sold with little or no competition for the compound, although there typically are other participants in the therapeutic area. Additionally, brand products may benefit from other periods of non-patent market exclusivity available under various provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Exclusivity normally provides brand products with the ability to maintain their profitability for a period of time and brand products typically continue to play a significant role in the market due to physician and consumer loyalties after the end of patent protection or other market exclusivities.

Generic pharmaceutical products are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of the brand product, also known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. A reference listed brand drug is an approved drug product listed in the FDA publication entitled Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, popularly known as the Orange Book. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides that generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA. An ANDA approval requires that bioequivalence to the reference listed drug be demonstrated and also requires that any patents on the corresponding reference listed drug be expired, invalidated, non-infringed and/or any other relevant market exclusivity periods related to the reference listed drug be expired as well. Generic drugs are bioequivalent to their reference brand name counterparts. Accordingly, generic products provide a safe, effective and cost-efficient alternative to users of these reference brand products. Branded generic pharmaceutical products are generic products in that they are approved for marketing under an ANDA, but they may be more responsive to promotion efforts generally used to promote branded pharmaceutical products. Growth in the generic pharmaceutical industry has been, and will continue to be, driven by the increased market acceptance of generic drugs, as well as the number of brand drugs for which patent terms and/or other market exclusivities have expired.

We obtain new generic products primarily through internal product development. Additionally, we license or co-develop products through arrangements with other companies. All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. Information to support the bioequivalence of generic drug products or the safety and effectiveness of new drug products for their intended use is also required to be submitted. There are generally two types of applications used for obtaining FDA approval of new products:

•New Drug Application — An NDA is filed when approval is sought to market a newly developed branded product and, in certain instances, for a new dosage form, a new delivery system or a new indication for a previously approved drug.
•Abbreviated New Drug Application — An ANDA is filed when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug product previously approved under an NDA and listed in the FDA’s Orange Book (i.e., an 
 RLD) or for a new dosage strength for a drug previously approved under an ANDA.
The ANDA development process is generally less time-consuming and complex than the NDA development process. It typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the RLD previously approved through the NDA process. The ANDA process, however, does typically require one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference listed brand drug. Bioequivalence studies compare the bioavailability of the proposed drug product with that of the RLD product containing the same active ingredient. Bioavailability is a measure of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action in a human patient. Thus, a demonstration of bioequivalence confirms the absence of a significant difference between the proposed product and the reference listed brand drug in terms of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions.

Generic products are generally introduced to the marketplace at the expiration of patent protection for the brand product or at the end of a period of non-patent market exclusivity. However, if an ANDA applicant files an ANDA containing a certification of invalidity, non-infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed in the Orange Book with respect to the relevant RLD, the applicant may be able to market the generic equivalent prior to the expiration of patent protection for the brand product. Such patent certification is commonly referred to as a Paragraph IV certification. If the holder of the NDA sues, claiming infringement or invalidation, within 45 days of notification by the applicant, the FDA may not approve the ANDA application until the earlier of the rendering of a court decision favorable to the ANDA applicant or the 
expiration of 30 months. An ANDA applicant that is first to file a Paragraph IV certification is eligible for a period of generic marketing exclusivity. This exclusivity, which under certain circumstances may be required to be shared with other ANDA sponsors that have made Paragraph IV certifications, lasts for 180 days, during which the FDA cannot grant final approval to other ANDA applications for a generic equivalent to the same reference drug.

In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent market exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a generic version product. If the reference drug is a new chemical entity, the FDA may not accept an ANDA for a generic product for up to five years following approval of the NDA for the new chemical entity. If it is not a new chemical entity, but the holder of the NDA conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the NDA or a supplement thereto, the FDA may not approve an ANDA for a reference NDA product before the expiration of three years. Certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the RLD is indicated for treatment of a rare disease (i.e., orphan drug exclusivity) or the sponsor conducts pediatric studies in accordance with FDA requirements.

Supplemental ANDAs are required to secure FDA for approval of various types of changes to an approved application and these supplements may be under review for six months or more. In addition, certain types of changes may only be approved once new bioequivalence studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied.

An additional requirement for FDA approval of NDAs and ANDAs is that our manufacturing procedures and operations conform to FDA requirements and guidelines, generally referred to as current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. The requirements for FDA approval encompass all aspects of the production process, including validation and recordkeeping, which are continuously changing and evolving.
In addition to generic products that are approved for marketing via ANDAs, Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate. Unlike the ANDA pathway used for bioequivalent versions of brand products, which does not allow applicants to submit new clinical data other than bioavailability or bioequivalence data, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that a follow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies; for example, they may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness.

Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and other authorities. In addition, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. Our suppliers are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.

In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, was enacted into law. FDASIA is intended to enhance the safety and security of the U.S. drug supply chain by holding all drug manufacturers supplying products to the U.S. to the same FDA inspection standards and schedules.

FDASIA also included the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA), a novel user fee program focused on three key aims:

•Safety – Ensure that industry participants, foreign or domestic, are held to consistent quality standards and are inspected with parity using a risk-based approach.
•Access – Expedite the availability of generic drugs by bringing greater predictability to the review times for abbreviated new drug applications, amendments and supplements and improving timeliness in the review process.
•Transparency – Enhance FDA’s visibility into the complex global supply environment by requiring the identification of facilities involved in the manufacture of generic drugs and associated APIs, and to improve the FDA’s communications and feedback with industry.
Under GDUFA, 70% of the total fees were derived from facility fees paid by Finished Dosage Form manufacturers and API facilities listed in pending or approved generic drug applications. The remaining 30% of the total fees were derived 
from application fees, including generic drug application fees, prior approval supplement fees and fees for certain types of Drug Master Files, or DMFs.

In August 2017, Congress passed and the President signed the FDA Reauthorization Act (FDARA). Among other provisions, FDARA included the second iteration of GDUFA, or “GDUFA II,” to reauthorize the collection of these user fees from industry for another 5 years, i.e., through September 2022. GDUFA II also made significant changes to the generic drug user fee program, including eliminating the fee for Prior Approval Supplements and creating a new Generic Drug Applicant Annual Program Fee, assessed based on the number of approved ANDAs owned by a company and its affiliates. The new Annual Program Fee is expected to account for approximately 62% of fees collected by FDA under GDUFA. In exchange, GDUFA II implements a number of elements to enhance communication between FDA and industry throughout the ANDA review process, thereby improving predictability and transparency and promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the generic drug review process. 
Canada

In Canada, the registration process for approval of all generic pharmaceuticals has two tracks that proceed in parallel. The first track of the process involves an examination of the proposed generic product by Health Canada, the federal department responsible for national public health, to ensure that the quality, safety and efficacy of the proposed generic product meets Canadian standards and bioequivalence requirements. The second track concerns patent rights of the brand drug owner. Companies may submit an application called an abbreviated new drug submission, or ANDS, to Health Canada that compares the proposed generic drug to another drug marketed in Canada under a Notice of Compliance, or NOC, issued to a first person. When Health Canada is satisfied that the generic pharmaceutical product described in the ANDS satisfies the statutory requirements, it issues an NOC for that product for the uses specified in the ANDS, subject to any court order that may be made in the second track of the approval process.

The second track of the approval process is governed by the Patented Medicines NOC Regulations, or the Regulations. We currently do not have any applications in development that would utilize this track. 
Section C.08.004.1 of the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations is the so-called data protection provision, and the current version of this section applies in respect of all drugs for which an NOC was issued on or after June 17, 2006. A subsequent applicant for approval to market a drug for which an NOC has already been issued does not need to perform duplicate clinical trials similar to those conducted by the first NOC holder, but is permitted to demonstrate safety and efficacy by submitting data demonstrating that its formulation is bioequivalent to the formulation that was issued for the first NOC. The first party to obtain an NOC for a drug will have an eight-year period of exclusivity starting from the date it received its NOC based on those clinical data. A subsequent applicant for approval that seeks to establish safety and efficacy by comparing its product to the product that received the first NOC will not be able to file its own application until six years after the issuance of the first NOC. The Minister of Health will not be permitted to issue a NOC to that applicant until eight years after the issuance of the first NOC — this additional two-year period will correspond in most cases to the 24-month automatic stay under the Regulations. If the first person provides the Minister with the description and results of clinical trials relating to the use of the drug in pediatric populations, it will be entitled to an extra six months of data protection. A drug is only entitled to data protection so long as it is being marketed in Canada.

Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by Health Canada. In addition, Health Canada conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems are in compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices in Canada, Drug Establishment Licensing requirements and other provisions of the Regulations. Competitors are subject to similar regulations and inspections.

The federal government, provinces and territories in Canada operate drug benefit programs through which eligible recipients receive drugs through public funding; these drugs are listed on provincial or territorial Drug Benefit Formularies (each, a “Formulary”). Eligible recipients include First Nations and Inuit clients, seniors, persons on social assistance, low-income earners, and those with certain specified conditions or diseases. Formulary listings are also used by private payors to reimburse generic products. To be listed in a Formulary, drug products must have received an NOC from Health Canada and must comply with each jurisdiction’s individual review process. 

The primary regulatory approval for pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and importers selling pharmaceuticals to be marketed in Canada is the issuance of an establishment license, or EL. An EL is issued to a Canadian facility once Health Canada has approved the facilities in which the pharmaceuticals are manufactured, distributed or imported. A key requirement for EL-issuance is compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices as set out by Health Canada. For pharmaceuticals that are imported into Canada, the license for the Canadian importing facility must list all foreign sites at 
which imported pharmaceuticals, and their active ingredients, are manufactured and tested. To be listed on our EL, all our foreign sites must demonstrate compliance with relevant Good Manufacturing Practices recognized by Health Canada.

Sales and Marketing

We sell, distribute and market our prescription drug products to national chain drug stores and drug wholesalers and distributors and group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, in the United States and Canada. This commercialization infrastructure includes satisfying our state, provincial, territorial, or national licensing requirements, implementing procedures with our third-party logistics partners, and maintaining appropriate sales order to cash administrative processes and a manager of national accounts to manage our sales.
Competition

In our generic topical prescription drug business, we face competition from other generic drug manufacturers and brand-name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics. Although there are a significant number of competitors in the generic drug market, there are fewer competitors in the topical generic drug market. The five dominant companies in the topical generic drug market are: Perrigo Company, Sandoz (the generic pharmaceutical division of Novartis AG), Taro Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Mylan N.V., and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. We believe the concentrated nature of the topical generic drug market creates an opportunity for us to be able to compete based on a variety of factors, including our focus on niche opportunities within the market segment and our dedication to quality in every area of our business.

In our generic injectable prescription drug business, we also face competition from other generic drug manufacturers and brand-name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics. Although there are a significant number of competitors in the generic drug market, there are fewer dominant competitors in the injectable generic drug market. The four dominant companies in the injectable generic drug market in the United States consist of Fresenius Kabi USA, Pfizer, Par and Hikma. In Canada, we face competition from largely the same firms as in the United States as well as certain Canada-only firms. The Canadian generic injectable market is dominated by Sandoz (the generic pharmaceutical division of Novartis AG), Pfizer Injectables and Fresenius Kabi Canada. 

Our generic injectable strategy is focused on injectable products with limited competition, and products that have a history of lack of supply, or instability in the supply chain, where we can add value and leverage on our ability to be a reliable supplier to the marketplace.  We believe the concentrated nature of some molecules within the injectable generic drug market, and history of lack of supply of certain molecules in the marketplace, create opportunities for us that we believe will enable us to compete based on a variety of factors, including our focus on niche opportunities within the market segment and our dedication to quality in every area of our business.

The contract development and manufacturing services market is highly competitive and includes larger organizations with substantially greater resources than us. Many of our competitors are companies that commercialize and/or manufacture their required products at their own facilities. These competitors include major pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers and consumer health product companies that generally have substantially greater manufacturing, R&D, marketing and financial resources than us and, in some cases, have more geographically diversified international operations. We compete specifically with a number of different privately held contract manufacturing companies. Although this market is competitive, the competition is limited due to the need for specific expertise in topical formulations and cGMP facilities. We believe that we have the expertise required and we will continue to service our existing customers in this market by providing high quality, customer-oriented service, complemented by our contract development expertise in topical formulations.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent state and local regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Our manufacturing facility uses, in varying degrees, hazardous substances in its processes. Contamination at our facility can result and has resulted in liability to us, for which we have recorded appropriate reserves as needed. For example, two of the Company’s facilities have undergone remediation of environmental contamination. 
Intellectual Property

To compete effectively, we need to develop and maintain a proprietary position with regard to our technology, product candidates and business. Our goal is to safeguard our trade secrets and know-how, attain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology. We seek to achieve this protection through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents.

We depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and R&D personnel, as well as that of our consultants, advisors and collaborators. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely, and will continue to rely in the future, on confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to any other parties. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. We understand that these agreements may not provide us with adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure.

We also seek to obtain patent protection when necessary, and we understand that this may not provide us with complete protection against competitors who may attempt to circumvent our patents.

Facility and Operations

The Company’s executive administrative offices are located in Buena, New Jersey, in two facilities which originally were approximately 33,000 square feet built on 8.44 acres of land in 1995, which we own. In 2017 we acquired an additional 3.0 acres of adjacent land in support of our facility expansion. We now own a total of 11.44 acres at our Buena facility. The facilities are used for production, product-testing, product development, and warehousing for our pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical and cosmetic products. We completed construction on an expansion of our Buena, New Jersey facility to total approximately 110,000 square feet. The expanded facility has increased our manufacturing capability for topical products and will also enable the production of sterile injectable products in both vial and ampule presentations upon FDA approval. The sterile production area is designed around isolator-based technology. Our capabilities encompass a full suite of competencies, including manufacturing, regulatory, quality assurance and in-house validation. We are using this facility expansion as an opportunity to secure our long-term growth in manufacturing and marketing injectable in the US and to upgrade and improve the degree of automation and capacity in our existing topical production suite. 

We operate our facility in accordance with cGMP. Our facility is registered with the FDA as a drug establishment. We believe that our facility and equipment are in good condition, are well-maintained and can operate at present levels. Our manufacturing operations are focused on regulatory compliance, continuous improvement, process standardization and excellence in quality and execution across the organization. On November 26, 2019, the FDA issued us a Warning Letter following an inspection of our manufacturing facility at 105 Lincoln Avenue, Buena, New Jersey, that identified several cGMP violations. 
We lease additional warehouse space in Vineland, New Jersey, as needed to complement our existing warehouse capacity.

The Company also leases approximately 9,500 square feet of corporate office space in Iselin, New Jersey, and approximately 4,000 square feet of office space in Mississauga, Canada.

Human Capital Resources

Our employees are the heart of our Company. On December 31, 2020, we had a total of 142 full-time employees, including 11 full-time employees in Canada. In addition, as the need arises, we occasionally utilize short-term, part-time employees who are paid on an hourly basis. We also utilize temporary employees provided by third-parties on a regular basis, primarily in our production department. We do not have a collective bargaining agreement with our employees and we believe that our employee relations are good.
In the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry, it is imperative that we attract, develop and retain top talent on an ongoing basis. To do this, we seek to make Teligent an inclusive, diverse and safe workplace, with meaningful compensation, benefits and wellness programs, and offering training and leadership development programs that foster career growth.
Our executive leadership team and Board of Directors play key roles in overseeing culture and talent at Teligent and devote time throughout the year to human capital strategy and execution in such areas as: inclusion and diversity, Company culture, employee engagement, training and development, recruiting and turnover, leadership development and succession planning. Management regularly updates the Board on internal metrics in these areas.
