      ITEM 1.    BUSINESS. 
Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker started Floral City Furniture in 1927, and in 1928 the newly formed company introduced its first recliner. In 1941, we were incorporated in the state of Michigan as La-Z-Boy Chair Company, and in 1996 we changed our name to La-Z-Boy Incorporated. Today, our La-Z-Boy brand is the most recognized brand in the furniture industry and we are proud to be celebrating our 90th anniversary this fiscal year. 
 We manufacture, market, import, export, distribute and retail upholstery furniture products. In addition, we import, distribute and retail accessories and casegoods (wood) furniture products. We are the leading global producer of reclining chairs and the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential furniture in the United States. The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores retail network is the third largest retailer of single-branded furniture in the United States. We have seven major North American manufacturing locations and six regional distribution centers in the United States to support our speed-to-market and customization strategy. 
 We sell our products, primarily in the United States and Canada, to furniture retailers and directly to consumers through stores that we own and operate. The centerpiece of our retail distribution strategy is our network of 347 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores and 557 Comfort Studio® locations, each dedicated to marketing our La-Z-Boy branded products. We consider this dedicated space to be "branded outlets" or "proprietary." In addition to the over 900 branded outlets dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy product (La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores and Comfort Studio® locations), approximately 1,900 other dealers also sell La-Z-Boy, including some of the best known names in the industry, such as Art Van, Nebraska Furniture Mart and Slumberland. We own 143 of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores. The remainder of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores, as well as all 557 Comfort Studio® locations, are independently owned and operated. La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores help consumers furnish their homes by combining the style, comfort, and quality of La-Z-Boy furniture with our available design services. La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations are defined spaces within larger independent retailers that are dedicated to displaying and selling La-Z-Boy branded products. Our other brands, which include England, Kincaid, American Drew, and Hammary, enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets, with approximately half of Hammary's sales originating through the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network. Kincaid and England have their own dedicated proprietary in-store programs with 527 outlets and over 1.7 million square feet of proprietary floor space. In total, our proprietary floor space encompasses approximately 9.7 million square feet. 
   Principal Products and Industry Segments 
 Our reportable operating segments are the Upholstery segment, the Casegoods segment and the Retail segment. 
  Upholstery Segment.    Our Upholstery segment is our largest business and consists primarily of two operating units: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating unit, and our England subsidiary. The Upholstery segment also includes our international businesses, including the recently acquired La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Our Upholstery segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas. The Upholstery segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores, operators of Comfort Studio® locations and England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers. 
  Casegoods Segment.    Our Casegoods segment is an importer, marketer and distributor of casegoods (wood) furniture such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces, and also manufactures some coordinated upholstered furniture. The Casegoods segment consists of 
 4

   three brands: American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid. The Casegoods segment sells directly to major dealers, as well as La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers. 
  Retail Segment.    Our Retail segment consists of 143 company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores. The Retail segment primarily sells upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other accessories, to the end consumer through these stores. 
 We have provided additional detailed information regarding our segments and their products in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and our "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section, both of which are included in this report. 
   Raw Materials and Parts 
 The principal raw materials and parts used in our Upholstery segment are purchased cover (primarily fabrics and leather), polyester batting and polyurethane foam for cushioning and padding, lumber and plywood for frames, steel for motion mechanisms, and electrical components for power units. We purchase about 50% of our polyurethane foam from one supplier, which has several facilities across the United States that deliver to our plants. We purchase cover from a variety of sources, but we rely on a limited number of major suppliers. We purchase approximately 55% of our cover in a raw state (fabric rolls or leather hides) and cut and sew it into cover, and 45% in covers that have already been cut and sewn to our specifications by third-party offshore suppliers. We buy cut-and-sewn leather and fabric products from four primary suppliers. Of the products that we import, two suppliers that operate in China manufacture over 90% of the leather cut-and-sewn sets, and two other suppliers that also operate in China manufacture almost 85% of the fabric products. We primarily use these suppliers for their product design capabilities, to leverage our buying power, and to control quality and product flow, in addition to their ability to handle the volume of product we require to operate our business. If any of these suppliers experienced financial or other difficulties, we could experience temporary disruptions in our manufacturing process until we obtained alternate suppliers. 
 We have identified efficiencies, savings opportunities, and managed relationships with our Asian suppliers through our global trading company in Hong Kong, which procures raw materials and parts from our suppliers. During fiscal 2017, the prices of materials we used in our upholstery manufacturing process were essentially unchanged compared with fiscal 2016. We expect to experience a slight increase in raw material costs in fiscal 2018. In an effort to somewhat offset the projected rise in raw material costs we have slightly increased our selling prices. 
   Finished Goods Imports 
 We import 100% of the casegoods products that we offer for sale. In fiscal 2017, we purchased approximately 50% of this imported product from three suppliers. We primarily use these suppliers to leverage our buying power, to control quality and product flow, and because their capabilities align with our product design needs. In addition, these suppliers have the ability to handle the volume of product we require. If any of these suppliers experienced financial or other difficulties, we could experience disruptions in our product flow until we obtained alternate suppliers, which could be lengthy due to the longer lead time required for sourced wood furniture from Asian manufacturers. 
 We use an all-import model for our wood furniture primarily to remain competitive for these products. The prices we paid for these imported products, including associated transportation costs, decreased slightly in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. We currently expect these prices and associated transportation costs to increase slightly in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Looking across our wholesale segments, imported finished goods represented 8% of our consolidated sales in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.

     Seasonal Business 
 We believe that the demand for furniture generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including consumer confidence, housing market conditions and unemployment rates. The table below shows our highest and lowest sales quarters based on historical experience, including fiscal 2017, by segment: 

Segment | Highest sales quarter | Lowest sales quarter
Upholstery | 4th | 1st 
Casegoods | 4th | 1st or 3rd 
Retail | 3rd | 1st 


We schedule production to maintain consistent manufacturing activity throughout the year whenever possible. We typically shut down our domestic plants for one week each fiscal year to perform routine maintenance on our equipment. 
   Economic Cycle and Purchasing Cycle 
 Our sales are impacted by the overall growth of the furniture industry, which is primarily influenced by consumer discretionary spending and existing and new housing activity. In addition, consumer confidence, employment rates, and other factors could affect demand. Upholstered furniture has a shorter life cycle than casegoods furniture because upholstered furniture is typically more fashion and design-oriented, and is often purchased one or two pieces at a time. Casegoods products, in contrast, are longer-lived and frequently purchased in groupings or "suites," resulting in a much larger cost to the consumer. As a result, casegoods sales are more sensitive to economic conditions, and upholstered furniture normally exhibits a less volatile sales pattern over an economic cycle. 
 Practices Regarding Working Capital Items 
 The following describes our significant practices regarding working capital items. 
  Inventory:    For our upholstery segment, we maintain raw materials and work-in-process inventory at our manufacturing locations. Finished goods inventory is maintained at our six regional distribution centers as well as our manufacturing locations. Our regional distribution centers allow us to streamline the warehousing and distribution processes for our La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network, including both company-owned stores and independently-owned stores. Our regional distribution centers also allow us to reduce the number of individual warehouses needed to supply our retail outlets and help us reduce inventory levels at our manufacturing and retail locations. 
 For our Casegoods segment, we import wood furniture from Asian vendors, resulting in long lead times on these products. To address these long lead times and meet our customers' delivery requirements, we maintain higher levels of finished goods inventory in our domestic warehouses, as a percentage of sales, of our casegoods products than our upholstery products. 
 Our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores maintain finished goods inventory at the stores for display purposes. 
 Our inventory remained flat in dollars and as a percent of sales during fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. We will continue to manage our inventory levels to ensure they are appropriate relative to our sales, while maintaining our focus on service to our customers. 
  Accounts Receivable:    During fiscal 2017, our accounts receivable increased $4.3 million compared with fiscal 2016, or 0.3 percentage points as a percent of sales. This increase was mostly attributable to the timing of sales in our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter occurring late in the quarter as compared with the 
 6

   fourth quarter sales in the prior fiscal year. We monitor our customers' accounts and limit our credit exposure to certain independent dealers, and strive to decrease our days' sales outstanding where possible. Our days' sales outstanding is a measure of the time needed to collect outstanding accounts receivable once we have completed a sale. Our days' sales outstanding decreased by approximately two days during fiscal 2017. 
  Accounts Payable:    During fiscal 2017, our accounts payable increased $6.6 million compared with fiscal 2016, or 0.4 percentage points as a percent of sales. This increase in accounts payable is primarily due to our third quarter fiscal 2017 acquisition of the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 
   Customers 
 Our wholesale customers are furniture retailers located primarily throughout the United States and Canada. Sales in our Upholstery and Casegoods segments are almost entirely to furniture retailers, but we also sell directly to end consumers through our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores that make up our Retail segment. 
 We have formal agreements with many furniture retailers for them to display and merchandise products from one or more of our operating units and sell them to consumers in dedicated retail space, either in stand-alone stores or dedicated proprietary galleries or studios within their stores. We consider this dedicated space to be "proprietary." For our Upholstery and Casegoods segments, our fiscal 2017 customer mix based on sales was 58% proprietary, 15% major dealers such as Art Van Furniture, Nebraska Furniture Mart and Slumberland Furniture, and 27% other independent retailers. 
 The success of our product distribution model relies heavily on having retail floor space that is dedicated to displaying and marketing our products. The 347-store La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® network is central to this approach. In addition, we sell product through proprietary space within other retail furniture stores, primarily La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, and Kincaid Shoppes. 
 Maintaining, updating, and, when appropriate, expanding our proprietary distribution network is a key part of our overall sales and marketing strategy. Our 4-4-5 initiative, through which we plan to expand the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores network to 400 stores averaging $4 million in sales per store over the five-year period that began with fiscal 2014, is a key growth strategy for us. With improved store performance we believe the network may deliver our targeted economic value over time with fewer stores. We now expect the build-out of our store network to extend beyond five years. Also, through this initiative, we intend not only to increase the number of stores in the network but also to improve their quality, including upgrading old format stores to our new concept design through remodels and relocations. At the end of fiscal 2017, less than seven percent of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores in the network were in the old format. As we continue to maintain and update our current stores to improve the quality of the network, the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network plans to open, relocate or remodel 25 to 30 stores during fiscal 2018, all of which will feature the new concept store design. 
 We select independent dealers for our proprietary La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network based on factors such as their management and financial qualifications and the potential for distribution in specific geographical areas. This proprietary distribution benefits La-Z-Boy, our dealers and our consumers. It enables La-Z-Boy to concentrate our marketing with sales personnel dedicated to our entire product line, and only that line and approved accessories. It allows dealers who join this proprietary group to take advantage of best practices with which other proprietary dealers have succeeded, and we facilitate forums for these dealers to share best practices. These La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores provide our consumers a full-service shopping experience with a large variety of products, knowledgeable sales associates, and design service consultants.

     Orders and Backlog 
 We typically build upholstery units based on specific dealer orders, either for dealer stock or to fill consumers' custom orders. We import casegoods product primarily to fill our internal orders, rather than customer or consumer orders, resulting in higher finished goods inventory on hand as a percentage of sales. Because the size of our backlog at a given time may not be indicative of our future sales, we do not rely entirely on backlogs to predict future sales. 
 Our Upholstery segment backlogs as of April 29, 2017, and April 30, 2016, were approximately $45.1 million and $50.8 million, respectively, and our Casegoods segment backlogs were approximately $6.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively. Our Upholstery segment backlog for fiscal 2017 declined compared with the prior year due to supply chain efficiencies that have improved our shipping performance, and our Casegoods segment backlog for fiscal 2017 was lower than the prior year due to being in a better in-stock position at April 29, 2017. 
   Competitive Conditions 
 We are the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential (living and family room, bedroom, and dining room) furniture in the United States, as measured by annual sales volume. 
 Alternative distribution channels have increasingly affected our retail markets. Furniture companies that operate primarily online, such as JoyBird and Article, or that have developed a product that can be shipped more easily than traditional upholstered furniture, have increased competition for our products. The increased ability of consumers to purchase furniture through various furniture manufacturers' and retailers' internet websites, including companies such as Amazon, QVC, and Wayfair, which operate with lower overhead costs than a brick-and-mortar retailer, has also increased competition in the industry. Companies such as Costco, Home Depot, IKEA, Sam's Club, Target, Wal-Mart, and others, also offer products that compete with some of our product lines. 
 The home furnishings industry competes primarily on the basis of product styling and quality, customer service (product availability and delivery), price, and location. We compete primarily by emphasizing our brand and the value, comfort, quality, and styling of our products. In addition, we remain committed to innovation while striving to provide outstanding customer service, exceptional dealer support, and efficient on-time delivery. Maintaining, updating, and expanding our proprietary distribution system, including identifying desirable retail locations, is a key strategic initiative for us in striving to remain competitive. We compete in the mid-to-upper-mid price point, and a shift in consumer taste and trends to lower priced products could negatively affect our competitive position. 
 In the Upholstery segment, our largest competitors are Ashley, Bassett, Bernhardt, Best Chair, Ethan Allen, Flexsteel, Heritage Home Group, Klaussner, Man Wah, and Natuzzi. 
 In the Casegoods segment, our main competitors are Bassett, Bernhardt, Ethan Allen, Heritage Home Group, Hooker Furniture, Lacquer Craft, and Stanley Furniture. The Casegoods segment faces additional market pressures from foreign manufacturers entering the United States market and increased direct purchases from foreign suppliers by large United States retailers. 
 The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores operate in the retail furniture industry throughout North America, and different stores have different competitors based on their geographic locations. Competitors include: Arhaus, Ashley, Bassett Furniture Direct, Crate and Barrel, Ethan Allen, Restoration Hardware, Thomasville Home Furnishings Stores, Williams-Sonoma, several other regional competitors (for example Art Van Furniture, Raymour & Flanigan Furniture, and Slumberland Furniture), and family-owned independent furniture stores. 
 In addition to the larger competitors listed above, a substantial number of small and medium-sized companies operate within our business segments, all of which are highly competitive.

     Research and Development Activities 
 We remain committed to innovation, with construction currently underway on our new state-of-the-art Innovation Center located in Dayton, Tennessee. This new facility will replace our existing structure and house a model shop, technology center, test lab, and three-dimensional printing lab. This new Innovation Center will help us continue to develop new products to meet our customers' needs. 
 We provide additional information regarding our research and development activities in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report. 
   Trademarks, Licenses and Patents 
 We own several trademarks, including the La-Z-Boy trademark, which is essential to the Upholstery and Retail segments of our business. To protect our trademarks, we have registered them in the United States and various other countries where our products are sold. These trademarks have a perpetual life, subject to renewal. We license the use of the La-Z-Boy trademark to our major international partners and dealers outside of North America. We also license the use of the La-Z-Boy trademark on contract office furniture, outdoor furniture, and non-furniture products, and these arrangements enhance our brand awareness, broaden the perceptions of La-Z-Boy, and create visibility of the La-Z-Boy brand in channels outside of the residential furniture industry. In addition, we license to our branded dealers the right to use our La-Z-Boy trademark in connection with the sale of our products and related services, on their signs, and in other ways, which we consider to be a key part of our marketing strategies. We provide more information about those dealers, under "Customers." 
 We hold a number of patents that we actively enforce, but we believe that the loss of any single patent or group of patents would not significantly affect our business. 
   Compliance with Environmental Regulations 
 Our manufacturing operations involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws, and we are involved in a small number of remediation actions and site investigations concerning these substances. Based on a review of all currently known facts and our experience with previous environmental matters, we currently do not believe it is probable that we will have any additional loss for environmental matters that would be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Employees 
 We employed approximately 8,950 full-time equivalent employees as of April 29, 2017, compared with 8,700 employees at the end of fiscal 2016. We employed approximately 7,200 in our Upholstery segment, 200 in our Casegoods segment, 1,300 in our Retail segment, and the remaining employees as corporate personnel. Our employment growth during fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to the new and acquired La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores in our Retail segment. We employ the majority of our employees on a full-time basis except in our Retail segment, where many of our employees are part-time. 
 Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 
 In fiscal 2017, our direct export sales, including sales in Canada, were approximately 11% of our total sales. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we acquired the La-Z-Boy wholesale business in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Prior to this acquisition, we were capturing approximately half the sales volume from this operation with the licensing agreement that was in place, and we are now in a position to realize the full value of this business. We are part of a manufacturing joint venture in Thailand which distributes furniture in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and other countries in Asia. We also 
 9

   participate in a sales and marketing joint venture in Asia, which sells and distributes furniture in Korea, Taiwan, Japan, India, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. In addition, our global trading company in Hong Kong continues to enhance our ability to source products and materials from our Asian suppliers, and provides quality assurance and logistics expertise. 
 We operate a facility in Mexico which produces cut-and-sewn fabric sets for our domestic upholstery manufacturing facilities. We provide information on sales in the United States, Canada, and other countries in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report. Our net property, plant, and equipment value in the United States was $161.6 million and $164.2 million at the end of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Our net property, plant, and equipment value in foreign countries was $7.5 million and $7.4 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. 
 See Item 1A of this report for information about the risks related to our foreign operations.
