  ﻿
 In June 2016, we began operating the ship-based casino onboard the Mein Schiff 5, a new 2,500 passenger cruise ship, and the TUI Discovery, a 2,067 passenger cruise ship. Under an amended concession agreement with TUI Cruises, we also plan to operate the ship-based casino onboard Mein Schiff 6, a new 2,500 passenger cruise ship scheduled to begin operations in the third quarter of 2017.
 ﻿
 Under a concession agreement with Diamond, we began operating the ship-based casino onboard Glory Sea, a 1,200 passenger cruise ship, in July 2016. Glory Sea operates in the Chinese cruise market with four-day trips between China, South Korea and Japan. In connection with the operation of the ship-based casino onboard Glory Sea, we also entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Dynamic Partners International, Ltd. (“Dynamic”) in July 2016. Under this agreement, Dynamic markets and promotes the casino to VIP players along with facilitating our concession agreement with Diamond, for which we pay Dynamic 25% to 40% of the net profit from the Glory Sea casino.
 ﻿
 In March 2015, we mutually agreed with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (“Norwegian”) to terminate our concession agreements with Oceania Cruises (“Oceania”) and Regent Seven Seas Cruises (“Regent”), indirect subsidiaries of Norwegian, effective June 1, 2015 (the “Termination Agreement”). We transitioned operations of the eight ship-based casinos that we operated onboard Oceania and Regent vessels to Norwegian in the second quarter of 2015. As consideration for the early termination of the concession agreements, we received $4.0 million in June 2015, which we recorded on our consolidated statement of earnings (loss) under operating revenue net of $0.6 million in assets that were sold to Norwegian as part of the Termination Agreement.

 In March 2015, we also entered into a two-year consulting agreement with Norwegian, which became effective June 1, 2015, under which we are providing limited consulting services for the ship-based casinos of Oceania and Regent in exchange for receiving a consulting fee of $2.0 million, which is payable $250,000 per quarter through the second quarter of 2017.

Additional Projects and Other Developments
 ﻿
 In September 2016, we were selected by Horse Racing Alberta (“HRA”) as the successful applicant to own, build and operate a horse racing facility in the Edmonton market area, which we are planning to operate as Century Mile. Century Mile will be a one-mile horse racetrack and a multi-level REC. The proposed location is on Edmonton International Airport land and close to the city of Leduc, south of Edmonton. Century Mile will be approximately 30 miles from both the Century Casino & Hotel in Edmonton and Century Casino St. Albert. We estimate that this project will cost approximately CAD 50.0 million ($37.2 million based on the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2016) and construction will take approximately 15 months to complete. Commencement of construction of the Century Mile project is subject to, among other things, our obtaining financing and the receipt of further regulatory and governmental approvals, including but not limited to approval by the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (“AGLC”).    ﻿
 We are planning a restoration and expansion project at the historic Palace Hotel that we own in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which will add 32 hotel rooms, an atrium, a coffee shop and a fitness room to the property. We estimate that this project will cost approximately $6.5 million and will be completed in early 2018. Commencement of construction of the Palace Hotel project is subject to our obtaining financing, which we are currently negotiating.
 ﻿
 We have additional potential gaming projects that we are currently exploring. Along with the capital needs of potential projects, there are various other risks which, if they materialize, could affect our ability to complete a proposed project or could eliminate its feasibility altogether. For more information on these and other risks related to our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” below.    ﻿

Capital Needs, Uses and Cash Flow
 ﻿

As a gaming company, our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our casinos. Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our industry is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow to maintain operations, fund reinvestment in existing properties for both refurbishment and expansion projects, repay third party debt, and pursue additional growth via new development and acquisition opportunities. When necessary and available, we supplement the cash flows generated by our operations with either cash on hand or funds provided by bank borrowings or other debt or equity financing.

 Marketing and Competition
 ﻿

We face intense competition from other casinos in jurisdictions in which we operate and destination resorts. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do. We seek to compete through promotion of our players’ clubs, enhancement of social networking initiatives and other marketing efforts. In addition to our players’ clubs, we also have various cash and prize promotions and market our casinos through a variety of media outlets including internet, television, radio, print and billboard advertising. Our marketing focuses on competition and other facts and circumstances of each market area in which we operate. Our primary marketing strategy centers on attracting new customers and rewarding repeat customers through our players’ club programs. All visitors to our properties are offered the opportunity to join our players’ club. We maintain a proprietary database that consists primarily of slot machine customers that allows us to create effective targeted marketing and promotional programs, cash and merchandise giveaways, coupons, downloadable promotional credits, preferred parking, food, lodging, game tournaments and other special events. Our players’ club cards allow us to update our database and track member gaming preferences, including, but not limited to, maximum, minimum, and total amounts wagered and frequency of visits. We have designed a multi-tiered reward program based on total amount wagered and frequency of visits to reward customer loyalty and attract new customers to our properties. Those who qualify for VIP status receive additional benefits compared to regular club membership, such as invitations to exclusive VIP events.    ﻿

 Canada

· | Edmonton - The Century Casino & Hotel in Edmonton, Canada and Century Casino St. Albert have six competitors (five casinos and one REC) in the Edmonton market, including a new casino that opened in downtown Edmonton that has increased competition in the market. The distance between our properties is approximately 13 miles. We do not believe that our properties compete against one another for customers.

§ | Century Casino & Hotel in Edmonton – This property is one of two casinos in Edmonton that have both a hotel and showrooms. The property’s showrooms allow us to attract customers to the casino through live music concerts, private concerts, comedic performances, catering and banquet events. In addition, the property is the only casino in the Edmonton market to offer a heated parking garage. Our main marketing activity focuses on branding the casino, through various forms of media, as the ultimate entertainment destination and as a provider of a sophisticated, interactive and intimate gaming experience. The casino is located in a densely populated area with the closest competing casino approximately six miles away.

· | Calgary - Century Casino Calgary and Century Downs have six competitors (two of which have a combination of hotel and casino) in the Calgary market. Both of our casinos have off-track betting parlors, and there is only one other casino in the Calgary market with an off-track betting parlor. The distance between our properties is 17 miles. We do not believe that our properties compete against one another for customers.

  ﻿

§ | Century Casino Calgary – Unique to this property is a 30-lane bowling alley, a lounge and two showrooms.

 United States
 Cripple Creek, Central City and Black Hawk are the only three cities in Colorado that allow gaming, exclusive of two Native American gaming operations in southwestern Colorado. Cripple Creek, located approximately 45 miles southwest of Colorado Springs, and Central City and Black Hawk, located approximately 35 miles west of Denver, are historic mining towns dating back to the late 1800’s that have developed into tourist attractions. As of December 31, 2016, there were 12 active casino licensees operating in Cripple Creek, 6 active casino licensees operating in Central City and 17 active casino licensees operating in Black Hawk. Unlike other regions in which we operate, gaming in Colorado is “limited stakes,” which restricts any single wager to a current maximum of one hundred dollars. 
 ﻿

The cities of Central City and Black Hawk are adjoining small mountain tourist towns, located approximately one mile apart. Central City and Black Hawk compete with one another for market share, and we view the two cities as one combined market servicing the Denver area. Black Hawk, which we believe does not maintain the same rigorous historical preservation standards as Central City, has been able to successfully attract major casino industry leaders with the ability to offer larger hotels, upscale dining facilities, performance centers and spa facilities. The casino operations in Black Hawk constitute a significant portion of the overall casino gaming market in Colorado (exclusive of the Native American gaming operations), with 59% of the total gaming devices in Colorado in 2016 and approximately 75% of total gaming revenues in Colorado in 2016.
 ﻿

Management believes that an integral component in attracting gaming patrons to our Colorado casinos is the availability of adequate, nearby parking and lodging. At our Cripple Creek property, we presently own a total of 271 surface parking spaces. We believe we have sufficient close proximity parking. However, covered parking garages provided by four of our competitors in Cripple Creek may negatively impact our casino, particularly during inclement weather. Our casino in Central City has a 500-space covered parking garage offering free public parking. Several other casinos in the Central City/Black Hawk market also have covered parking garages. In addition, three of our competitors in the Cripple Creek market and five of our competitors in the Central City and Black Hawk market have more hotel rooms, providing them with an advantage during inclement weather and the peak tourist season. 
 ﻿
 Our marketing objective for the casinos in Colorado is to create public awareness by positioning our casinos as the premier provider of personal service, convenient parking, the latest gaming products and superior food. In addition to our players’ clubs, we also have various cash and prize promotions and market our casinos through a variety of channels including radio, billboard, print and social media. 
 ﻿
 Poland
 CPL competes with 41 casinos located throughout Poland. The Polish government generally forbids the marketing of gaming activities outside of a casino, but the marketing of entertainment is permissible. Therefore, CPL’s marketing has focused on advertising the entertainment possibilities at each casino, such as concerts and parties. CPL also relies on the locations of its casinos, which are in major cities throughout Poland, to attract customers. The Polish government issues casino licenses in Poland by district, and there are additional casinos in each district in which CPL operates. For example, five other casinos in the Warsaw district compete with our Warsaw casinos. The Polish Minister of Finance does not disclose individual casino data. Changes to the Polish gaming law that go into effect in April 2017 legalize online gaming and reintroduce slot arcades through a state run company. These changes may result in increased competition for our casinos.

Corporate and Other

· | Cruise Ships – We have limited marketing opportunities on our ship-based casinos. We work jointly with the onboard revenue departments of the cruise lines on casino promotions and signage, which are in line with the cruise line’s guidelines. While we offer modern gaming products, we compete with other activities on the ship as well as onshore activities, including land-based casinos.

· | Aruba – The Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort & Casino, for which we hold the casino management agreement, has 12 competitors in the Aruba market. Our main marketing activity is focused on promotions to increase traffic at the casino with promotions such as mystery jackpots, players’ club rewards and various events at the casino, including live music and bingo. Marketing efforts are targeted to hotel guests staying at the Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort as well as tourists and locals from the island. The casino is located on the High Rise Strip on Palm Beach, which is the main tourist destination on the island.

Seasonality    ﻿
 Canada – Our Edmonton and Calgary casinos in Alberta, Canada attract more customers from September through April. During the remainder of the year, the casinos attract fewer customers because we compete with outdoor activities. Century Downs also attracts additional customers during the racing season from March through November. Century Bets attracts more customers to off-track betting parlors during the peak racing season from May through August.
 ﻿
 United States – Our casinos in Colorado attract more customers during the warmer months from May through September. We expect to attract fewer customers from October through April because weather conditions during this period are variable and can have a significant impact on daily business levels. 
 ﻿
 Poland – CPL generally attracts more customers from October through March because domestic customers generally vacation out of the country during the summer months. 
 ﻿
 Corporate and Other

· | Cruise Ships – Our business onboard cruise ships typically is not impacted by seasonality because the cruise ships generally operate year round. Our revenues from these operations fluctuate significantly with the volume and quality of the players onboard the ships. In addition, the cruise ships on which we conduct operations may be out of service from time to time for maintenance or based on the operating schedule of the cruise line, which may impact revenue from our cruise ship casinos.

· | Aruba – The Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort & Casino, for which we hold the management agreement, is popular among tourists throughout the year, with the peak season being from the end of December through April.

· | Argentina – The Mendoza market has a slight seasonal increase from January through March due to increased tourism.

Governmental Regulation and Licensing
 ﻿

The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state, local, foreign, provincial or federal regulations. We are required to obtain and maintain gaming licenses in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations. The limitation, conditioning, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of gaming licenses, or the failure to reauthorize gaming in certain jurisdictions, would materially adversely affect our gaming operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, changes in law that restrict or prohibit gaming operations in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 ﻿

Statutes and regulations can require us to meet various standards relating to, among other matters, business licenses, registration of employees, floor plans, background investigations of licensees and employees, historic preservation, building, fire and accessibility requirements, payment of gaming taxes, and regulations concerning equipment, machines, chips, gaming participants, and ownership interests. Civil and criminal penalties, including shutdowns or the loss of our ability to operate gaming facilities in a particular jurisdiction, can be assessed against us and/or our officers to the extent of their individual participation in, or association with, a violation of any of the state or local gaming statutes or regulations. Such laws and regulations apply in all jurisdictions in which we may do business. Management believes that we are in compliance with all applicable gaming and non-gaming regulations as described below.
 ﻿

Canada
 AGLC - Gaming in Alberta is governed by the provincial government. The AGLC administers and regulates the gaming industry in Alberta. The AGLC operates in accordance with the Gaming and Liquor Act, the Gaming and Liquor Regulation and the Criminal Code of Canada. 
 ﻿


 
11


The AGLC requires all gaming operations to be licensed but only allows a certain number of licenses to be granted. All available licenses have currently been granted and the AGLC has an indefinite moratorium on new casinos and RECs. If the AGLC increases the number of licenses available in the future, applicants for a gaming license must submit an application and run through a detailed approval process. Following the approval of the board of the AGLC, the applicant may operate the casino applied for in accordance with federal and provincial legislation, regulation, and policies as well as the municipal requirements, permits, licenses and authorization relating to the casino. At Edmonton and Calgary, our licenses must be renewed every five years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2018 for both casinos. At Century Downs and St. Albert, our licenses must be renewed every two years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2018. The AGLC monitors the casino operator and its compliance with all requirements. In the event of a violation of such requirements, civil and criminal charges can be assessed. 
 ﻿
 The AGLC allows casinos to operate slot machines and table games a daily maximum of 17 consecutive hours commencing at 10:00 a.m. and ending no later than 3:00 a.m. and to operate casino poker rooms 24 hours a day. Casinos and RECs may permit only individuals 18 or older to gamble in the casino. The AGLC permits slot machines, video lottery terminals, baccarat, blackjack, poker, craps and roulette with a maximum single bet of $2,000 and a maximum single bet of $5 for slot machines.    ﻿

The AGLC provides casinos with slot machines, slot technicians and personnel to administer table game counts. In return, casino licensees provide the AGLC with a place to operate slot machines, market the casinos, and provide table game dealers, slot attendants, security and surveillance. Casino licensees do not incur lease expenditures to the AGLC. In lieu of these lease expenses and other expenses associated with operating slot machines (i.e. equipment and personnel), casino licensees retain only a portion of net sales. Net sales, as defined by the AGLC, are calculated as cash played, less cash won, less the cost to lease the equipment, if applicable. At our Edmonton, St. Albert and Calgary casinos, the AGLC retains 85% of slot machine net sales, of which it allocates 15% to licensed charities and 70% to the Alberta Lottery Fund.  At Century Downs, the AGLC retains 35% of slot machine net sales through April 2017 and thereafter will retain 40% of net sales. AGLC allocates these funds to the Alberta Lottery Fund. For all table games, excluding poker and craps, we are required to allocate 50% of our net win to a charity designated by the AGLC. For poker and craps, we are required to allocate 25% of our net win to the charity. We record our revenue net of the amounts retained by the AGLC or allocated to the AGLC-designated charity or the Alberta Lottery Fund.

 HRA - HRA was formed in June 2002 to facilitate long term industry renewal for horse racing. The objectives of HRA are to govern, direct, control, regulate, manage, market and promote horse racing in any or all of its forms; to protect the health, safety and welfare of racehorses and, with respect to horse racing, the safety and welfare of racing participants and racing officials; and to safeguard the interest of the general public in horse racing.
 ﻿
 HRA requires all horse racing operators to be licensed. A licensed operator is responsible for the general supervision of horse races at its facilities but must not interfere with the proper performance of the functions and responsibilities of racing officials. Only individuals 18 or older may place a bet on horse races. HRA also prohibits racing officials, HRA employees, jockeys, drivers of horses and any employee of any of them from betting on a race, encouraging others to bet on a race on their behalf or owning a pari-mutuel ticket. A licensed owner of a horse, its trainer and any authorized agent or employee of such owner or trainer may not bet or encourage others to place a bet on their behalf on a horse other than the horse owned or trained by such licensed owner or trainer.
 ﻿
 A licensed operator must also provide and maintain a suitable racetrack, file with HRA a certificate of measurement of the track and provide services at race meetings, including first aid and ambulance facilities.  HRA must approve the equipment, facility and any services the operator will provide. HRA also requires a licensed operator to establish and maintain complete records of each horse race conducted by the operator.
 ﻿
 The HRA’s portion of slot machine net sales retained from Century Downs, which is currently 21.25% through April 2017 and thereafter will be 16.25%, is used to fund animal welfare programs, purses, breed improvement programs, marketing, and administration and backstretch programs. For off-track betting and live racing wagers, CDR retains approximately 21.5% of each bet, from which it will distribute 5.4% to the HRA, 0.8% to the Canadian Pari-Mutuel Agency and uses the remainder to pay expenses related to the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering.

 United States

The ownership and operation of gaming facilities in Colorado are subject to extensive state and local regulations. Licenses must be obtained from the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission (the “Gaming Commission”) prior to offering limited gaming to the public in the State of Colorado. In addition, the Division of Gaming (the “DOG”) within the Colorado Department of Revenue, licenses, implements, regulates, and supervises the conduct of limited stakes gaming. The Director of the DOG, under the supervision of the Gaming Commission, has been granted broad powers to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations. The Gaming Commission, DOG and DOG Director are collectively referred to as the “Colorado Gaming Authorities.”
 ﻿
 The laws, regulations, and internal control minimum procedures of the Colorado Gaming Authorities seek to maintain public confidence and trust that licensed limited gaming is conducted honestly and competitively, that the rights of the creditors of licensees are protected, and that gaming is free from criminal and corruptive elements. The Colorado Gaming Authorities’ stated policy is that public confidence and trust can be maintained only by strict regulation of all persons, locations, practices, associations, and activities related to the operation of the licensed gaming establishments and the manufacture and distribution of gaming devices and equipment. 
 ﻿

The Gaming Commission is empowered to issue six types of licenses. In order to operate a casino, an operator is required to obtain a retail gaming license. Further, under Colorado gaming regulations, no person or entity can have an ownership interest in more than three retail licenses. We currently operate under the maximum of three retail gaming licenses in Colorado (Century Casino & Hotel in Cripple Creek operates under two gaming licenses). Licenses must be renewed every two years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2017 for our casinos in Central City and Cripple Creek. In addition, the Gaming Commission has broad discretion to revoke, suspend, condition, limit or restrict the licensee at any time. The failure or inability of the Century Casino & Hotel in Central City or Cripple Creek, or the failure or inability of others associated with these casinos to maintain necessary gaming licenses or approvals would have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 ﻿

Our Colorado casinos must meet specified architectural requirements and must not exceed specified gaming square footage limits as a total of each floor and the full building. Colorado casinos may operate 24-hours a day, and may permit only individuals 21 or older to gamble in the casino. Colorado law permits slot machines, blackjack, poker, craps and roulette with a maximum single bet of $100. Colorado casinos may not provide credit to gaming patrons. 
 ﻿

The Colorado constitution permits a gaming tax of up to 40% on adjusted gross proceeds (“AGP”), and voter approval is required for any increase to this gaming tax rate.  The current gaming tax in Colorado established by the Gaming Commission is a graduated rate of 0.25% to 20% on AGP, where casinos pay a higher percentage as their AGP increase. 
 ﻿

Colorado law requires that every officer, director or stockholder holding a 5% or greater interest or controlling interest of a publicly traded corporation, or owner of an applicant or licensee, shall be a person of good moral character and submit to and pay the cost of a full background investigation conducted by the Gaming Commission. Persons found unsuitable by the Gaming Commission may be required to immediately terminate any interest in, association or agreement with, or relationship to, a gaming licensee. A finding of unsuitability with respect to any officer, director, employee, associate, lender or beneficial owner of a licensee or applicant may also jeopardize the licensee’s retail license or applicant’s license application. Licenses may, however, be conditioned upon termination of any relationship with unsuitable persons.

 We may not issue any voting securities except in accordance with the provisions of the Colorado Limited Gaming Act (the “Act”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The issuance of any voting securities in violation of the Act will be void, and the voting securities will be deemed not to be issued and outstanding. No voting securities may be transferred, except in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Any transfer in violation of these provisions will be void. If the Gaming Commission at any time determines that a holder in excess of 5% of our voting securities is unsuitable to hold the securities, then we may, within sixty (60) days after the finding of unsuitability, purchase the voting securities of the unsuitable person at the lesser of (a) the cash equivalent of such person’s investment, or (b) the current market price as of the date of the finding of unsuitability, unless such voting securities are transferred to a suitable person within sixty (60) days after the finding of unsuitability. Until our voting securities are owned by persons found by the Gaming Commission to be suitable to own them, (a) we are not permitted to pay any dividends or interest with regard to the voting securities, (b) the holder of such voting securities will not be entitled to vote, and the voting securities will not for any purposes be included in the voting securities entitled to vote, and (c) we may not pay any remuneration in any form to the holder of the voting securities, except in exchange for the voting securities.

 Poland

Gaming in Poland is governed by the Minister of Finance, who operates in accordance with Polish gaming law and has the authority to grant casino licenses. Polish gaming law was enacted in 1992. Key items included in Polish gaming law include the following requirements:
· | All slot arcades were phased out and ceased operations in 2015 and, effective in 2016, the operation of slot machines was permitted in casinos only; however, effective in April 2017, slot arcades will be reintroduced and operated through a state run company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A maximum of 70 slot machines are allowed per casino;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Licenses are not renewable, and licensees must reapply for a license once their current six year license has expired;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The gaming tax rate assessed on gross gaming revenue is 50%;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Poker cash games are prohibited in Poland, except for authorized poker tournaments; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Effective April 2017, online gaming will be permitted through a state run company. Current online gaming sites operating illegally will be blocked in Poland.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Casino licenses in Poland are limited to 52 and are subject to regional limitations. When a casino license expires, the Minister of Finance notifies the public of license availability, and those interested can submit an application. Applicants for a gaming license must complete a detailed approval process. Following approval from the Minister of Finance, the applicant may operate the casino for six years. The casino license for the Wroclaw casino expires in June 2017. In 2017, CPL submitted applications for multiple open licenses available throughout Poland, including in Wroclaw. We believe that CPL is likely to receive at least one of these casino licenses. The Minister of Finance monitors the casino operator and its compliance with all requirements. In the event of a violation, the Minister of Finance can assess charges and, in certain cases, withdraw casino licenses.    ﻿
 Corporate and Other

· | Cruise Ships -- The casinos onboard the cruise ships operate in international waters and are not regulated by any national or local regulatory body. However, we follow standardized rules and practices in the daily operation of the casinos.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Aruba -- The Minister of Justice governs gaming in Aruba. The Minister of Justice has the authority to grant a casino license, and a casino license will only be granted to the holder of a hotel license with a minimum of 250 rooms. As a result, the Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort & Casino, which has 355 hotel rooms, holds the casino license and we operate the casino under a management agreement. The casino must be a facility belonging to the hotel but separated from the normal hotel business matters. Gaming applicants must be in good standing and reputation as determined by the Minister of Justice. Games permitted include craps, bingo, keno, card games, roulette, wheel of fortune and slot machines. Casinos must be in compliance with conditions and rules and regulations set forth by the Minister of Justice, subject to penalties of closure, fines and/or withdrawal of license.

  ﻿

· | Argentina – The Casino de Mendoza is owned and operated by the Province of Mendoza. To retain the exclusive agreement with the IPJC, MCE must remain in good standing and operate ethically and without fault. In addition, any changes to the slot machines leased by MCE to Casino de Mendoza require approval from the IPJC.

 Other Regulation

We are subject to certain foreign, federal, state, provincial and local safety and health, employment and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to our non-gaming operations. We have not made, and do not anticipate making, material expenditures with respect to these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the coverage of, and attendant compliance costs associated with, such laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs to our operations.
 ﻿

Rules and regulations regarding the service of alcoholic beverages are strict. The loss or suspension of a liquor license could significantly impair our operations. Local building, parking and fire codes and similar regulations also could impact our operations and any proposed development of our properties.
 ﻿
 We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our business.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1,437 full-time employees and 354 part-time employees. During busier months, a casino may supplement its permanent staff with seasonal employees. Approximately 248 employees at our CPL casinos in Poland belong to trade unions. The trade unions do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with CPL, but changes in pay of union employees at CPL require approval of the unions.
