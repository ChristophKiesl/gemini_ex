     Item 1.  Business.
     (a)General Development of Business
     Liberty Interactive Corporation, formerly known as Liberty Media Corporation, ("Liberty", the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) owns interests in subsidiaries and other companies which are primarily engaged in the video and online commerce industries.  Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we operate in North America, Europe and Asia.  Our principal businesses and assets include our consolidated subsidiaries QVC, Inc. ("QVC"), zulily, llc (“zulily”) and Evite, Inc. (“Evite”) and our equity affiliates FTD Companies, Inc. (“FTD”), HSN, Inc. ("HSN"), LendingTree, Inc. (“LendingTree”) and Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”).
     On September 23, 2011, Liberty completed the split-off of a wholly owned subsidiary, Liberty Media Corporation ("LMC") (formerly known as Liberty CapStarz, Inc. and prior thereto known as Liberty Splitco, Inc.) (the "LMC Split-Off"). At the time of the LMC Split-Off, LMC owned all the assets, businesses and liabilities previously attributed to the Capital and Starz tracking stock groups. The LMC Split-Off was effected by means of a redemption of all of the Liberty Capital common stock and Liberty Starz common stock of Liberty in exchange for the common stock of LMC. Following the LMC Split-Off, Liberty and LMC operate as separately publicly traded companies and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other.
     On August 9, 2012, Liberty completed the approved recapitalization of its common stock through the creation of the Liberty Interactive common stock and Liberty Ventures common stock as tracking stocks. In the recapitalization, each holder of Liberty Interactive Corporation common stock remained a holder of the same amount and series of Liberty Interactive common stock and received 0.05 of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Ventures common stock, by means of a dividend, with cash issued in lieu of fractional shares of Liberty Ventures common stock.
     On October 3, 2014, Liberty reattributed from the Interactive Group to the Ventures Group approximately $1 billion in cash and its Digital Commerce businesses (as defined below), including Backcountry.com, Inc., Bodybuilding.com, LLC (“Bodybuilding”), CommerceHub, Inc. (then, Commerce Technologies, Inc.) (“CommerceHub”), Provide Commerce, Inc. (“Provide”), and Evite (collectively, the “Digital Commerce businesses”). Subsequent to the reattribution, the Interactive Group is now referred to as the QVC Group. The QVC Group has attributed to it Liberty’s wholly-owned subsidiaries QVC and zulily (as of October 1, 2015) and its approximate 38% interest in HSN, along with cash and certain liabilities. In connection with the reattribution, the Liberty Interactive tracking stock trading symbol “LINTA” was changed to "QVCA" and the "LINTB" trading symbol to "QVCB," effective October 7, 2014. Other than the issuance of Liberty Ventures shares in the fourth quarter of 2014, the reattribution of tracking stock groups has no consolidated impact on Liberty. Effective June 4, 2015, the name of the “Liberty Interactive common stock” was changed to the “QVC Group common stock.”
     Tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or "track" the economic performance of a particular business or "group," rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. Liberty has two tracking stocks, QVC Group common stock and Liberty Ventures common stock, which are intended to track and reflect the economic performance of the QVC Group and Ventures Group, respectively. While the QVC Group and the Ventures Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore no group can own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and are not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.
     On August 27, 2014, Liberty completed the spin-off to holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock shares of its former wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (“TripAdvisor Holdings”) (the “TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off”), which was effected as a pro-rata dividend of shares of TripAdvisor Holdings to the stockholders of Liberty’s Series A and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock. At the time of the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off, TripAdvisor Holdings was comprised of Liberty’s former 22% economic and 57% voting interest in TripAdvisor, Inc. 

 
  I-3

 
(“TripAdvisor”), as well as BuySeasons, Inc., Liberty’s former wholly-owned subsidiary, and a corporate level net debt balance of $350 million. Concurrently with TripAdvisor Holdings’ execution of certain margin loans in connection with the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off, Liberty and TripAdvisor Holdings entered into a promissory note that expires in 2017 pursuant to which TripAdvisor Holdings may request, if the closing price per share of TripAdvisor common stock were to fall below certain minimum values, up to $200 million in funds from Liberty. The TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off has been recorded at historical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution. Following the completion of the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off, Liberty and TripAdvisor Holdings operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. The consolidated financial statements of Liberty have been prepared to reflect TripAdvisor Holdings as discontinued operations. 
     On October 1, 2015, Liberty acquired zulily, inc. (now known as zulily, llc) for consideration of approximately $2.3 billion, comprised of $9.375 of cash and 0.3098 newly issued shares of Series A QVC Group common stock for each zulily share, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares. zulily is attributed to the QVC Group.  zulily is an online retailer offering customers a fun and entertaining shopping experience with a fresh selection of new product styles launched every day.  
     On May 18, 2016, Liberty completed a $2.4 billion investment in Liberty Broadband in connection with the merger of Charter Communications, Inc. ("Legacy Charter") and Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC"). The proceeds of this investment were used by Liberty Broadband to fund, in part, its acquisition of $5 billion of stock in the new public parent company (“Charter”) of the combined enterprises. Liberty, along with third party investors, all of whom invested on the same terms as Liberty, purchased newly issued shares of Liberty Broadband Series C common stock at a per share price of $56.23, which was determined based upon the fair value of Liberty Broadband's net assets on a sum-of-the parts basis at the time the investment agreements were executed. Liberty's investment in Liberty Broadband was funded using cash on hand and is attributed to the Ventures Group. See note 9 for additional information related to this investment.
 Liberty also exchanged, in a tax-free transaction, its shares of TWC common stock for shares of Charter Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis, and Liberty has granted to Liberty Broadband a proxy and a right of first refusal with respect to the shares of Charter Class A common stock held by Liberty in the exchange. 
 On July 22, 2016, Liberty completed its previously announced spin-off (the “CommerceHub Spin-Off”) of its former wholly-owned subsidiary CommerceHub. The CommerceHub Spin-Off was accomplished by the distribution by Liberty of a dividend of (i) 0.1 of a share of CommerceHub’s Series A common stock for each outstanding share of Liberty’s Series A Liberty Ventures common stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 8, 2016 (such date and time, the “Record Date”), (ii) 0.1 of a share of CommerceHub’s Series B common stock for each outstanding share of Liberty’s Series B Liberty Ventures common stock as of the Record Date and (iii) 0.2 of a share of CommerceHub’s Series C common stock for each outstanding share of Series A and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock as of the Record Date, in each case, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. This transaction has been recorded at historical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed its review of the CommerceHub Spin-Off and notified Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the CommerceHub Spin-Off. CommerceHub is included in the Corporate and other segment through July 22, 2016 and is not presented as a discontinued operation as the CommerceHub Spin-Off did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on Liberty’s operations and financial results.
 On November 4, 2016, Liberty completed its previously announced split-off (the “Expedia Holdings Split-Off”) of its former wholly-owned subsidiary Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. (“Expedia Holdings”). Expedia Holdings is comprised of, among other things, Liberty’s former interest in Expedia, Inc. (“Expedia”) and Liberty’s former wholly-owned subsidiary Bodybuilding. On November 2, 2016, Expedia Holdings borrowed $350 million under a new margin loan and distributed $299 million, net of certain debt related costs, to Liberty on November 4, 2016. The Expedia Holdings Split-Off was accomplished by the redemption of (i) 0.4 of each outstanding share of Liberty’s Series A Liberty Ventures common stock for 0.4 of a share of Expedia Holdings Series A common stock at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 4, 2016 (such date and time, the “Redemption Date”) and (ii) 0.4 of each outstanding share of Liberty’s Series B Liberty Ventures common stock for 0.4 of a share of Expedia Holdings Series B common stock on the Redemption Date, in each case, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Liberty Ventures common stock or Expedia Holdings common stock (after taking into account all of the shares owned of record by each holder thereof, as applicable). The IRS 

 
  I-4

 
completed its review of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and informed Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off.
 Liberty views Expedia and Bodybuilding as separate components and evaluated them separately for discontinued operations presentation. Based on a quantitative analysis, the split-off of Liberty’s interest in Expedia represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on Liberty’s operations, primarily due to prior year one-time gains on transactions recognized by Expedia. Accordingly, Liberty’s interest in Expedia is presented as a discontinued operation. The disposition of Bodybuilding as part of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off did not have a major effect on Liberty’s historical results nor is it expected to have a major effect on Liberty’s future operations. The disposition of Bodybuilding did not represent a strategic shift in Liberty’s operations. Accordingly, Bodybuilding is not presented as a discontinued operation.

      QVC
     QVC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, markets and sells a wide variety of consumer products primarily through live merchandise-focused televised shopping programs distributed to approximately 362 million worldwide households each day (including the joint venture in China as discussed below in further detail) and via its websites, including QVC.com, and other interactive media, such as mobile applications. The name, QVC, stands for "Quality, Value and Convenience," which is what QVC strives to deliver to its customers. QVC’s operating strategy is to create a premier multimedia lifestyle brand and shopping destination for its customers, further penetrate its core customer base, generate new customers, enhance programming distribution offerings and expand internationally to drive revenue and profitability. For the year ended 

 
  I-6

 
December 31, 2016, approximately 93% of its worldwide shipped sales were from repeat and reactivated customers (i.e., customers who made a purchase from QVC during the prior twelve months and customers who previously made a purchase from QVC but not during the prior twelve months). In the same period, QVC attracted approximately 3.1 million new customers. QVC’s global e-commerce operation comprised $4.0 billion, or 46%, of its consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
     QVC markets its products in an engaging, entertaining format primarily through merchandise-focused live television programs and interactive features on its websites and other interactive media.  In the United States (“U.S.”), QVC distributes its programming live 24 hours per day, 364 days per year and presents on average 770 products every week (such U.S. operations, “QVC-U.S”). Internationally, QVC distributes live programming 8 to 24 hours per day, depending on the market.  QVC classifies its products into six groups: home, apparel, beauty, accessories, jewelry and electronics.
    
 | Years ended December 31,
Product category | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
Home | 33% | 33% | 32% 
Apparel | 19% | 17% | 16% 
Beauty | 17% | 17% | 17% 
Accessories | 13% | 13% | 12% 
Jewelry | 9% | 10% | 12% 
Electronics | 9% | 10% | 11% 
Total | 100% | 100% | 100%

          Many of QVC's brands are exclusive, while others are created by well-known designers. It is QVC's product sourcing team's mission to research and locate compelling and differentiated products from manufacturers who have sufficient scale to meet anticipated demand. QVC offers many QVC-exclusive products, as well as popular brand name and lesser known products available from other retailers. Many of its products are endorsed by celebrities, designers and other well-known personalities who often join its presenters to personally promote their products and provide lead-in publicity on their own television shows. QVC believes that its ability to demonstrate product features and present “faces and places” differentiates and defines the QVC shopping experience. QVC closely monitors customer demand and its product mix to remain well-positioned and relevant in popular and growing retail segments, which QVC believes is a significant competitive advantage relative to competitors who operate brick-and-mortar stores.
     QVC does not depend on any single supplier or designer for a significant portion of its inventory purchases.
     Since its inception, QVC has shipped over 1.95 billion packages in the U.S. alone. QVC operates nine distribution centers and seven call centers worldwide. In the U.S., QVC is able to ship approximately 91% of its orders within two days of the order placement. Globally, QVC is able to ship approximately 93% of its orders within two days of the order placement. In 2016, QVC's work force of approximately 17,700 employees handled approximately 156 million customer calls, shipped approximately 183 million units globally and served approximately 13 million customers. QVC believes its long-term relationships with major U.S. television distributors, including cable operators (e.g., Comcast and Cox), satellite television providers (e.g., DISH Network and DIRECTV) and telecommunications companies (e.g., Verizon and AT&T (excluding DIRECTV)), provide it with broad distribution, favorable channel positioning and significant competitive advantages. QVC believes that its significant market share, brand awareness, outstanding customer service, repeat customer base, international reach and scalable infrastructure distinguishes QVC from its competitors.
     QVC-U.S.'s live televised shopping programs are distributed nationally, 24 hours per day, 364 days per year, to approximately 104 million television households. QVC distributes its programming to approximately 96% of television households subscribing to services offered by television distributors. QVC-U.S. programming is also available on QVC.com, its U.S. website, and mobile applications via streaming video; over-the air broadcasters in 93 markets; and the Roku platform. QVC-U.S., including QVC.com, contributed $6.1 billion, or 70.5%, of consolidated net revenue, $915 million of operating income and $1.4 billion of Adjusted OIBDA (defined in Part II, Item 7 of this report) for the year ended December 31, 2016.

 In March 2013, QVC-U.S. launched over-the-air broadcasting in designated U.S. markets that can be accessed by any television household with a digital antennae in such markets, regardless of whether it subscribes to a paid television service.  This allows QVC-U.S. to reach new customers who previously did not have access to the program through other television platforms.
 In August 2013, QVC-U.S. launched an additional channel, QVC Plus, which is being distributed through cable and satellite systems.  The channel allows viewers to have access to a broader range of QVC programming options as well as more relevant programming for viewers in differing time zones.
 In October 2016, QVC-U.S. launched another additional channel, Beauty iQ, which is being distributed through satellite and streaming platforms. The channel and supporting platforms are dedicated to a complete beauty shopping experience for customers.
 QVC established QVC-U.S. as the televised shopping leader after building a track record of outstanding quality and customer service, establishing favorable channel positioning and generating repeat business from its core customer base.  QVC estimates its share of the U.S. televised shopping revenue in 2016, among QVC-U.S. and its two primary televised shopping competitors HSN and EVINE Live Inc. ("EVINE Live") to be approximately two-thirds. QVC believes QVC-U.S. also compares favorably in terms of sales to general, non-television based retailers due to its extensive customer reach and efficient cost structure.
 QVC.com, launched in 1996, complements QVC-U.S.'s televised shopping programs by allowing consumers to purchase a wide assortment of goods offered on its televised programs, as well as other products that are available only on QVC.com. QVC views e-commerce (QVC.com and mobile devices) as a natural extension of its business, allowing it to stream live video and offer on-demand video segments of items recently presented live on its televised programs. QVC.com allows shoppers to browse, research, compare and perform targeted searches for products, control the order‑entry process and conveniently access their QVC account. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 76% of new U.S. customers made their first purchase through QVC.com (including mobile).
 QVC's televised shopping programs reached approximately 137 million television households outside of the U.S., primarily in Germany, Austria, Japan, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), the Republic of Ireland, Italy and France. In addition, QVC's joint venture in China reached approximately 121 million homes. The programming created for most of these markets is also available via streaming video on its international websites and mobile applications. QVC's international business employs product sourcing teams who select products tailored to the interests of each local market. For the year ended December 31, 2016, QVC's international operations generated $2.6 billion, or 29.5%, of consolidated net revenue, $289 million of operating income and $405 million of Adjusted OIBDA and QVC's international websites generated $854 million, or 33.3%, of its total international net revenue.
 On July 4, 2012, QVC entered into a joint venture with Beijing‑based CNR Media Group, formerly known as China Broadcasting Corporation, a limited liability company owned by China National Radio (“CNR”), China's government‑owned radio division. The joint venture, CNR Home Shopping Co., Ltd. (“CNRS”), is owned 49% by QVC and 51% by CNR through subsidiaries of each company. CNRS operates a retailing business in China through a shopping television channel with an associated website. This joint venture combines CNRS's knowledge of the digital shopping market and consumers in China with QVC's global experience and know-how in multimedia retailing. CNRS distributes live programming for 15 hours each day and recorded programming for nine hours each day. The CNRS joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment.
 QVC distributes its television programs, via satellite and optical fiber, to cable television and/or direct-to-home satellite system operators for retransmission to their subscribers in the U.S., Germany, Japan, the U.K., Italy, France and neighboring countries. QVC also transmits its television programs over digital terrestrial broadcast television to viewers throughout Italy, the U.K. and to viewers in certain geographic regions in the U.S. and Germany. In the U.S., QVC uplinks its analog and digital programming transmissions using a third-party service. Both transmissions are uplinked to protected, non-preemptible transponders on U.S. satellites. "Protected" status means that, in the event of a transponder failure, the signal will be transferred to a spare transponder or, if none is available, to a preemptible transponder located on the same satellite or, in certain cases, to a transponder on another satellite owned by the same service provider if one is available at the time of the failure. "Non-preemptible" status means that, in the event of a transponder failure, QVC's transponders cannot be preempted in favor of a user of a failed transponder, even another user with "protected status." The international 

 
  I-8

 
business units each obtain uplinking services from third parties and transmit their programming to non-preemptible transponders on international satellites. The transponder service agreements for the U.S. transponders expire at the earlier of the end of the lives of the satellites or the service agreements. The service agreements in the U.S. expire between 2019 and 2023. The transponder service agreements for the international transponders expire between 2019 and 2024.
 QVC continually seeks to expand and enhance its television and e-commerce platforms, as well as to further its international operations and multimedia capabilities. QVC launched QVCHD in the U.S. in April 2008, and in May 2009, became the first U.S. multimedia retailer to offer a native high definition (“HD”) service. QVCHD is a HD simulcast of QVC's U.S. telecast utilizing the full 16x9 screen ratio, while keeping the side panel for additional information. HD programming allows QVC to utilize a typically wider television screen with crisper and more colorful images to present a larger “storefront,” which QVC believes captures the attention of channel “surfers” and engages its customers. In the U.S., QVCHD reaches approximately 80 million television households. QVC continues to develop and launch features to further enrich the television viewing experience.
 Beyond the main live programming QVC channels, including QVCHD, in the U.S., Germany and the U.K. also broadcast pre-recorded and live shows on additional channels that offer viewers access to a broader range of QVC programming options. These channels include QVC Plus and Beauty iQ in the U.S., QVC Beauty & Style and QVC Plus in Germany, and QVC Beauty, QVC Extra, QVC Style and QVC +1 in the U.K.
 QVC enters into long-term affiliation agreements with certain of its television distributors who downlink its programming and distribute the programming to customers.  QVC's affiliation agreements with both domestic and international distributors have termination dates ranging from 2017 to 2027. QVC's ability to continue to sell products to its customers is dependent on its ability to maintain and renew these affiliation agreements in the future. Although QVC is typically successful in obtaining and renewing these agreements, it does not have distribution agreements with some of the distributors that carry its programming. In total, QVC is currently providing programming without affiliation agreements to distributors representing approximately 10% of its U.S. distribution, and short-term, rolling 90 day letters of extension, to distributors who represent approximately 27% of its U.S. distribution. Some of its international programming may continue to be carried by distributors after the expiration dates on its affiliation agreements with such distributors have passed.
     In return for carrying QVC's signals, each programming distributor in the U.S. receives an allocated portion, based upon market share, of up to 5% of the net sales of merchandise sold via the television programs and from certain Internet sales to customers located in the programming distributor's service areas. Internationally, programming distributors predominately receive an agreed-upon annual fee, a monthly or yearly fee per subscriber regardless of the net sales, a variable percentage of net sales or some combination of the above arrangements.
     In addition to sales-based commissions or per-subscriber fees, QVC also makes payments to distributors primarily in the U.S. for carriage and to secure positioning within a broadcast area or within the general entertainment area on the distributor's channel line-up.  QVC believes that a portion of its sales are attributable to purchases resulting from channel “surfing” and that a channel position near broadcast networks and more popular cable networks increases the likelihood of such purchases. As technology evolves, QVC will continue to monitor optimal channel placement and attempt to negotiate agreements with its distributors to maximize the viewership of its television programming.
     QVC enjoys a very loyal customer base, as demonstrated by the fact that for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately 87% of its worldwide shipped sales came from repeat customers (i.e., customers who made a purchase from QVC during the prior twelve months), who spent an average of $1,247 each during this period. An additional 6% of shipped sales in that period came from reactivated customers (i.e., customers who previously made a purchase from QVC, but not during the prior twelve months).
 Customer growth was essentially flat in 2016. On a trailing twelve month basis, total consolidated customers (excluding the joint venture in China) were approximately 12.7 million, which includes approximately 8.1 million in the U.S. and approximately 4.6 million internationally. QVC believes its core customer base represents an attractive demographic target market. Based on internal customer data, approximately 53% of its more than 8.1 million U.S. customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were women between the ages of 35 and 64.

 QVC strives to be prompt and efficient in order taking and fulfillment. QVC has two domestic phone centers, located in San Antonio, Texas and Chesapeake, Virginia, that can direct calls from one call center to the other as volume mandates. Internationally, QVC also has one phone center in each of Japan, the U.K. and Italy, and two call centers in Germany. For France, order taking is handled by a third party located in Portugal. Many markets also utilize home agents to handle calls, allowing staffing flexibility for peak hours. In addition, QVC utilizes computerized voice response units, which handle approximately 26% of all orders taken on a worldwide basis.
 In addition to taking orders from its customers through phone centers and online, QVC continues to expand its ordering platforms. QVC is expanding mobile device ordering capabilities and over the past several years has launched iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Android, Blackberry and Apple TV applications, a WAP (wireless application protocol) mobile website and a robust SMS (short message services) program. On a global basis, customers placed approximately 28% of all orders directly through their mobile devices in 2016.
 Through QVC's nine worldwide distribution centers, QVC shipped approximately 93% of its orders within two days of the order placement in 2016. QVC's domestic distribution centers are located in Suffolk, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Rocky Mount, North Carolina; Florence, South Carolina; and Ontario, California. QVC’s domestic distribution centers and dropship partners have shipped nearly 814,000 units and over 733,000 packages in a single day. QVC also has distribution centers in Sakura-shi, Chiba, Japan, Hücklehoven, Germany, Knowsley, U.K. and Castel San Giovanni, Italy.
 QVC has built a scalable operating infrastructure focused on sustaining efficient, flexible and cost-effective sale and distribution of its products. Since its physical store locations are minimal, QVC requires lower inventory levels and capital expenditures compared to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. In recent years, QVC has made significant investments in its distribution centers that it believes will accommodate its foreseeable growth needs. Further, since QVC has no set “floor plan” and can closely manage inventory levels at its centralized warehouses, QVC believes it has the flexibility to analyze and react quickly to changing trends and demand by shifting programming time and product mix. QVC's cost structure is highly variable, which QVC believes allows it to consistently achieve attractive margins relative to brick-and-mortar retailers.
 QVC's web and mobile platforms are fully integrated with its televised programming and product distribution capabilities. QVC's web and mobile platform features include a live video stream of its television programming, full integration with its order fulfillment and its product branding, as well as the thematic offerings and events that have become fundamental to its televised programming.
 Third party carriers transport QVC's packages from its distribution centers to its customers. In each market where QVC operates, it has negotiated long-term contracts with shipping companies, which in certain circumstances provides for favorable shipping rates.
 QVC operates in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment. Based on domestic net revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, QVC is the leading television retailer in the U.S. and generates substantially more net revenue than its two closest televised shopping competitors, HSN (an entity in which we have a 38% ownership interest as of December 31, 2016) and EVINE Live. QVC's international operations face similar competition in their respective markets, such as Shop Channel in Japan, HSE 24 in Germany and Italy, Ideal World in the U.K., and M6 Boutique in France.  Additionally, QVC has numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, wholesale clubs, discount retailers, infomercial retailers, Internet retailers, and mail-order and catalog companies.
     QVC also competes for access to customers and audience share with other providers of televised, online and hard copy entertainment and content. The price and availability of other programming and the conversion to digital programming platforms may unfavorably affect the placement of its programming in the channel line-ups of its distributors, and may affect its ability to obtain distribution agreements with small cable distributors. Competition from other programming also affects the compensation that must be paid to distributors for carriage, which continues to increase. Principal competitive factors for QVC include (i) value, quality and selection of merchandise; (ii) customer experience, including customer service and reliability of fulfillment and delivery services and (iii) convenience and accessibility of sales channels.

 QVC regards its trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to its success. QVC relies on a combination of trademark and copyright law, trade‑secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with its employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to protect these proprietary rights. QVC has registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities and vigorously protects its proprietary rights against infringement.
     Domestically, QVC has registered trademarks and service marks for a variety of items including, but not limited to its brand name, "QVC," "Quality Value Convenience," "Find What You Love, Love What You Find," the "Q QVC Ribbon Logo," "Q" and its proprietary products sold such as "Arte D'Oro", "Cook's Essentials", "Denim & Co.," "Diamonique," “Nature’s Code,” "Northern Nights" and "Ultrafine Silver."  Similarly, foreign registrations have been obtained for many trademarks and service marks for its brand name and propriety products including, but not limited to, "QVC" the "Q QVC Ribbon Logo," "Q," "Breezies," "Denim & Co.," "Diamonique" and "Northern Nights." QVC considers the service mark for the "QVC" name the most significant trademark or service mark held by it because of its impact on market awareness across all of its geographic markets and on customers' identification with QVC. As with all domestic trademarks or service marks, QVC's trademark and service mark registrations in the U.S. are for a ten year period and are renewable every ten years, prior to their respective expirations, as long as the trademarks or service marks are used in the regular course of trade.
     QVC's business is seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in the fourth calendar quarter related to year-end holiday shopping. In recent years, QVC has earned, on average, between 22% and 24% of its global revenue in each of the first three quarters of the year and between 30% and 32% of its global revenue in the fourth quarter of the year.
 zulily llc 
 On October 1, 2015, we acquired 100% of zulily. zulily is an online retailer offering customers a fun and entertaining shopping experience with a fresh selection of new product styles launched each day. The zulily website was launched in January 2010 with the goal of revolutionizing the way moms shop. Through its desktop and mobile websites and mobile applications, zulily helps its customers discover new and unique products at great values that they would likely not find elsewhere. zulily’s merchandise includes women’s, children’s and men’s apparel and other products such as home, beauty and personalized products. zulily sources its merchandise from thousands of vendors, including emerging brands and smaller boutique vendors, as well as larger national brands. By bringing together millions of customers and a daily selection of products chosen from its vendor base, zulily has built a large scale and uniquely curated marketplace.
 Every morning, zulily launches a variety of flash sales events. These events feature thousands of product styles from different vendors and typically last for 72 hours. The day’s events are kicked off by an early morning email to zulily’s email subscribers and “push” communication to users of zulily’s mobile applications. Offerings are typically only available for a limited time and in a limited quantity, creating urgency to browse and purchase. zulily’s products are sourced from a variety of vendors, ranging from smaller boutiques or emerging brands to larger, nationally known brands that appeal to its customers and draw new customers to its sites.
 Before zulily launches an event, zulily shoots or obtains photographs of the merchandise and its editorial team writes about the merchandise. The experience, creativity, resourcefulness and efficiency of zulily’s merchandising, creative and operations teams enable zulily to feature thousands of product styles each quarter. zulily works to create the most compelling price points for its customers, with the average item offered for significant discount off the manufacturer’s suggested or comparison retail price. zulily then uses its proprietary technology, data analytics and personalization tools to segment its audience, offering each customer a curated and optimized shopping experience that features brands, products and events that it believes are most relevant for that customer.
 zulily acquires new email subscribers through a diverse set of paid and unpaid marketing channels, including affiliate channels and partners, customer referrals, direct navigation, display advertising, key word search campaigns, search engine optimization, social media and television ads. Core to its business model is that zulily acquires customers once via paid and unpaid sources, and then drives engagement and repeat purchases from those customers over a long period of time through the sending of daily emails and mobile “push” communications. 

 
  I-11

 

 Continual innovation through investment in technology is core to zulily’s business. zulily uses its technology platform to improve the experience of its customers and vendors, increase the purchase frequency and average order size and optimize the efficiency of its business operations. zulily’s technology team is focused on rapid innovation through advanced agile software development processes. zulily’s scalable platform uses custom-built and third-party technologies to support its specific customer and vendor requirements, including handling significant spikes in site traffic and transactions on a daily basis, and the rapid and complex order supply chain needs that are unique to zulily’s flash sales and minimal inventory model. zulily believes it can quickly scale its infrastructure to accommodate significantly higher volumes of site traffic, customers, orders and the overall growth in its business.
 To best serve its customers and vendors, zulily has a custom, fully integrated fulfillment infrastructure consisting of receiving, sorting, inventory management and repackaging systems which are coordinated by proprietary fulfillment management software. zulily’s supply chain solution efficiently handles the small-to-medium lot sizes and high inventory turnover required by constantly changing, limited-time product offerings. zulily operates a minimal inventory, intermediary model where it typically takes customer orders before purchasing inventory from vendors. As a result, zulily is able to offer a much larger selection of products to customers and to generate greater sales for vendors, who are able to match a broader range of their product supply to actual customer demand.
 zulily views its target market broadly and competes with any retailer where its customers shop. It faces significant competition from both online and offline retailers, competing on: product curation and selection, personalization, value, convenience, ease of use, consumer experience, vendor satisfaction and shipping time and cost.     zulily relies on laws and regulations, contractual restrictions, copyrights, and trademarks to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights. zulily’s employees and contractors also typically enter into agreements to assign to zulily the inventions and content they produce in performing their jobs. zulily controls access to confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with its employees, contractors and third parties, such as vendors, service providers, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with zulily. Despite the protection of general intellectual property law and its contractual restrictions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use zulily’s intellectual property without zulily’s authorization.
 zulily has registered numerous Internet domain names related to its business. In addition, zulily pursues the registration of its trademarks in the U.S. and certain other locations outside of the U.S.; however, effective intellectual property protection or enforcement may not be available in every country in which zulily’s products and services are made available in the future. In the U.S. and certain other countries, zulily has registered or has applications pending for its key trademarks: zulily, the zulily design mark and the “Z” design associated with its mobile applications. 
 zulily’s results are impacted by a pattern of increased sales during the back-to-school shopping season in the third quarter and holiday shopping season in the fourth quarter, which it expects would result in lower sequential growth in the first quarter.  The fourth quarter accounted for approximately 30.2% and 31.3% of zulily’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Liberty obtained its ownership interest in FTD during December 2014 in a transaction whereby Liberty exchanged its former wholly-owned subsidiary Provide for cash and a 35% ownership interest in FTD. We owned approximately 37% of the outstanding common stock of FTD as of December 31, 2016. We have entered into an agreement with FTD pursuant to which, among other things, we have the right to proportional representation on FTD’s board of directors based on our ownership interest in FTD.  In connection with this transaction, FTD increased the size of its board of directors from seven to 11 directors. Liberty nominated the four additional directors to the board of directors. 
 HSN
 HSN became a separate public company in August 2008 in connection with the separation of IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”) into five separate companies.  HSN is an interactive multi-channel retailer that markets and sells a wide range of third party and proprietary merchandise directly to consumers through various platforms including (i) television home shopping programming broadcast on the HSN television networks and other direct-response television marketing; (ii) catalogs, consisting primarily of the Cornerstone portfolio of leading print catalogs which includes Ballard Designs, Frontgate, Garnet Hill, Grandin Road and Improvements; (iii) websites, which consist primarily of HSN.com, joymangano.com and the five branded websites operated by Cornerstone; (iv) mobile applications; (v) retail and outlet stores; and (vi) wholesale distribution of certain proprietary products to other retailers. Chasing Fireflies and TravelSmith, two of the apparel brands in the Cornerstone portfolio, were sold in September 2016.
 We own approximately 38% of the outstanding common stock of HSN.  We have entered into an agreement with HSN pursuant to which, among other things, we have the right to nominate 20% of the members of HSN's board of directors.  We have nominated two of the current 10 board members.
 LendingTree
 LendingTree was also spun off by IAC in August 2008. LendingTree is the owner of several brands and businesses that provide information, tools, advice, products and services for critical transactions in their customers' lives. LendingTree’s family of brands includes: LendingTree®, GetSmart®, DegreeTree®, LendingTreeAutos, DoneRight®, ServiceTree® and InsuranceTree®. Together, these brands serve as an ally for consumers who are looking to comparison shop for loans, home services, education, auto and other financial products from multiple business and professionals who compete for their business.  LendingTree is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.
 We own approximately 24% of the outstanding common stock of LendingTree.  We have entered into an agreement with LendingTree pursuant to which, among other things, we have the right to nominate 20% of the members of LendingTree’s board of directors.  We have nominated two of the seven current board members.
 Liberty Broadband Corporation
 Liberty Broadband was spun off by LMC in November 2014.  Liberty Broadband consists of its interest in Charter and its subsidiary Skyhook Holding, Inc. Charter is one of the largest providers of cable services in the U.S., offering a variety of entertainment, information and communications solutions to residential and commercial customers. Skyhook provides mobile positioning and contextual location intelligence solutions.
 In May 2016, Liberty completed a $2.4 billion investment in Liberty Broadband in connection with the merger of Legacy Charter and TWC. We own approximately 23% of the outstanding common stock of Liberty Broadband. Due to overlapping boards of directors and management, Liberty has been deemed to have significant influence over Liberty Broadband (for accounting purposes) even though Liberty does not have any voting rights. Liberty has elected to apply the fair value option for its investment in Liberty Broadband as it is believed that the Company’s investors value this investment based on the trading price of Liberty Broadband.

 Regulatory Matters 
 Programming and Interactive Television Services
 Although QVC, a wholly owned subsidiary, and HSN, a business affiliate, market and sell consumer products through a variety of outlets, each does so, in large part, through live video programming services distributed by cable television systems, satellite systems and over-the-air broadcasters.  Consequently, regulation of programming services and the entities that distribute them can affect QVC and HSN.  In the U.S., the FCC regulates broadcasters, the providers of satellite communications services and facilities for the transmission of programming services, the cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") that distribute such services, and, to some extent, the availability of the programming services themselves through its regulation of program licensing. Cable television systems in the U.S. are also regulated by municipalities or other state and local government authorities. Regulatory carriage requirements also could adversely affect the number of channels available to QVC and HSN.
     Regulation of Program Licensing. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (the “1992 Cable Act”) directed the FCC to promulgate regulations regarding the sale and acquisition of cable programming between MVPDs (including cable operators) and satellite-delivered programming services in which a cable operator has an attributable interest. The 1992 Cable Act and implementing regulations generally prohibit a cable operator that has an attributable interest in a satellite programmer from improperly influencing the terms and conditions of sale to unaffiliated MVPDs. Further, the 1992 Cable Act requires that such affiliated programmers make their programming services available to cable operators and competing MVPDs such as multi-channel multi-point distribution systems and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") distributors on terms and conditions that do not unfairly discriminate among distributors, and the FCC has established complaint enforcement and damages remedy procedures. FCC rules attribute the ownership interest in Charter of Liberty Broadband, and Liberty Global plc’s ownership interest in Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico, LLC to us, thereby subjecting us and satellite-delivered programming services in which we have an interest to the program access rules. We are also subject to the program access rules as a condition of FCC approval of Liberty’s transaction with News Corporation in 2008.
     In 2014, the FCC released a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on a proposal to revise the definition of MVPD in its rules to include services, such as Internet-based services, that make available for purchase by viewers, multiple linear streams of video programming, regardless of the technology used to distribute the programming.  If the FCC were to adopt its proposed definition and determine that the program access rules apply to such MVPDs, QVC and HSN potentially would be required to negotiate with, and license their programming services to, such MVPDs and to comply with other related regulatory requirements.
     Regulation of Carriage of Programming. Under the 1992 Cable Act, the FCC has adopted regulations prohibiting cable operators from requiring a financial interest in a programming service as a condition to carriage of such service, coercing exclusive rights in a programming service or favoring affiliated programmers so as to restrain unreasonably the ability of unaffiliated programmers to compete. The FCC has established program carriage complaint rules.
     Regulation of Ownership. The 1992 Cable Act required the FCC, among other things, (1) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of channels on a cable system that will be allowed to carry programming in which the owner of such cable system has an attributable interest and (2) to consider the necessity and appropriateness of imposing limitations on the degree to which MVPDs (including cable operators) may engage in the creation or production of video programming. Although the FCC adopted regulations limiting carriage by a cable operator, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) vacated the channel occupancy limits adopted by the FCC and remanded the rule to the FCC for further consideration in 2001. In response to the D.C. Circuit’s decision, the FCC issued further notices of proposed rulemaking in 2001 and in 2005 to consider channel occupancy limitations, but has not adopted any rules. 
     Regulation of Carriage of Broadcast Stations. The 1992 Cable Act granted broadcasters a choice of must carry rights or retransmission consent rights. The rules adopted by the FCC generally provided for mandatory carriage by cable systems of all local full-power commercial television broadcast signals selecting must carry rights and, depending on a cable system's channel capacity, non-commercial television broadcast signals. Such statutorily mandated carriage of broadcast 

 
  I-14

 
stations coupled with the provisions of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which require cable television systems with 36 or more "activated" channels to reserve a percentage of such channels for commercial use by unaffiliated third parties and permit franchise authorities to require the cable operator to provide channel capacity, equipment and facilities for public, educational and government access channels, could adversely affect QVC and HSN by limiting the carriage of such services in cable systems with limited channel capacity.
     Closed Captioning Regulation. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 also required the FCC to establish rules and an implementation schedule to ensure that video programming is fully accessible to the hearing impaired through closed captioning. The rules adopted by the FCC require substantial closed captioning, with only limited exemptions. In 2012, the FCC adopted regulations pursuant to the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 that require, among other things, video programming owners to send caption files for IP delivered video programming to video programming distributors and providers along with program files. In 2014, the FCC adopted closed captioning quality standards regarding captioning accuracy, synchronicity, completeness and placement, and captioning best practices for programmers. In 2016, the FCC amended its closed captioning regulations to assign captioning compliance responsibility to programmers jointly with distributors, and to adopt certain registration, certification and complaint procedures applicable to programmers. As a result of these captioning requirements, QVC and HSN may incur additional costs for closed captioning.
     Internet Services
     Our online commerce businesses are subject, both directly and indirectly, to various domestic and foreign laws and governmental regulations. Certain of these businesses engaged in the provision of goods and services over the Internet must comply with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to online communications and commerce. For example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has adopted regulations implementing COPPA. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the CAN-SPAM Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an "opt-out" mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our Internet businesses comply with the statutory requirements. Various states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications. In 2016, Congress enacted a permanent moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce.
     Our online commerce businesses also are subject to laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about their users. In particular, the collection and use of personal information by companies has received increased regulatory scrutiny on a global basis. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, in April 2016, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation which established new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information. The new data laws take effect in May 2018. Further, on October 6, 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the “Safe Harbor Framework,” which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in European Union (“EU”) nations for use in the U.S. In early 2016, European and U.S. authorities reached agreement on a new data transfer framework, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which became fully operational on August 1, 2016. Finally, on January 10, 2017, the European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as “cookies.”
     In the U.S., the FTC has proposed a privacy policy framework, and the new Congress may consider legislation that would require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to notify owners of such information. Many states have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. Complying with these different national and state privacy requirements may cause the Internet companies in which we have interests to incur substantial costs. In addition, such 

 
  I-15

 
companies generally have and post on their websites privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to comply with such posted privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal, state, or foreign privacy laws could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation) which could adversely affect our online commerce businesses. Technical violations of certain privacy laws can result in significant penalties, including statutory penalties. In 2012, the FCC amended its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA"), which could subject our Internet businesses to increased liability for certain telephonic communications with customers, including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble such damage awards for willful or knowing violations. Data collection, privacy and security are growing public concerns. If consumers were to decrease their use of our Internet businesses' websites to purchase products and services, such businesses could be harmed.  Congress, individual states and foreign authorities may consider additional online privacy legislation.
 Goods sold over the Internet also must comply with traditional regulatory requirements, such as the FTC requirements regarding truthful and accurate claims. Other Internet-related laws and regulations enacted in the future may cover issues such as defamatory speech, copyright infringement, pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services. The future adoption of such laws or regulations may slow the growth of commercial online services and the Internet, which could in turn cause a decline in the demand for the services and products of our online commerce businesses and increase their costs of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on their businesses, operating results and financial conditions. Moreover, the applicability to commercial online services and the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, personal privacy and taxation is uncertain and could expose these companies to substantial liability.
     In 2015, the FCC adopted open Internet rules that reclassify wireline and wireless broadband services as Title II common carrier services and regulate broadband services offered by Internet service providers (“ISPs”) under Title II, Title III and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  The regulations prohibit ISPs from: (1) blocking access to, or impairing or degrading, legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (2) favoring selected Internet traffic in exchange for consideration.  The rules also allow the FCC to hear complaints and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection agreements of ISPs are not just and reasonable, or if ISPs fail to meet a new general obligation not to unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage consumers or edge providers. The open Internet rules were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in June 2016, but remain subject to additional appeals.  Congress or the FCC may modify or repeal the existing regulations.
     Proposed Changes in Regulation        The regulation of programming services, cable television systems, DBS providers, Internet services, online sales and other forms of product marketing is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.
     Competition
     Our businesses that engage in video and online commerce compete with traditional brick-and-mortar and online retailers ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, such as mail order and catalog companies, and discount retailers.  Due to the nature of these businesses there is not a single or small group of competitors that own a significant portion of the overall market share.  However, some of these competitors, such as Amazon, have a significantly greater web-presence than our e-commerce subsidiaries and equity affiliates.  In addition, QVC and HSN compete for access to customers and audience share with each other and with other conventional forms of entertainment and content.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets in which our electronic commerce businesses compete are high-quality products, brand recognition, selection, value, convenience, price, website performance, customer service and accuracy of order shipment.  Our businesses that offer services through the Internet compete with businesses that offer their own services directly through the Internet as well as with traditional offline providers of similar services.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets in which our businesses that 

 
  I-16

 
offer services through the Internet engage are selection, price, availability of inventory, convenience, brand recognition, accessibility, customer service, reliability, website performance, and ease of use.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, our corporate function is supported by a services agreement with LMC which has approximately 80 corporate employees who are also considered employees of Liberty. Additionally, our consolidated subsidiaries had an aggregate of approximately 21,000 full and part-time employees.  We believe that our employee relations are good.

     Item 1A. Risk Factors    The risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization.  The risks described below are considered to be the most material.  However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses.  Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
 Risk Factors Related to our Company, the QVC Group and the Ventures Group
 The risks described below apply to our company and to the businesses and assets attributable to the QVC Group and the Ventures Group.
 The historical financial information of the QVC Group and the Ventures Group included in this Annual Report, may not necessarily reflect their results had they been separate companies. One of the reasons for the creation of a tracking stock is to permit equity investors to apply more specific criteria in valuing the shares of a particular group, such as comparisons of earnings multiples with those of other companies in the same business sector. In valuing shares of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock, investors should recognize that the historical financial information of the QVC Group and the Ventures Group has been extracted from our consolidated financial statements and may not necessarily reflect what the QVC Group’s and the Ventures Group’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had the QVC Group and the Ventures Group been separate, stand-alone entities pursuing independent strategies during the periods presented.
 Our subsidiary QVC  depends on the television distributors that carry its programming, and no assurance can be given that QVC will be able to maintain and renew its affiliation agreements on favorable terms or at all. QVC currently distributes its programming through affiliation or transmission agreements with many television providers, including, but not limited to, Comcast, AT&T/DIRECTV, DISH Network, Verizon and Cox in the U.S., Vodafone Kabel Deutschland GmbH, Media Broadcast GmbH, SES ASTRA, SES Platform Services GmbH, Telekom Deutschland GmbH, Unitymedia GmbH, Tele Columbus and Primacom in Germany, Jupiter Telecommunications, Ltd., Sky Perfect and World Hi-Vision Channel, Inc. in Japan, A1 Telekom Austria AG and UPC Telekabel Wien GmbH in Austria, British Sky Broadcasting, Freesat, Freeview and Virgin Media in the U.K. and Mediaset, Hot Bird and Sky Italia in Italy. QVC’s affiliation agreements with its distributors are scheduled to expire between 2017 and 2027.  As part of normal course renewal discussions, occasionally QVC has disagreements with its distributors over the terms of its carriage, such as channel placement or other contract terms. If not resolved through business negotiation, such disagreements could result in litigation or termination of an existing agreement. Termination of an existing agreement resulting in the loss of distribution of QVC’s programming to a material portion of its television households may adversely affect its growth, net revenue and earnings.  The renewal negotiation process for affiliation agreements is typically lengthy. In some cases, renewals are not agreed upon prior to the expiration of a given agreement while the programming continues to be carried by the relevant distributor without an effective agreement in place. QVC does not have distribution agreements with some of the cable operators that carry its programming. In total, QVC is currently providing programming without affiliation agreements to distributors representing approximately 10% of its U.S. distribution, and short-term, rolling 90 day letters of extension, to distributors who represent approximately 27% of its U.S. distribution. Some of QVC’s international programming may continue to be carried by distributors after the expiration dates on its affiliation agreements with such distributors have passed.  QVC may be unable to obtain renewals with its current distributors on acceptable terms, if at all. QVC may also be unable to successfully negotiate affiliation agreements with new or existing distributors to carry its programming. Although QVC considers its current levels of distribution without written agreement to be ordinary course, the failure to successfully renew or negotiate new affiliation agreements covering a material portion of television households could result in a discontinuation of carriage that may adversely affect its viewership, growth, net revenue and earnings.

 Our programming and online commerce businesses depend on their relationships with third party suppliers and vendors and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our results of operations and those attributed to any of our groups. An important component of the success of our programming and online commerce businesses is their ability to maintain their existing, as well as build new, relationships with a limited number of local and foreign suppliers and vendors, among other parties. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries and business affiliates will be able to maintain their existing supplier or vendor arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all or, with respect to goods sourced from foreign markets, if the supply costs will remain stable. In addition, our subsidiaries and business affiliates cannot guarantee that goods produced and delivered by third parties will meet applicable quality standards, which is impacted by a number of factors, some which are not within the control of these parties. Adverse changes in existing relationships or the inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms, if at all, could cause a failure to meet customer expectations and timely delivery of products, which could in turn have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and those attributed to our groups.
     Our businesses attributed to each group are subject to risks of adverse government regulation. Our programming businesses, such as QVC and HSN, market and provide a broad range of merchandise through television shopping programs and proprietary websites.  Similarly, our online commerce businesses, such as zulily and the e-commerce companies, market and provide a broad range of merchandise and/or services through their proprietary websites. As a result, these businesses are subject to a wide variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to change at any time, including laws regarding consumer protection, data privacy and security, the regulation of retailers generally, the license requirements for television retailers in foreign jurisdictions, the importation, sale and promotion of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities, as well as laws and regulations applicable to the Internet and businesses engaged in online commerce, such as those regulating the sending of unsolicited, commercial electronic mail and texts. The failure by our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a revocation of required licenses, fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, unfavorable changes in the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our businesses could decrease demand for our businesses’ products and services, increase costs and/or subject our businesses to additional liabilities. Similarly, new disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new state, federal or foreign laws, such as regulatory rules regarding requirements to disclose efforts to identify the origin and existence of certain “conflict minerals” or abusive labor practices in portions of QVC’s supply chain, could increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, certain of these regulations may impact the marketing efforts of our businesses and their brands.
 As mentioned above, the manner in which certain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates sell and promote merchandise and related claims and representations made in connection with these efforts is regulated by federal, state and local law, as well as the laws of the foreign countries in which they operate. Certain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates may be exposed to potential liability from claims by purchasers or from regulators and law enforcement agencies, including, but not limited to, claims for personal injury, wrongful death and damage to personal property relating to merchandise sold and misrepresentation of merchandise features and benefits. In certain instances, these subsidiaries and business affiliates have the right to seek indemnification for related liabilities from their respective vendors and may require such vendors to carry minimum levels of product liability and errors and omissions insurance. These vendors, however, may be unable to satisfy indemnification claims, obtain suitable coverage or maintain this coverage on acceptable terms, or insurance may provide inadequate coverage or be unavailable with respect to a particular claim.
 In addition, programming services, cable television systems, the Internet, telephony services and satellite service providers are subject to varying degrees of regulation in the U.S. by the FCC and other entities and in foreign countries by similar regulators. Such regulation and legislation are subject to the political process and have been in constant flux over the past decade. The application of various sales and use tax provisions under state, local and foreign law to the products and services of our subsidiaries and certain of our business affiliates sold via the Internet, television and telephone is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities, and no assurance can be given that such authorities will not take a contrary position to that taken by our subsidiaries and certain of our business affiliates, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. In addition, there have been numerous attempts at the federal, state and local levels to impose additional taxes on online commerce transactions. Moreover, most foreign countries in which our subsidiaries or 

 
  I-19

 
business affiliates have, or may in the future make, an investment, regulate, in varying degrees, the distribution, content and ownership of programming services and foreign investment in programming companies and the Internet.
 In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to consent decrees issued by the FTC barring them from making deceptive claims for specified weight-loss products and dietary supplements and prohibiting them from making certain claims about specified weight-loss, dietary supplement and anti-cellulite products unless they have competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate such claims. Violation of these consent decrees may result in the imposition of significant civil penalties for non-compliance and related redress to consumers and/or the issuance of an injunction enjoining these businesses from engaging in prohibited activities. Further material changes in the law and increased regulatory requirements must be anticipated, and there can be no assurance that the businesses and assets attributed to each group will not become subject to increased expenses or more stringent restrictions as a result of any future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.
 Weak economic conditions worldwide may reduce consumer demand for our businesses’ products and services. The prolonged economic uncertainty in various regions of the world in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate could adversely affect demand for our businesses’ products and services since a substantial portion of our businesses’ revenue is derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls during times of economic instability. Global financial markets continue to experience disruptions, including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and credit availability. If economic and financial market conditions in the U.S. or other key markets, including China, Japan and Europe, remain uncertain, persist, or deteriorate further, customers of our subsidiaries and affiliates may respond by suspending, delaying, or reducing their discretionary spending. A suspension, delay or reduction in discretionary spending could adversely affect revenue across each of our tracking stock groups. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments remain weak or decline. Such weak economic conditions may also inhibit the expansion of our subsidiaries and affiliates into new European and other markets. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.
     We may be subject to significant tax liabilities related to the CommerceHub Spin-Off or the Expedia Holdings Split-Off. In connection with the CommerceHub Spin-Off, we received an opinion of counsel to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the CommerceHub Spin-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to Liberty and to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares.  We also received an opinion of counsel in connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off to the effect that the Expedia Holdings Split-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to Liberty and to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code, except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares. In September 2016, the IRS completed its review of the CommerceHub Spin-Off and informed Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction. Liberty received an Issue Resolution Agreement from the IRS documenting this conclusion. In February 2017, the IRS completed its review of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and informed Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction. Liberty received an Issue Resolution Agreement from the IRS documenting this conclusion.
 Prior to the CommerceHub Spin-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with CommerceHub.  Under this agreement with CommerceHub, our company is generally responsible for any taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the CommerceHub Spin-Off to qualify as a tax-free transaction; however, CommerceHub is required to indemnify our company for any taxes and losses which (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by CommerceHub (applicable to actions or failures to act by CommerceHub and its subsidiaries following the completion of the CommerceHub Spin-Off), or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the CommerceHub Spin-Off as a result of the treatment of the CommerceHub Spin-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in the stock of CommerceHub or any successor corporation.  As the taxpaying entity, however, we are subject to the risk of non-payment by CommerceHub of its indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement.
 Similarly, prior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Expedia Holdings.  Under this agreement with Expedia Holdings, our company is generally responsible for any taxes and losses resulting from 

 
  I-20

 
the failure of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off to qualify as a tax-free transaction; however, Expedia Holdings is required to indemnify our company for any taxes and losses which (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by Expedia Holdings (applicable to actions or failures to act by Expedia Holdings and its subsidiaries following the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off), or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off as a result of the treatment of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in the stock of Expedia Holdings or any successor corporation.  As the taxpaying entity, however, we are subject to the risk of non-payment by Expedia Holdings of its indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement.
 To preserve the tax-free treatment of the CommerceHub Spin-Off and the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, we may determine to forego certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to our company, including certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following each of the CommerceHub Spin-Off and the Expedia Holdings Split-Off.  In addition, our potential tax liabilities related to the CommerceHub Spin-Off and the Expedia Holdings Split-Off might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following each of the CommerceHub Spin-Off and the Expedia Holdings Split-Off.
 Rapid technological advances could render the products and services offered by our subsidiaries and our business affiliates attributed to our QVC Group and our Ventures Group obsolete or non-competitive. Our subsidiaries and business affiliates attributed to each group must stay abreast of rapidly evolving technological developments and offerings to remain competitive and increase the utility of their services. As their operations grow in size and scope, our subsidiaries and business affiliates must continuously improve and upgrade their systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of their systems and infrastructure. These subsidiaries and business affiliates must be able to incorporate new technologies into their products and services in order to address the needs of their customers. The emergence of alternative platforms such as mobile and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. New developments in other areas, such as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter their markets due to lower up-front technology costs. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries and business affiliates will be able to compete with advancing technology or be able to maintain existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as they would like or in a cost-effective manner, and any failure to do so could result in customers seeking alternative service providers and may adversely affect the group to which they are attributed, thereby adversely impacting our revenue and operating income.
     Our subsidiaries and business affiliates attributed to each of our QVC and Ventures Groups conduct their businesses under highly competitive conditions. Although QVC and HSN are two of the nation’s largest home shopping networks, they and their e-commerce businesses have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, wholesale clubs, discount retailers, infomercial retailers, Internet retailers, and mail-order and catalog companies.  In addition, QVC competes with HSN as well as other televised shopping retailers, such as EVINE Live in the U.S., Shop Channel in Japan, HSE 24 in Germany and Italy, Ideal World in the U.K., and M6 Boutique in France, infomercial retailers, Internet retailers, and mail-order and catalog companies.  QVC also competes for access to customers and audience share with other providers of televised, online and hard copy entertainment and content. Similarly, zulily competes with e-commerce businesses such as Amazon.com, Inc. and Alibaba Group, the e-commerce platforms of traditional retailers such as Target Corporation, Toys”R”Us, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and online marketplaces such as eBay Inc. zulily expects increased competition with companies employing a flash sales model as there are no significant barriers to entry. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, accessibility, site functionality, reputation and credit availability, as well as the financial, technical and marketing expertise of competitors. For example, many of our businesses’ competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers and greater brand recognition than our businesses do, and competitors may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, offer free or subsidized shipping and devote more resources to technology, fulfillment and marketing. In addition, many retailers, especially online retailers with whom our subsidiaries and business affiliates compete, are increasingly offering customers aggressive shipping terms, including free or discounted expedited shipping.  As these practices become more prevalent, our subsidiaries and business affiliates may experience further competitive pressures to attract customers and/or to change their shipping programs. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that 

 
  I-21

 
strengthen their competitive positions. If our subsidiaries and business affiliates do not compete effectively with regard to these factors, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
     The sales and operating results of the businesses attributed to each of our QVC Group and Ventures Group depend on their ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and predict or respond to consumer preferences. In an effort to attract and retain customers, these businesses engage in various merchandising and marketing initiatives, which involve the expenditure of money and resources. These initiatives, however, may not resonate with existing customers or consumers generally or may not be cost-effective. In addition, costs associated with the production and distribution of television programming (in the case of QVC and HSN) and costs associated with online marketing, including search engine marketing (primarily the purchase of relevant keywords) have increased and are likely to continue to increase in the foreseeable future and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect to the extent that they do not result in corresponding increases in net revenue. These companies also continuously develop new retail concepts and adjust their product mix in an effort to satisfy customer demands. Any sustained failure to identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of these subsidiaries and business affiliates. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of their control, including competition from store-based retailers, mail-order and third-party Internet companies, consumer confidence and preferences, and general economic conditions.
     The failure of our subsidiary QVC and our business affiliate HSN to maintain suitable placement for their respective programming could adversely affect their ability to attract and retain television viewers and could result in a decrease in revenue. QVC and HSN are dependent upon the continued ability of their programming to compete for viewers.  Effectively competing for television viewers is dependent, in substantial part, on their ability to negotiate and maintain placement of their programming at a favorable channel position, such as in a basic tier or within a general entertainment or general broadcasting tier. The advent of digital compression technologies and the adoption of digital cable have resulted in increased channel capacity, which together with other changing laws, rules and regulations regarding cable television ownership, impacts the ability of both QVC and HSN to negotiate and maintain suitable channel placement with their respective distributors. Increased channel capacity could adversely affect the ability to attract television viewers to QVC’s or HSN’s programming to the extent it results in a less favorable channel position for their respective programming, such as placement adjacent to programming that does not complement their respective programming, a position next to their respective televised home shopping competitors or isolation in a "shopping" tier, more competitors entering the marketplace, or more programming options being available to the viewing public in the form of new television networks and timeshifted viewing (e.g., personal video recorders, video-on-demand, interactive television and streaming video over Internet connections). In addition, if QVC’s or HSN’s programming is carried exclusively by a distributor on a digital programming tier, QVC or HSN may experience a reduction in revenue to the extent that the digital programming tier has less television viewer penetration than the basic or expanded basic programming tier. QVC and HSN may experience a further reduction in revenue due to increased television viewing audience fragmentation to the extent that not all television sets within a digital cable home are equipped to receive television programming in a digital format. The future success of each of QVC and HSN will depend, in part, on their ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer elements of their respective programming via new technologies in a cost-effective manner that meets customer demands and evolving industry standards.
     Any continued or permanent inability of QVC or HSN to transmit their programming via satellite would result in lost revenue and could result in lost customers. The success of our subsidiary QVC and our business affiliate HSN is dependent upon their continued ability to transmit their respective programming to television providers from their respective satellite uplink facilities, which transmissions are subject to FCC compliance in the U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements in QVC’s and HSN’s  international operations. In most cases, each of QVC and HSN has entered into long-term satellite transponder leases to provide for continued carriage of its programming on replacement transponders and/or replacement satellites, as applicable, in the event of a failure of either the transponders and/or satellites currently carrying its programming.  Although QVC believes that it takes reasonable and customary measures to ensure continued satellite transmission capability and believes that these international transponder service agreements can be renewed (or replaced, if necessary) in the ordinary course of business, termination or interruption of satellite transmissions may occur, particularly if QVC is not able to successfully negotiate renewals or replacements of any of its expiring transponder service agreements in the future.

 System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the systems and infrastructures of our subsidiary QVC, our business affiliate HSN and our other online commerce businesses may adversely affect their ability to, as applicable, operate their businesses, transmit their television programs, operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. The success of our subsidiaries and business affiliates depends, in part, on their ability to maintain the integrity of their transmissions, systems and infrastructures, including the transmission of television programs (in the case of QVC and HSN), as well as their websites, information and related systems, call centers and fulfillment facilities. These subsidiaries and business affiliates may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all transmissions, systems or data unavailable or prevent them from transmitting their signals or efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders, as the case may be. QVC is in the process of implementing new technology systems and upgrading others. The failure to properly implement new systems or delays in implementing new systems could impair the ability of our subsidiaries and business affiliates to provide services and content, fulfill orders and/or process transactions. QVC and HSN also rely on affiliate and third-party computer systems, broadband, transmission and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the transmission of their respective signals, as well as to facilitate, process and fulfill transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in their signal transmissions, systems and infrastructures, or any deterioration in the performance of these transmissions, systems and infrastructures, could impair their ability to provide services, fulfill orders and/or process transactions. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt television transmissions, computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time. Any of these events could cause transmission or system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent our subsidiaries and business affiliates from providing services, fulfilling orders and/or processing transactions. While our subsidiaries and business affiliates have backup systems for certain aspects of their operations, these systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all possible risks. In addition, some of our subsidiaries and business affiliates may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.
     The processing, storage, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights. In the processing of consumer transactions and managing their employees, our businesses receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. The processing, storage, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the privacy and data security policies maintained by these businesses. Moreover, there are federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the processing, storage, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations, including changes in legislation and regulations, in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. Compliance with these laws and regulations, or changes in these laws and regulations, may be onerous and expensive and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance.  For example, the European Court of Justice in October 2015 issued a ruling immediately invalidating the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, which facilitated personal data transfers to the U.S. in compliance with applicable European data protection laws. Following this invalidation, the U.S. and European Union ("EU") authorities approved a new data transfer structure, the Privacy Shield, to replace the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, but the Privacy Shield is now the subject of litigation similar to the litigation that resulted in the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework. In addition, Standard Contractual Clauses - another key mechanism to allow data transfers between the U.S. and the EU - are also subject to litigation over whether Standard Contractual Clauses can be used for transferring personal data from the EU to the U.S. Further, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have approved a General Data Protection Regulation, which enters into application on May 25, 2018 and which will give consumers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information. Finally, on January 10, 2017, the European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as “cookies.”  QVC’s failure, and/or the failure by the various third party vendors and service providers with which QVC does business, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations, or changes in applicable laws and regulations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage QVC’s reputation and the reputation of its third party vendors and service providers, discourage potential users from trying its products and services and/or result in fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or consumers, any one or all of which could adversely affect 

 
  I-23

 
QVC’s business, financial condition and results of operations of these businesses and, as a result, our company. In addition, we, our subsidiaries or our business affiliates may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses.
 Our home television and online commerce businesses are subject to security risks, including security breaches and identity theft. In order to succeed, our home television and online commerce businesses must be able to provide for secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could cause interruptions in the operations of their business and subject them to increased costs, litigation and other liabilities. Security breaches could also significantly damage their reputation with their customers and third parties with whom they do business. These businesses may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences. They also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which they are affiliated or otherwise conduct business online. The loss of confidence in our online commerce businesses resulting from any such security breaches or identity theft could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our online commerce businesses and, as a result, our company.
     Certain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates may fail to adequately protect their intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. Our subsidiaries and business affiliates regard their respective intellectual property rights, including service marks, trademarks and domain names, copyrights (including their programming and their websites), trade secrets and similar intellectual property, as critical to their success. These businesses also rely heavily upon software codes, informational databases and other components that make up their products and services. From time to time, these businesses are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce the intellectual property rights of these businesses, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of these businesses and in turn our financial condition and results of operations. The failure of these businesses to protect their intellectual property rights, particularly their proprietary brands, in a meaningful manner or third party challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit the ability of these businesses to control marketing on or through the Internet using their various domain names, which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of these businesses, as well as the financial condition and results of operations of our company.
     Our home television and online commerce businesses rely on independent shipping companies to deliver the products they sell. Our home television and online commerce businesses rely on third party carriers to deliver merchandise from vendors and manufacturers to them and to ship merchandise to their customers. As a result, they are subject to carrier disruptions and delays due to factors that are beyond their control, including employee strikes, inclement weather and regulation and enforcement actions by customs agencies.  Any failure to deliver products to their customers in a timely and accurate manner may damage their reputation and brand and could cause them to lose customers. Enforcement actions by customs agencies can also cause the costs of imported goods to increase, negatively affecting profits.  These businesses are also impacted by increases in shipping rates charged by third party carriers, which over the past few years have increased significantly in comparison to historical levels, and it is currently expected that shipping and postal rates will continue to increase.  In the case of deliveries to customers, in each market where they operate, they have negotiated agreements with one or more independent, third party shipping companies, which in certain circumstances provide for favorable shipping rates.  If any of these relationships were to terminate or if a shipping company was unable to fulfill its obligations under its contract for any reason, these businesses would have to work with other shipping companies to deliver merchandise to customers, which would most likely be at less favorable rates.  Other potential adverse consequences of changing carriers include reduced visibility of order status and package tracking, delays in order processing and product delivery, and reduced shipment quality, which may result in damaged products and customer dissatisfaction. Any increase in shipping rates and related fuel and other surcharges passed on to these businesses by their current carriers or any other shipping company would adversely impact profits, given that these businesses may not be able to pass these increased costs directly to customers or offset them by increasing prices without a detrimental effect on customer demand.
     zulily generally does not hold inventory until products have been ordered by customers, which results in slower delivery time than other e-commerce retailers.    zulily generally does not order inventory from its vendors to be held in 

 
  I-24

 
its fulfillment centers until after the products have been ordered by its customers. As a result, the time from when an order is placed on zulily’s sites to when the product is delivered to its customers is longer than for many other e-commerce retailers who generally carry significant inventory that enables them to expedite delivery. In an effort to reduce delivery times without carrying additional inventory, zulily has expanded consignment and fulfillment services for its vendors. zulily may not achieve its anticipated improvement in delivery times if it is unable to effectively deploy these services or engage a sufficient number of vendors to adopt these services. Modification of zulily’s inventory planning and consolidation processes may also result in inconsistent or slower delivery times. Utilization of zulily’s infrastructure for vendor fulfillment services could also negatively impact delivery times. zulily’s relatively slower delivery times may place it at a competitive disadvantage to other e-commerce retailers and may cause customers to stop purchasing from zulily. If it is required to decrease its delivery times to address this competition or to meet customer demands, zulily may be required to incur additional shipping costs, which it may or may not be able to pass on to its customers, or to change its operations to carry additional inventory and face additional inventory risk, either of which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of zulily and, as a result, our company.
     The seasonality of certain of our businesses places increased strain on their operations. The net revenue of our home television and online commerce businesses in recent years indicates that these businesses are seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in certain months or calendar quarters or related to particular holiday shopping. For example, in recent years, QVC has earned, on average, between 22% and 24% of its global revenue in each of the first three quarters of the year and between 30% and 32% of its global revenue in the fourth quarter of the year. Similarly, our subsidiary zulily experiences a stronger third quarter during the back-to-school shopping season and stronger fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season. If the vendors for these businesses are not able to provide popular products in sufficient amounts such that these businesses fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect their revenue and future growth. If too many customers access the websites of these businesses within a short period of time due to increased demand, our businesses may experience system interruptions that make their websites unavailable or prevent them from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods they sell and the attractiveness of their products and services. In addition, they may be unable to adequately staff their fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other third party shipping (or carrier) companies may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. To the extent these businesses pay for holiday merchandise in advance of certain holidays (e.g., in the case of QVC, in August through November of each year), their available cash may decrease, resulting in less liquidity.
     The failure of our subsidiary QVC to effectively manage its Easy-Pay and revolving credit card programs could result in less income. QVC offers Easy-Pay in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Italy (known as Q-Pay in Germany and Italy), a payment plan that, when offered by QVC, allows customers to pay for certain merchandise in two or more monthly installments. When Easy-Pay is offered by QVC and elected by the customer, the first installment is typically billed to the customer’s credit card upon shipment. Generally, the customer’s credit card is subsequently billed up to five additional monthly installments until the total purchase price of the products has been billed by QVC. QVC cannot predict whether customers will pay all of their Easy-Pay installments. In addition, QVC-U.S. has an agreement with a large consumer financial institution (the “Bank”) pursuant to which the Bank provides revolving credit directly to QVC’s customers for the sole purpose of purchasing merchandise from QVC with a QVC branded credit card (“Q Card”). QVC receives a portion of the net economics of the credit card program according to percentages that vary with the performance of the portfolio. We cannot predict the extent to which QVC’s customers will use the Q Card, nor the extent that they will make payments on their outstanding balances.
     The success of our home television and online commerce businesses depends in large part on their ability to recruit and retain key personnel capable of executing their unique business models.  QVC and HSN, as well as our e-commerce subsidiaries and business affiliates have business models that require them to recruit and retain key employees, including management, with the skills necessary for a unique business that demands knowledge of the general retail industry, television production, direct to consumer marketing and fulfillment and the Internet.  We cannot assure you that if QVC, HSN or our online commerce businesses experience turnover of these key employees they will be able to recruit and retain acceptable replacements because the market for such employees is very competitive and limited.

      Moreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in certain developing economies, it is not uncommon to encounter business practices that are prohibited by certain regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. Although certain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates have undertaken compliance efforts with respect to these laws, their respective employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which they outsource certain of their business operations, may take actions in violation of their policies and procedures. Any such violation, even if prohibited by the policies and procedures of these subsidiaries and business affiliates or the law, could have certain adverse effects on the financial condition of these subsidiaries and business affiliates. Any failure by these subsidiaries and business affiliates to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international operation of their businesses could materially adversely affect their, and hence our, financial condition.
     Significant developments stemming from the 2016 U.S. presidential election or the Brexit vote could have a material adverse effect on businesses attributed to the QVC and Ventures Groups. After the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2017, President Donald J. Trump and his administration took office in the United States. As a presidential candidate, President Trump expressed apprehension towards existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and suggested that the U.S. would renegotiate or withdraw from these agreements. During the campaign, he also raised the possibility of significantly increasing tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China and Mexico, which if implemented, could adversely affect businesses attributed to the QVC and Ventures Groups that sell imported products. Other changes supported by the Trump administration include significant U.S. tax reform of long-standing tax principles in the U.S. which could also adversely affect our operating results and our business.
 Additionally, the results from the recent Brexit vote have created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the U.K. and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. QVC’s business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of this vote. In addition, QVC’s business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the U.K. and other countries, including the U.S., and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the U.K. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the U.K.’s actual withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect QVC’s operating results.
     Our online commerce businesses, including QVC, zulily and HSN could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or search engine disintermediation as well as their inability to monetize the resulting web traffic. The success of our online commerce businesses depends on a high degree of website traffic, which is dependent on many factors, including the availability of appealing website content, user loyalty and new user generation from search portals that charge a fee (such as Google).  In obtaining a significant amount of website traffic via search engines, they utilize techniques such as search engine optimization (“SEO”) which is the practice of developing websites 

 
  I-26

 
with relevant and current content that rank well in “organic,” or unpaid, search engine results) and search engine marketing (“SEM”) (which is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages through the use of paid placement, contextual advertising, and paid inclusion) to improve their placement in relevant search queries. Search engines, including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to the websites of our online commerce businesses can be negatively affected. Moreover, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing their websites to place lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects their paid or unpaid search ranking, or if competitive dynamics impact the effectiveness of SEO or SEM in a negative manner, the business and financial performance of our online commerce businesses would be adversely affected, potentially to a material extent. Furthermore, the failure of our online commerce businesses to successfully manage their SEO and SEM strategies could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to their websites, as well as increased costs if they were to replace free traffic with paid traffic.  Even if our online commerce businesses are successful in generating a high level of website traffic, no assurance can be given that our online commerce businesses will be successful in achieving repeat user loyalty or that new visitors will explore the offerings on their sites. Monetizing this traffic by converting users to consumers is dependent on many factors, including availability of inventory, consumer preferences, price, ease of use and website quality.  No assurance can be given that the fees paid to search portals will not exceed the revenue generated by their visitors.  Any failure to sustain user traffic or to monetize such traffic could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our online commerce businesses and, as a result, adversely affect our financial results.
     Our online commerce businesses, including QVC, zulily and HSN, may experience difficulty in achieving the successful development, implementation and customer acceptance of, and a viable advertising market via, applications for smartphone and tablet computing devices, which could harm their business. Although our online commerce businesses have developed services and applications to address user and consumer interaction with website content on smartphone and other non-traditional desktop or laptop computer systems (which typically have smaller screens and less convenient typing capabilities), the efficacy of the smartphone application and its advertising market is still developing. Moreover, if smartphone computing services prove to be less effective for the users of our online commerce businesses or less economically attractive for advertisers and the smartphone segment of Internet traffic grows at the expense of traditional computer and tablet Internet access, our online commerce businesses may experience difficulty attracting and retaining traffic and, in turn, advertisers, on these platforms. Additionally, as new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the challenges that may be encountered in developing versions of our online commerce businesses’ offerings for use on these alternative devices, and our online commerce businesses may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of their services on such devices. To the extent that revenue generated from advertising placed on smartphone computing devices becomes increasingly more important to their businesses and they fail to adequately evolve and address this market, their business and financial performance could be negatively impacted. In addition, growth in the use of smartphone products as a substitute for use on personal computers and tablets may adversely impact revenue derived from advertising, as many of the processes used for smartphone advertising and related monetization strategies are still in development.
     Our subsidiary QVC has significant indebtedness, which could limit its flexibility to respond to current market conditions, restrict its business activities and adversely affect its financial condition.   As of December 31, 2016, QVC had total debt of approximately $5,320 million, consisting of $3,550 million in senior secured notes, $1,596 million under its senior secured credit facility and $174 million of capital and build to suit lease obligations. QVC also had $744 million available for borrowing under its senior secured credit facility as of that date. QVC may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. The indebtedness of QVC, combined with other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could among other things:

· | increase QVC’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require a substantial portion of QVC’s cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limit QVC’s ability to use cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, which reduces the funds available to it for operations and any future business opportunities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limit flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the markets in which it operates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | competitively disadvantage QVC compared with competitors that have less debt;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  I-27

 


· | limit QVC’s ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that it finds acceptable; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expose QVC to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of QVC’s borrowings, including borrowings under its credit facility, are at variable interest rates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, it is possible that QVC may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. If new debt is added to its current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. If QVC experiences adverse effects on its financial condition as a result of its indebtedness, our financial performance could be adversely affected as well.
     We may fail to realize the potential benefits of the acquisition of zulily or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We believe there are significant benefits and synergies that may be realized through leveraging the scale, vendor relationships, merchandizing expertise and customer base of QVC and zulily. However, the efforts to realize these benefits and synergies will be a complex process and may disrupt both companies’ existing operations if not implemented in a timely and efficient manner. If the respective managements of Liberty, QVC and zulily are unable to minimize the potential disruption to their respective businesses and operations during this period, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of zulily. Realizing these benefits may depend in part on the efficient coordination and alignment of various functions, including marketing, merchandising, buying expertise, customer acquisition and the integration of certain administrative functions, while maintaining adequate focus on QVC’s and zulily’s core businesses. 
     The operating expenses attributed to the QVC Group are expected to increase over the near term due to the increased headcount, expanded operations and changes related to the assimilation of zulily. In addition, we have incurred expenses related to the acquisition of zulily that have been attributed to the QVC Group, which may adversely affect our financial results. To the extent that our expenses increase but revenue does not increase commensurately, there are unanticipated expenses related to the assimilation process, there are significant costs associated with presently unknown liabilities, or if the foregoing charges and expenses are larger than anticipated, our consolidated business, operating results and financial condition, as well as those attributable to the QVC Group, may be adversely affected. Failure to timely implement, or problems with implementing, the post-acquisition strategy for zulily also may adversely affect the trading price of QVC Group common stock. 
     We depend on the continued growth of e-commerce in general and zulily depends on the flash sales model in particular. The business of selling products over the Internet, particularly on the flash sales model, is dynamic and evolving. The market segment for the flash sales model has grown significantly, and this growth may not be sustainable. If customers cease to find the flash sales model shopping experience fun, entertaining and a good value, or otherwise lose interest in shopping in this manner, zulily may not acquire new customers at rates consistent with its historical or projected periods, and existing customers’ buying patterns and levels may be less than historical or projected rates. If zulily is unable to successfully deliver emails or mobile alerts to its subscribers, or if subscribers decline to open its emails or mobile alerts, zulily’s net sales and profitability would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in how webmail application providers, such as Google Inc. and Yahoo! Inc., prioritize, filter and deliver email may also reduce the number of subscribers opening zulily’s emails which may also result in a decline in net sales. If the market segment for the flash sales model were to become saturated or decline overall, zulily may not be able to acquire new customers or engage existing customers, which could adversely affect the QVC Group’s financial condition and operating results.
     We do not have the right to manage our business affiliates attributed to either our QVC Group or our Ventures Group, which means we are not able to cause those affiliates to act in a manner that we deem desirable.  We do not have the right to manage the businesses or affairs of any of our business affiliates (generally those companies in which we have less than a majority voting stake or with respect to which we have provided a proxy over our voting power to a third party) including HSN, which is attributed to our QVC Group. Rather, our rights may take the form of representation on the board of directors or similar committee that supervises management or possession of veto rights over significant or extraordinary actions. The scope of our veto rights varies from agreement to agreement. Although our board representation and veto rights may enable us to exercise influence over the management or policies of a business affiliate, enable us to prevent the sale of material assets by a business affiliate in which we own less than a majority voting interest or prevent us from paying dividends or making distributions to our stockholders or partners, they will not enable us to cause these actions to be taken as these companies are business affiliates in which we own a partial interest.

 We have overlapping directors and management with LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband and Expedia Holdings, which may lead to conflicting interests. As a result of the LMC Split-Off, the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off, LMC's spin-off of Liberty Broadband in November 2014 and the Expedia Holdings Split-Off in November 2016, most of the executive officers of Liberty also serve as executive officers of LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband and Expedia Holdings, and there are overlapping directors. Other than Liberty’s ownership of shares of Liberty Broadband’s non-voting Series C common stock, none of the foregoing companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and the members of our company’s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband or Expedia Holdings have fiduciary duties to that company’s stockholders. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband or Expedia Holdings looks at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Moreover, most of our company's directors and officers own LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband and Expedia Holdings stock and equity awards. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company, LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband and/or Expedia Holdings. Any potential conflict that qualifies as a "related party transaction" (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer's board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Each of Liberty Broadband, TripAdvisor Holdings and Expedia Holdings has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and each company’s restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions deeming directors and officers not in breach of their fiduciary duties in certain cases for directing a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband and Expedia Holdings) instead of such company. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband or Expedia Holdings and/or their subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, LMC, TripAdvisor Holdings, Liberty Broadband, Expedia Holdings or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.
 The liquidity and value of our public investments may be affected by market conditions beyond our control that could cause us to record losses for declines in their market value. Included among our assets are equity interests in publicly-traded companies that are not consolidated subsidiaries. The value of these interests may be affected by economic and market conditions that are beyond our control; and our ability to liquidate or otherwise monetize these interests without adversely affecting their value may be limited. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we owned (and attributed to our Ventures Group) shares of Charter valued at approximately $1.5 billion and shares of Liberty Broadband, which is Charter's largest stockholder with a 25.01% voting interest in Charter, valued at approximately $3.2 billion. The risks associated with the business of Charter, and hence the business of Liberty Broadband, are different than those associated with the video and online commerce industries in which our subsidiaries and equity affiliates operate. For additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties, we refer the holders of Liberty Ventures common stock to “Item 1A, Risk Factors, Factors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure” and “Item 1A, Risk Factors, Factors Relating to Charter” of Liberty Broadband Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2017.
 A substantial portion of our consolidated debt attributed to each group is held above the operating subsidiary level, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service that debt and our other financial obligations. As of December 31, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary Liberty Interactive LLC (“Liberty LLC”) had $2,751 million principal amount of publicly-traded debt outstanding. Liberty LLC is a holding company for all of our subsidiaries and investments. Our ability to meet the financial obligations of Liberty LLC and our other financial obligations will depend on our ability to access cash. Our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from operating activities, dividends and interest from our investments, availability under credit facilities at the operating subsidiary level, monetization of our public investment portfolio and proceeds from asset sales. There are no assurances that we will maintain the amounts of cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities that we maintained over the past few years. The ability of our operating subsidiaries, including QVC, to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us or 

 
  I-29

 
Liberty LLC depends on their individual operating results, any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and the terms of their own indebtedness, including QVC’s credit facility and bond indentures. The agreements governing such indebtedness restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to stockholders and partners. Neither we nor Liberty LLC will generally receive cash, in the form of dividends, loans, advances or otherwise, from our business affiliates. See “-We do not have the right to manage our business affiliates attributed to either our QVC Group or our Ventures Group, which means we are not able to cause those affiliates to act in a manner that we deem desirable” above.
 We have disposed of certain of the reference shares underlying the exchangeable debentures of Liberty LLC attributed to our Ventures Group, which exposes us to liquidity risk. Liberty LLC currently has outstanding multiple tranches of exchangeable debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $1,960 million as of December 31, 2016. Under the terms of these exchangeable debentures, which are attributed to our Ventures Group (other than the 1% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2043, which are attributed to the QVC Group), the holders may elect to require Liberty LLC to exchange the debentures for the value of a specified number of the underlying reference shares, which Liberty LLC may honor through delivery of reference shares, cash or a combination thereof. Also, Liberty LLC is required to distribute to the holders of its exchangeable debentures any cash, securities (other than publicly traded securities, which would themselves become reference shares) or other payments made by the issuer of the reference shares in respect of those shares. The principal amount of the debentures will be reduced by the amount of any such required distributions other than regular cash dividends. As Liberty LLC has disposed of some of the reference shares underlying certain of these exchangeable debentures, any exercise of the exchange right by, or required distribution of cash, securities or other payments to, holders of such debentures will require that Liberty LLC fund the required payments from its own resources, which will depend on the availability of cash or other sources of liquidity to Liberty LLC at that time. Additionally, in the event all reference shares underlying a series of exchangeable debentures are liquidated or otherwise cease to be outstanding without replacement, there is a possibility that the treatment of tax matters associated with that series could change. This may include acceleration of tax liabilities that are recorded as deferred tax liabilities in our financial statements, in amounts that would be significant.
 Risks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock due to our Tracking Stock Capitalization
 Holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock are common stockholders of our company and are, therefore, subject to risks associated with an investment in our company as a whole, even if a holder does not own shares of common stock of both of our groups. Even though we have attributed, for financial reporting purposes, all of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows to either the QVC Group or the Ventures Group in order to prepare the separate financial statement schedules for each of those groups, we retain legal title to all of our assets and our capitalization does not limit our legal responsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in any set of financial statement schedules. Holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock do not have any legal rights related to specific assets attributed to the QVC Group or the Ventures Group and, in any liquidation, holders of QVC Group tracking stock and holders of Ventures Group tracking stock will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of our available net assets based on their respective numbers of liquidation units.
 Our board of directors' ability to reattribute businesses, assets and expenses between tracking stock groups may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of either tracking stock group based on its past performance. Our board of directors is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to one tracking stock group to the other tracking stock group, without the approval of any of our stockholders. For example, in October 2014, our board of directors approved the change in attribution from the QVC Group to the Ventures Group of certain Liberty online commerce subsidiaries and approximately $1 billion in cash, without stockholder approval. Any reattribution made by our board of directors, as well as the existence of the right in and of itself to effect a reattribution, may impact the ability of investors to assess the future prospects of either tracking stock group, including its liquidity and capital resource needs, based on its past performance. Stockholders may also have difficulty evaluating the liquidity and capital resources of each group based on past performance, as our board of directors may use one group's liquidity to fund the other group's liquidity and capital expenditure requirements through the use of inter-group loans and inter-group interests.
     We could be required to use assets attributed to one group to pay liabilities attributed to the other group. The assets attributed to one group are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to the other group, even if those liabilities 

 
  I-30

 
arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are attributed to such other group. While our current management and allocation policies provide that reattributions of assets between groups will result in the creation of an inter-group loan or an inter-group interest or an offsetting reattribution of cash or other assets, no provision of our restated charter prevents us from satisfying liabilities of one group with assets of the other group, and our creditors are not in any way limited by our tracking stock capitalization from proceeding against any assets they could have proceeded against if we did not have a tracking stock capitalization.
     The market price of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock may not reflect the performance of the QVC Group and the Ventures Group, respectively, as we intend.  We cannot assure you that the market price of the common stock of a group, in fact, will reflect the performance of the group of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to that group. Holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock are common stockholders of our company as a whole and, as such, will be subject to all risks associated with an investment in our company and all of our businesses, assets and liabilities. As a result, the market price of each series of stock of a group may simply reflect the performance of our company as a whole or may more independently reflect the performance of some or all of the group of assets attributed to such group. In addition, investors may discount the value of the stock of a group because it is part of a common enterprise rather than a stand-alone entity.
 The market price of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock may be volatile, could fluctuate substantially and could be affected by factors that do not affect traditional common stock. The market prices of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock may be materially affected by, among other things:

· | actual or anticipated fluctuations in a group's operating results or in the operating results of particular companies attributable to such group;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential acquisition activity by our company, our subsidiaries or our business affiliates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | issuances of debt or equity securities to raise capital by our company, our subsidiaries or our business affiliates and the manner in which that debt or the proceeds of an equity issuance are attributed to each of the groups;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock or the companies attributable to either of our tracking stock groups;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of both of our tracking stocks, as well as concerns regarding the possible effect of certain of those terms on an investment in our stock; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | general market conditions.
--+---------------------------

      The market value of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock could be adversely affected by events involving the assets and businesses attributed to either of the groups.  Because we are the issuer of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock, an adverse market reaction to events relating to the assets and businesses attributed to either of our groups, such as earnings announcements, announcements of new products or services, or acquisitions or dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may cause an adverse reaction to the common stock of our other group. This could occur even if the triggering event is not material to us as a whole. A certain triggering event may also have a greater impact on one group than the same triggering event would have on the other group due to the asset composition of the affected group. In addition, the incurrence of significant indebtedness by us or any of our subsidiaries on behalf of one group, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with acquisitions of or investments in businesses, could affect our credit rating and that of our subsidiaries and, therefore, could increase the borrowing costs of businesses attributable to our other group or the borrowing costs of our company as a whole.
 We may not pay dividends equally or at all on QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock. We do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock for the foreseeable future. However, we will have the right to pay dividends on the shares of common stock of each group in equal or unequal amounts, and we may pay dividends on the shares of common stock of one group and not pay dividends on shares of common stock of the other group. In addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to either group will reduce our assets legally available to be paid as dividends on the shares relating to the other group.
 Our tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our board of directors may make decisions that could adversely affect only some holders of our common stock. Our tracking stock capital structure could 

 
  I-31

 
give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of stock of one group might diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of stock of the other group. In addition, given the nature of their businesses, there may be inherent conflicts of interests between the QVC Group and the Ventures Group. Our tracking stock groups are not separate entities and thus holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock do not have the right to elect separate boards of directors. As a result, our company's officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to our company as a whole and all of our stockholders as opposed to only holders of a particular group. Decisions deemed to be in the best interest of our company and all of our stockholders may not be in the best interest of a particular group when considered independently. Examples include:

· | decisions as to the terms of any business relationships that may be created between the QVC Group and the Ventures Group or the terms of any reattributions of assets or liabilities between the groups;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | decisions as to the allocation of consideration among the holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock, or among the series of stocks relating to either of our groups, to be received in connection with a merger involving our company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | decisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the groups, especially where the opportunities might meet the strategic business objectives of both groups;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | decisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one group but beneficial to the other;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | decisions as to the conversion of shares of common stock of one group into shares of common stock of the other;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | decisions regarding the creation of, and, if created, the subsequent increase or decrease of any inter-group interest that one group may own in the other group;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | decisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to either of our groups;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | decisions as to the dispositions of assets of either of our groups; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | decisions as to the payment of dividends on the stock relating to either of our groups.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our directors' or officers' ownership of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock may create or appear to create conflicts of interest. If directors or officers own disproportionate interests (in percentage or value terms) in QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock, that disparity could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when they are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the holders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock.
     Other than pursuant to our management and allocation policies, we have not adopted any specific procedures for consideration of matters involving a divergence of interests among holders of shares of stock relating to our two groups, or among holders of different series of stock relating to a specific group. Rather than develop additional specific procedures in advance, our board of directors intends to exercise its judgment from time to time, depending on the circumstances, as to how best to:

· | obtain information regarding the divergence (or potential divergence) of interests;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | determine under what circumstances to seek the assistance of outside advisers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | determine whether a committee of our board of directors should be appointed to address a specific matter and the appropriate members of that committee; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assess what is in our best interests and the best interests of all of our stockholders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our board of directors believes the advantage of retaining flexibility in determining how to fulfill its responsibilities in any such circumstances as they may arise outweighs any perceived advantages of adopting additional specific procedures in advance.
 Our board of directors may change the management and allocation policies to the detriment of either group without stockholder approval.  Our board of directors has adopted certain management and allocation policies to serve as guidelines in making decisions regarding the relationships between the QVC Group and the Ventures Group with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits, inter-group loans, inter-group interests, attribution of assets, financing 

 
  I-32

 
alternatives, corporate opportunities and similar items. These policies also set forth the initial focuses and strategies of these groups and the initial attribution of our businesses, assets and liabilities between them. These policies are not included in the restated certificate of incorporation (the “restated charter”). Our board of directors may at any time change or make exceptions to these policies. Because these policies relate to matters concerning the day-to-day management of our company as opposed to significant corporate actions, such as a merger involving our company or a sale of substantially all of our assets, no stockholder approval is required with respect to their adoption or amendment. A decision to change, or make exceptions to, these policies or adopt additional policies could disadvantage one group while advantaging the other.
 Holders of shares of stock relating to a particular group may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that stock, or on a particular series of that stock. Principles of Delaware law and the provisions of our restated charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of shares of stock relating to a particular group, or upon holders of any series of stock relating to a particular group. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, regardless of the stock, or series, they hold. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all stockholders and does not have separate or additional duties to any subset of stockholders. Judicial opinions in Delaware involving tracking stocks have established that decisions by directors or officers involving differing treatment of holders of tracking stocks may be judged under the “business judgment rule.” In some circumstances, our directors or officers may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of shares relating to a particular group or to the holders of a particular series of that stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule referred to above, a stockholder may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that a stockholder believes have a disparate impact upon the stockholders of one of our groups if a majority of our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of Liberty and all of our stockholders.
 Stockholders will not vote on how to attribute consideration received in connection with a merger involving our company among holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock. Our restated charter does not contain any provisions governing how consideration received in connection with a merger or consolidation involving our company is to be attributed to the holders of QVC Group tracking stock and holders of Ventures Group tracking stock or to the holders of different series of stock, and none of the holders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock will have a separate class vote in the event of such a merger or consolidation. Consistent with applicable principles of Delaware law, our board of directors will seek to divide the type and amount of consideration received in a merger or consolidation involving our company among holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock in a fair manner. As the different ways the board of directors may divide the consideration between holders of stock relating to the different groups, and among holders of different series of a particular stock, might have materially different results, the consideration to be received by holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock in any such merger or consolidation may be materially less valuable than the consideration they would have received if they had a separate class vote on such merger or consolidation.
 We may dispose of assets of the QVC Group or the Ventures Group without your approval. Delaware law requires stockholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of our company taken as a whole, and our restated charter does not require a separate class vote in the case of a sale of a significant amount of assets of any of our groups. As long as the assets attributed to the QVC Group or the Ventures Group proposed to be disposed of represent less than substantially all of our assets, we may approve sales and other dispositions of any amount of the assets of such group without any stockholder approval.
 If we dispose of all or substantially all of the assets attributed to any group (which means, for this purpose, assets representing 80% of the fair market value of the total assets of the disposing group, as determined by our board of directors), we would be required, if the disposition is not an exempt disposition under the terms of our restated charter, to choose one or more of the following three alternatives:

· | declare and pay a dividend on the disposing group's common stock;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | redeem shares of the disposing group's common stock in exchange for cash, securities or other property; and/or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  I-33

 


· | convert all or a portion of the disposing group's outstanding common stock into common stock of the other group.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In this type of a transaction, holders of the disposing group's common stock may receive less value than the value that a third-party buyer might pay for all or substantially all of the assets of the disposing group.
 Our board of directors will decide, in its sole discretion, how to proceed and is not required to select the option that would result in the highest value to holders of any group of our common stock.
 Holders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to that group than if that group were a separate company. If the QVC Group or the Ventures Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of that sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, stockholders of a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount of proceeds than the holders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock would receive upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the group to which their shares relate. In addition, we cannot assure our stockholders that in the event of such a sale the per share consideration to be paid to holders of QVC Group tracking stock or Ventures Group tracking stock, as the case may be, will be equal to or more than the per share value of that share of stock prior to or after the announcement of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the applicable group. Further, there is no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-free to the holders of the shares of common stock of that group. Accordingly, if we sell all or substantially all of the assets attributed to the QVC Group or the Ventures Group, our stockholders could suffer a loss in the value of their investment in our company.
 In the event of a liquidation of Liberty, holders of Ventures Group tracking stock and QVC Group tracking stock will not have a priority with respect to the assets attributed to the related tracking stock group remaining for distribution to stockholders.  Under the restated charter, upon Liberty's liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of the Ventures Group tracking stock and the QVC Group tracking stock will be entitled to receive, in respect of their shares of such stock, their proportionate interest in all of Liberty's assets, if any, remaining for distribution to holders of common stock in proportion to their respective number of "liquidation units" per share. Relative liquidation units were determined based on the volume weighted average prices of the Ventures Group tracking stock and the QVC Group tracking stock over the 20 trading day period which commenced shortly after the initial filing of the restated charter. Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder of either tracking stock upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Liberty will have nothing to do with the value of the assets attributed to the related tracking stock group or to changes in the relative value of the QVC Group tracking stock and the Ventures Group tracking stock over time.
 Our board of directors may in its sole discretion elect to convert the common stock relating to one group into common stock relating to the other group, thereby changing the nature of your investment and possibly diluting your economic interest in our company, which could result in a loss in value to you. Our restated charter permits our board of directors, in its sole discretion, to convert all of the outstanding shares of common stock relating to either of our groups into shares of common stock of the other group on specified terms.  A conversion would preclude the holders of stock in each group involved in such conversion from retaining their investment in a security that is intended to reflect separately the performance of the relevant group. We cannot predict the impact on the market value of our stock of (1) our board of directors' ability to effect any such conversion or (2) the exercise of this conversion right by our company. In addition, our board of directors may effect such a conversion at a time when the market value of our stock could cause the stockholders of one group to be disadvantaged.
 Holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock will vote together and will have limited separate voting rights. Holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock will vote together as a single class, except in certain limited circumstances prescribed by our restated charter and under Delaware law. Each share of Series B common stock of each group has ten votes per share, and each share of Series A common stock of each group has one vote per share. Holders of Series C common stock of each group have no voting rights, other than those required under Delaware law. When holders of QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock vote together as a single class, holders having a majority of the votes will be in a position to control the outcome of the vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among our stockholders or has a greater impact on one group than the other.

 Transactions in our common stock by our insiders could depress the market price of our common stock. Sales of or hedging transactions such as collars relating to our shares by our Chairman of the Board or any of our other directors or executive officers could cause a perception in the marketplace that our stock price has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our company. This perception can result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these insider transactions. As a result, insider transactions could depress the market price for shares of one or more series of our tracking stocks.
 Our capital structure, as well as the fact that the QVC Group and the Ventures Group are not independent companies, may inhibit or prevent acquisition bids for the QVC Group or the Ventures Group and may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders. If the QVC Group and the Ventures Group were separate independent companies, any person interested in acquiring the QVC Group or the Ventures Group without negotiating with management could seek control of that group by obtaining control of its outstanding voting stock, by means of a tender offer, or by means of a proxy contest. Although we intend QVC Group tracking stock and Ventures Group tracking stock to reflect the separate economic performance of the QVC Group and the Ventures Group, respectively, those groups are not separate entities and a person interested in acquiring only one group without negotiation with our management could obtain control of that group only by obtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our company. The existence of shares of common stock, and different series of shares, relating to different groups could present complexities and in certain circumstances pose obstacles, financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not present in companies that do not have capital structures similar to ours.
 Certain provisions of our restated charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:

· | authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock, a Series B common stock of each group that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A common stock of each group that entitles the holder to one vote per share, and a Series C common stock of each group that except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holder to no voting rights;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our aggregate voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our restated charter; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the existence of authorized and unissued stock, including "blank check" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to persons friendly to our then current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of our company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our chairman, John C. Malone, beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 38% of the aggregate voting power in our company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 94% and 94% of the outstanding shares of each of our Series B QVC Group common stock and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock, respectively, as of January 31, 2017.
