Item 1.    Business Overview
Callaway Golf Company (the “Company,” “Callaway” or “Callaway Golf”) was incorporated in California in 1982 with the main purpose of designing, manufacturing and selling high quality golf clubs. The Company became a publicly traded corporation in 1992, and in 1999, reincorporated in the State of Delaware. The Company has evolved over time from a manufacturer of golf clubs to a leading manufacturer and distributor of a full line of premium golf equipment and accessories. More recently, in an effort to diversify and explore new growth opportunities, the Company expanded its soft goods business to include lifestyle product lines that are complementary to golf. In 2017, the Company expanded its soft goods business with the acquisitions of OGIO International, Inc. ("OGIO"), a leading manufacturer and distributor of premium storage gear for sport and personal use, and TravisMathew, LLC ("TravisMathew"), a leading designer and distributor of premium golf and lifestyle apparel, gear and accessories. In January 2019, the Company acquired JW Stargazer Holding GmbH, the owner of the international, premium outdoor apparel, footwear and equipment brand, Jack Wolfskin ("Jack Wolfskin"), which further enhanced the Company's lifestyle category and provided a platform in the active outdoor and urban outdoor categories. 
In October 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Topgolf International, Inc. (“Topgolf”) in an all-stock transaction (the "Merger"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Topgolf and 51 Steps, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Callaway (“Merger Sub”). The Merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2021, after which the former Topgolf stockholders (other than the Company) are expected to own approximately 48.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis.
Reportable Segments and Products
Golf Equipment
The Company designs, manufactures and sells a full line of high quality golf equipment, which is comprised of the golf clubs and golf balls product groups. The Company designs its golf products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year.

Product Design and Development
Product design at the Company for all of its brands is a result of the integrated efforts of its brand management, research and development, manufacturing and sales departments, all of which work together to generate new ideas for the Company's golf equipment and apparel and soft goods lines. The Company believes it has created a work environment in which new ideas are valued and explored. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company invested $46.3 million, $50.6 million and $40.8 million, respectively, in research and development. The Company intends to continue to invest substantial amounts in its research and development activities in connection with its development of new golf products and soft goods lines.
The Company designs its golf equipment products to be technologically advanced and has not limited itself in its research efforts by trying to duplicate designs that are traditional or conventional. The Company has the ability to create and modify product designs by using computer aided design (“CAD”) software, finite element analysis (“FEA”) software and structural optimization techniques employing Artificial Intelligence methods. Further, the Company utilizes a variety of testing equipment and computer software, including golf robots, launch monitors, a proprietary virtual test center, a proprietary performance analysis system, an indoor test range and other methods to develop and test its golf equipment products. Through the use of these technologies, the Company has been able to innovate and enhance product performance at the same time accelerating the design, development and testing of new golf clubs and golf balls.
The Company's soft goods under the Callaway, OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin brands are designed and developed internally and created through manufacturing partners who source materials and create the products according to the Company's brands' specifications. 
For certain risks associated with product design and development, see below, “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Manufacturing and Distribution
The Company has its primary golf club assembly facility in Monterrey, Mexico, and maintains limited golf club assembly in its facilities in Carlsbad, California. In addition, used clubs that the Company receives from its Trade-In Trade-Up program are refurbished at its facility in Austin, Texas. The Company's golf clubs are also assembled in Tokyo, Japan, Swindon, England, Melbourne, Australia and other local markets based on regional demand for custom clubs. In addition, the Company utilizes golf club contract manufacturers in China and Vietnam. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, most of the Company’s golf club assembly volume was made in regions outside of the United States. Overall, the golf club assembly process is fairly labor intensive, requires extensive global supply chain coordination and utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States. 
The Company has a golf ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts, and also utilizes golf ball contract manufacturers in Taiwan and China. In 2020, approximately 70% of the Company's golf ball unit volume was manufactured in regions outside of the United States. In each of 2019 and 2018, approximately 60% of the Company's golf ball unit volume was manufactured in regions outside of the United States. The overall golf ball manufacturing process utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States.
The Company utilizes third-party contract manufacturers for its Callaway, OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin soft goods products located in various countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Thailand, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Peru.
The Company has its primary distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas for the distribution of goods in North America, in addition to distribution centers in Toronto, Canada; Swindon, England; Melbourne, Australia; Hamburg, Germany; and Shanghai, China, and third-party logistical operations in Tokyo, Japan and Seoul, Korea to support the distribution needs of markets they serve.
For certain risks associated with manufacturing and distribution, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Sales and Marketing
The Company sells its golf equipment and soft goods products in the United States and internationally in over 120 countries worldwide, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to wholesale customers and directly to consumers through its retail locations and on-line through its websites. The Company also sells certified pre-owned golf clubs directly to consumers or through certain authorized retailers. In addition, the Company licenses its trademarks and service marks in exchange for a royalty fee to third parties for use on certain golf related apparel and accessories. 
Of the Company’s total net sales, approximately 49%, 46% and 57% were derived from sales to customers within the United States in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and approximately 51%, 54% and 43% were derived from sales for distribution outside of the United States in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the Company's international business in 2019 was primarily due to the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019. Jack Wolfskin conducts its business predominantly in Europe and China. 
The majority of the Company’s international sales are made through its wholly-owned subsidiaries located primarily in Europe, Japan, China, Korea, Canada and Australia. In addition to sales through its subsidiaries, the Company also sells through its network of distributors in over 50 foreign countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Africa, and in numerous countries in Central and South America. Sales to distributors outside of the United States generally reflect an export pricing discount to compensate international distributors for selling and distribution costs. 
Sales of the Company’s products in the United States and internationally are made and supported through its vast network of field representatives and in-house sales and customer service representatives who work together to initiate and maintain relationships with customers through frequent telephone calls and in-person visits. 
For its golf equipment business, the Company also has a separate team of club fitting specialists who focus on the Company’s custom club sales. A portion of the Company’s custom club sales are generated from the utilization of club fitting programs, such as performance centers, which utilize high-speed cameras and precision software to capture relevant swing data. All performance centers and participating on- and off-course retail stores are equipped with custom fitting systems that incorporate the use of an extensive variety of clubhead and shaft combinations in order to find a set of golf clubs that fits a golfer’s personal specifications. The Company believes that offering golfers the opportunity to increase performance with custom club specifications increases sales and promotes brand loyalty.
In addition, the Company sells to corporate customers who want their corporate logo imprinted or embroidered on certain of the Company’s golf equipment, golf bags and apparel. The Company imprints or embroiders the logos on the majority of these corporate products directly or through third parties who adhere to the Company's quality control policies. The Company also pays a commission to certain on- and off-course professionals and retailers with whom it has a relationship for corporate sales that are initiated through such professionals and retailers.
The Company maintains various sales programs in the United States, including a Preferred Retailer Program. The Preferred Retailer Program offers potential rebates and discounts for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training. The Company’s sales programs in foreign countries are specifically designed based upon local laws and competitive conditions. Some of the sales programs utilized include the custom club fitting experiences and the Preferred Retailer Program or variations of those programs employed in the United States.
For certain risks associated with sales outside the United States, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.

Sales of Pre-Owned Clubs
The Company sells certified pre-owned golf products in addition to golf-related accessories through its website www.callawaygolfpreowned.com. The Company generally acquires the pre-owned products through the Company’s Trade In! Trade Up! program, which gives golfers the opportunity to trade in their used Callaway Golf clubs and certain competitor golf clubs at authorized Callaway Golf retailers or through the Callaway Golf Pre-Owned website for credit toward the purchase of new or pre-owned Callaway Golf equipment. 
Licensing
The Company, in exchange for a royalty fee, licenses its trademarks and service marks to third parties for use on products such as golf apparel and footwear, and practice aids. With respect to its line of golf apparel, the Company has current licensing arrangements with Perry Ellis International for a complete line of men’s and women’s apparel for distribution in certain retail channels in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. With respect to OGIO-branded bags, the Company has a licensing arrangement with SanMar Corporation for OGIO products and SanMar-designed, OGIO-branded products for distribution in the corporate channel in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In addition, the Company licenses its trademarks to other third parties, including IZZO Golf for practice aids and sunglasses and Walman Optical for a line of prescription Callaway eyewear.
Advertising and Promotion
The Company develops and executes its advertising and promotional campaigns for its products based on the Company’s global brand principles. The Company's target audience varies by the different products and brands in its portfolio. For the golf equipment and golf related accessories products within the United States, the Company has focused its advertising efforts mainly on television commercials, primarily on The Golf Channel, and on network television during golf telecasts, web-based digital and social media advertising, printed advertisements in national magazines, such as Golf Magazine and Golf Digest, as well as in-store advertising. The Company also engages in non-traditional marketing activities through strategic investments in third parties, including Topgolf, with whom the Company entered into a Merger Agreement in October 2020.
Advertising of the Company’s golf equipment products outside of the United States is generally handled by the Company’s subsidiaries, and while it is based on the Company’s global brand principles, the local execution is tailored to each region based on its unique consumer market and lifestyles.
The OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin soft goods product lines are marketed towards audiences beyond the golf equipment and golf related accessories products. The Company uses a variety of channels to advertise and promote such products, including social media, branded retail stores, traditional digital and print publications, and experiential events. 
In addition, the Company establishes relationships with professional athletes and personalities in order to promote the Company’s products. The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional golf tours to promote the Company’s golf club and golf ball products as well as golf bags and various golf accessories. The Company has also entered into arrangements with other athletes and personalities to promote its OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin-branded products. For certain risks associated with such endorsements, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Competition
The golf club markets in which the Company competes are highly competitive and are served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names. With respect to drivers, fairway woods and irons, the Company’s major competitors are TaylorMade, Ping, Acushnet (Titleist brand), Puma (Cobra brand), SRI Sports Limited (Cleveland and Srixon brands), Mizuno, Bridgestone, and Parsons Xtreme Golf (PXG). For putters, the Company’s major competitors are Acushnet (Titleist brand), Ping and TaylorMade. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in every golf club market in which it competes.
The golf ball business is also highly competitive. There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including Acushnet (Titleist and Pinnacle brands), SRI Sports Limited (Dunlop and Srixon brands), Bridgestone (Bridgestone and Precept brands), TaylorMade and others. These competitors compete for market share in the golf ball business, with Acushnet having a market share of over 50% of the golf ball business in the United States and a leading position in certain other regions outside the United States. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in the golf ball category.
For both golf clubs and golf balls, the Company generally competes on the basis of technology, quality, performance, customer service and price. In order to gauge the effectiveness of the Company’s response to such factors, management receives and evaluates Company-generated market trends for U.S. and foreign markets, as well as periodic public and customized market research for the U.S. and U.K. markets from Golf Datatech and NGF that include trends from certain on- and off-course retailers. In addition, the Company utilizes GfK Group for markets in Japan.
In addition, the Company's competitors in the soft goods market vary by product. For golf apparel and accessories, the competitors are generally other golf companies and premium golf apparel companies, as well as specialty retailers. While the TravisMathew business faces competition from the premium golf apparel companies, they also compete in department stores with other men’s apparel companies, including Bonobos, johnnie-O, Nike, Peter Millar, Ted Baker London and Vince. With the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business, there are a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names with which the Company competes, including Patagonia, Columbia and The North Face. The Company seeks to differentiate itself through elevated design, premium materials and product innovation. 
For certain risks associated with competition, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Seasonality of Company's Business
Golf Equipment
In most of the regions where the Company conducts business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis. Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company’s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months. The Company’s golf equipment business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations. In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its golf club and golf ball products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter. Second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter. Third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but can also include smaller new product launches, typically resulting in lower sales than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season. Fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company’s key regions. However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year product launch, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year. This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions. In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company’s sales from its Golf Equipment operating segment and most, if not all, of its profitability from this segment generally occurs during the first half of the year. 
Apparel, Gear and Other
Sales of the Company's golf and lifestyle apparel, gear and accessories generally follow the same seasonality as golf equipment, and are therefore generally higher during the first half of the year when the game of golf is mostly played. Sales of outdoor apparel, footwear and equipment related to the Jack Wolfskin business focus primarily on outerwear and consequently experience stronger sales for such products during the cold-weather months and the corresponding prior sell-in periods. Therefore, sales of Jack Wolfskin product are generally greater during the second half of the year.
Environmental and Social Responsibility
 By being active and visible in the community and by embracing the principles of environmental stewardship, the Company believes it is acting in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. In 2019, the Company, at the direction of its Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors, launched the Sustainability Program, covering its global footprint with direction to enhance and improve the Company’s overall performance in the sustainability space. Core team members, known as Sustainability Champions, have been selected from throughout the organization to drive large scale global projects which build on the Company’s ongoing environmental and social sustainability efforts, as well as to promote smaller scale employee-driven initiatives at the local level. These projects and initiatives are benchmarked against the sustainability frameworks published by the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") with respect to sustainability issues that are likely to affect the financial conditions or operating performances of companies in the consumer goods and apparel sectors. In connection with the launching of the Sustainability Program, the Company established the Executive Sustainability Committee comprised of its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other executive officers. The progress made through the Sustainability Program is reported quarterly to the Executive Sustainability Committee and annually to the Board of Directors. 
Environmental Matters
The Company’s operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants (collectively, “Environmental Laws”). In the ordinary course of its manufacturing processes, the Company uses paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generates waste by-products that are subject to these Environmental Laws. In addition, in connection with the Company's Top-Flite asset acquisition in 2003, the Company assumed certain monitoring and remediation obligations at its manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts. In February 2013, the Company sold this facility and leased back a reduced portion of the square footage that it believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations. As part of the terms of this sale, the Company assumed certain ongoing environmental remediation obligations.
The Company endeavors to adhere to all applicable Environmental Laws and takes action as necessary to comply with these laws. The Company maintains an environmental and safety program and employs full-time environmental, health and safety professionals at its facilities located in Carlsbad, California, Chicopee, Massachusetts and Monterrey, Mexico. The environmental and safety program includes obtaining environmental permits as required, capturing and appropriately disposing of any waste by-products, tracking hazardous waste generation and disposal, air emissions, safety situations, material safety data sheet management, storm water management and recycling, and auditing and reporting on its compliance. The Company conducts third party social, safety and environmental responsibility audits to evaluate and improve its environmental performance through its global supply chain. The audits facilitate compliance with applicable Environmental Laws and good manufacturing practices within the global supply chain.
Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, the Company cannot predict with certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable Environmental Laws.
Social Matters
The Company maintains a Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy, which establish the foundation of its Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") Program that was established in 2007. In 2019, the Company updated its CSR audit policy and procedure, benchmarking against the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labor Organization Guidelines. The Company takes actions as necessary to ensure supplier compliance, and actively works with suppliers to improve performance through training, internal and third-party audits and corrective action plan validation. The Company employs a team to conduct and oversee corporate social responsibility audits globally and has not identified any material compliance issues with its suppliers to date.
In addition to the CSR Program, the Company participates in environmental, social and product compliance working groups through the American Apparel and Footwear Association ("AAFA") and is a signatory to the Responsible Recruiting Commitment and Cambodia (Worker’s Rights) Brand Letter. Also, Jack Wolfskin’s engagement in the Fair Wear Foundation promotes social responsibility and transparency in the supply chain.
Sustainability Program
The Company believes it is important to conduct its business in an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable manner. In this regard, the Company’s Sustainability Program focuses on initiatives across various environmental and social pillars, some of which are listed below, which have been benchmarked against recognized environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) guidelines. As part of the Sustainability Program, these efforts are discussed amongst the Sustainability Core Team to aid in collaboration and best practice sharing/implementation across the Company’s brands, product categories, and regions. Examples of these efforts are visible in the following areas within the Company:
