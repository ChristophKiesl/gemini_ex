Professional Services and Support 
 In addition to cloud-based solutions that meet the specific needs of our life sciences customers, we also offer professional services to help customers maximize the value they get from those solutions. The people on these teams have a combination of life sciences industry expertise, project management skills and deep technical acumen that we believe our customers highly value. Our professional services are offered directly to customers or through our systems integrator partners. Our professional services teams work together with our systems integrator partners to deliver projects. We offer professional services in the following areas: 

• | implementation and deployment planning and project management;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements analysis, solution design and configuration;
--+----------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------


• | ongoing managed services, such as outsourced systems administration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our professional services teams are organized by specific expertise so that they can provide advice and support for best industry practices in the research and development and commercial departments of our customers. 
 Our global systems integrator partners also deliver implementation and selected support services to customers who wish to utilize them. Our customers include Accenture, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Consulting and other life sciences specialty firms.
 Our Customers 
 As of January 31, 2017, we served 517 customers. For an explanation of how we define current customers, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Components of Results of Operations.” We deliver solutions to companies throughout the life sciences industry, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical products, contract sales organizations, and contract research organizations. Our customers range from the largest global pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer AG, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., and Novartis International AG, to smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including Alkermes plc, Grupo Ferrer Internacional S.A., Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and LEO Pharma A/S. For our fiscal years ended January 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, we did not have any single customer that represented more than 10% of our total revenues. For a summary of our financial information by geographic location, see note 14 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
Our Culture and Employees 
 We have built our company culture on making customers successful and responding to our customers’ needs with speed. It is our aim to be among the few most trusted information technology partners that the life sciences industry works with on its most important data and information technology needs. The deep partnerships we forge with our customers help us shape our offerings to best meet industry needs and allow us to extend those relationships by providing additional solutions across a wide breadth of business areas. With a track record of ongoing, industry leading innovation and a steadfast commitment to our customers’ success we believe we are well positioned to continue to help the industry address a broader range of challenges and opportunities. We also believe our customer success focus provides a strategic advantage in our business development and sales efforts, as customers are strong advocates and refer others to our solutions. 
 We have carefully built our culture by recruiting, selecting and developing employees who are highly focused on delivering success for customers. This is a crucial element of our hiring and evaluation processes throughout all departments. We believe this approach produces high levels of customer success and employee success. 
 We also believe we provide employees a unique opportunity to develop and sell world-class, cloud-based applications and platforms within a specific industry. Historically, software developers had to choose between developing platforms for a broad, but generic set of customers, and building industry-specific solutions with limited further applicability. Our industry cloud approach empowers developers to build important applications and platforms that can become the standard in our industry while enabling sales personnel to sell a growing portfolio of solutions to a focused, deep set of life sciences companies. We believe that this unique opportunity will allow us to continue to attract top talent for our product development and sales efforts.

As of January 31, 2017, we employed 1,794 people. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good. 
 Technology Infrastructure and Operations 
 Our solutions utilize a pod-based architecture in multiple data centers that allow for scalability, operational simplicity and security. Our solutions are hosted in data centers located in the United States, the European Union and Japan. We utilize third-parties to provide our data center infrastructure and manage the infrastructure on which our solutions operate. We utilize industry standard hardware and architect our solutions using redundant configurations to minimize service interruptions. We also utilize a highly available domain name service provider to reduce the potential for network-related disruptions. 
 Our technology is based on multitenant architectures that apply common, consistent management practices for all customers using our solutions. We enable multiple customers to share the same version of our solutions while securely partitioning their respective data. Portions of our multichannel customer relationship management applications are built on the Salesforce1 Platform. Our Veeva Vault and Veeva Network solutions are built upon our own proprietary platforms. We built the proprietary portions of our technology stack using recognized open source components. In addition, we use Amazon Web Services, which provides a scalable, distributed computing and storage infrastructure platform, for certain computing and data intensive functions of our solutions, such as analytic reporting, large data set manipulation and primary and redundant storage.
 We continually monitor our infrastructure for any sign of failure or pending failure, and we take preemptive action to attempt to minimize or prevent downtime. Our data centers employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity and security, including redundant power and cooling systems, fire and flood prevention mechanisms, continual security coverage, biometric readers at entry points and anonymous exteriors. We also implement various disaster recovery measures, including full replication of hardware and data in our geographically distinct data centers, such that data loss would be minimized in the event of a single data center disaster. 
 All users are authenticated, authorized and validated before they can access our solutions. Users must have a valid user ID and associated password to log on to our solutions. Our configurable security model allows different groups of users to have different levels of access to our solutions. Our solutions’ vulnerability is tested using internal tools prior to release, and we employ a third party to perform penetration and vulnerability tests on our solutions on at least an annual basis. 
 Veeva has designed and implemented an information security management system, or ISMS, that is aligned with our customers’ standards for information security practices. Our ISMS has successfully undergone ISO 27001 certification.
 We also obtain independent third-party audit opinions related to security and availability annually, such as a Service Organization Controls, or SOC 2, Type II report, and ISO 27001 attestation reports. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our solutions through our direct sales organization. 
 At a high level, life sciences companies are typically organized by the major functions of research and development for the creation and development of new solutions, and commercial, for the sales and marketing of those solutions once they are approved for use. In large life sciences companies, research and development and commercial business lines may also have separate technology and business decision makers. Accordingly, we market and sell our solutions to align with the distinct characteristics of the research and development buyer and the commercial buyer. In our largest regions, we have distinct research and development and commercial sales teams. Each of these teams is further divided to sell to the largest global pharmaceutical companies and to smaller life sciences companies. 
 We believe the combination of our industry-focus and commitment to customer success provides strategic advantages and allows us to more efficiently market and sell our solutions as compared to horizontal cloud-based companies. We further believe that the marketplace is increasingly recognizing the benefits of cloud based solutions over on premise packaged and custom software solutions, which further enhances our ability to compete with that class of competitors. Our awareness, demand generation and sales cultivation programs are highly targeted to life sciences industry buyers. We believe that we further benefit from word-of-mouth marketing as customers endorse our solutions to their industry peers. This allows us to focus our sales and marketing efforts without the need for a larger number of sales executives.

If either party elects not to renew the agreement or if the agreement is terminated by us as a result of salesforce.com’s breach, the agreement provides for a five-year wind-down period in which we would be able to continue providing the Salesforce1 Platform as combined with the proprietary aspects of our solutions to our existing customers but would be limited with respect to the number of additional subscriptions we could sell to our existing customers. We believe that we have a mutually beneficial strategic relationship with salesforce.com. 
 Quality and Compliance 
 Our customers use our solutions for business activities that are subject to a complex regime of country and region specific healthcare laws and regulations across the globe. In order to best serve our customers, we must ensure that the data processed by our systems are accurate and secure and that they retain the level of confidentiality and privacy commensurate with the type of information managed. To comply with IT healthcare regulations, industry-specific capabilities must be designed for and embedded in all of our solutions. These capabilities include: robust audit trail tracking, compliant electronic signature capture, data encryption and secure access controls. In addition to design requirements, our solutions must be thoroughly tested to comply with the regulations that apply to electronic record keeping systems for the life sciences industry, which include: 

Regulation | Regulation Description 
---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 CFR 820.75 | U.S. FDA device regulation on system validation 
21 CFR 211.68 | U.S. FDA pharma GMP regulation on system validation 
21 CFR 11 | U.S. FDA requirement for maintenance of electronic records 
EU Annex 11 | EU GMP requirement for maintenance of electronic records 
21 CFR 203 | Drug sample tracking as required by the Prescription Drug Marketing Act 
PFSB Notification, No. 0401022 (Japan) | Use of Electromagnetic Records and Electronic Signatures for Approval of, or License for, Drugs

Each version of our solutions that are subject to regulations that require companies to maintain certain records and submit information to regulators as part of compliance verification undergoes validation testing against these and other relevant standards. Veeva develops a validation plan, performs installation qualification and operational qualification, and executes the protocols. The results of each independent validation are then reviewed and confirmed in a summary report by our quality and compliance team. As such, we maintain a dedicated team of quality and compliance experts that manages our processes for meeting the requirements of the FDA and other global life sciences regulatory agencies. The functions of this quality and compliance team include three separate domains: 
  
• | quality systems oversees resource management, document management, computer validation, corrective and preventative action, and general quality oversight;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance oversees audit and inspection management, supplier management, and regulatory intelligence; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the security office oversees information security and security awareness training and security incident response.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Veeva has designed and implemented a quality management system (“QMS”) that is aligned with our customers’ regulatory standards for IT compliance. Our QMS is maintained in our own Veeva Vault QualityDocs application. A compliant QMS in the healthcare regulated environment consists of the following: 
  
• | a comprehensive set of quality policies and procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | an independent quality assurance function that oversees development and maintenance of our software;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | audit support of our customers’ regulatory obligation to perform due diligence on their suppliers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | computer systems validation aligned with healthcare industry best practices as outlined in published regulatory standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a resource management program to ensure employees have the requisite demonstrable level of education, experience, and training;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a risk management program to identify product realization and other business risks; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an information security program to ensure IT controls conform to established standards.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With respect to privacy and data protection, we comply with the patient privacy rules under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 that protect medical records and other personal health information by signing business associate agreements when requested by our customers.
 In the European Union, Veeva is a registered data controller for data used in our Veeva OpenData and Veeva KOL Data solutions and a data processor for our remaining applications, each as defined by the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. We are in the process of preparing our compliance plan for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and e-Privacy Regulation reforms, which enter into force on May 25, 2018. In December 2016, we successfully self-certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Additionally, we routinely execute EU Standard Contractual Clauses, often referred to as Model Clauses, to legally facilitate international transfers of EU personal data. 
 Our quality and compliance team also manages the process of customer audits, which is often a required due diligence step in customer purchase decisions. We believe our approach to quality and compliance reflects our focus on customer success and is a competitive differentiator.
 Research and Development 
 Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of our solutions and applications. Based on customer feedback and needs, we focus our efforts on developing new solutions functionality, applications and core technologies and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing solutions and applications. 
 Research and development expenses were $41.2 million, $66.0 million and $96.8 million for our fiscal years ended January 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Competition 
 The markets for our solutions are global, rapidly evolving, highly competitive and subject to changing regulations, advancing technology and shifting customer needs. The solutions and applications offered by our competitors vary in size, breadth and scope. 
 Our multichannel customer relationship management applications compete with offerings from large global enterprise software vendors, such as Oracle Corporation, and also compete with life sciences-specific customer relationship management providers, such as QuintilesIMS. We also compete with a number of vendors of cloud-based and on-premise customer relationship management applications that address only a portion of the functionality of our customer relationship management solutions. Veeva Vault, our regulated content and information management solutions, competes with offerings from large global content management platform vendors such as Microsoft Corporation, OpenText Corporation and Oracle, and with offerings from life sciences specific providers, such as Medidata Solutions, Inc., PAREXEL International Corporation, BioClinica, Inc. and Sparta Technologies Ltd. We also compete with professional services companies that provide solutions on these platforms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation. In the future, providers of horizontal cloud-based storage or file sharing products, such as Box.com or Amazon Web Services, may seek to compete with our regulated content and information management solutions. In addition, we recently announced that we have begun selling Veeva Vault to companies in process and discrete manufacturing and highly regulated services industries. We have no experience selling certain of our Veeva Vault applications to companies in process and discrete manufacturing and highly regulated services industries, and therefore we anticipate having to compete with many existing solutions, including those listed above, custom-built software developed by third-party vendors or in-house by our potential customers and niche software providers. Our master data management solutions compete with master data software offerings from vendors such as IBM Corporation, Informatica Corporation, and other smaller providers, such as Reltio, Inc.. Our data and data services offerings compete with QuintilesIMS and many other data providers.
 We may also face competition from custom-built software developed by third-party vendors or developed in-house by our potential customers, or from applications built by our customers or by third parties on behalf of our customers using commercially available software platforms that are provided by third parties. We may also face competition from companies that provide cloud-based solutions in different target or horizontal markets that may develop applications or work with companies that operate in our target markets. With the introduction of new technologies, we expect competition to intensify in the future, and we may face competition from new market entrants as well.
 In some cases, our competitors are well-established providers of competitive solutions and have long-standing relationships with many of our current and potential customers, including large pharmaceutical and emerging biopharmaceutical companies. Oracle and QuintilesIMS, for example, each have greater name recognition, a much longer operating history, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. 
 Many of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we are able. Such competitors may be able to initiate or withstand substantial price competition, and may offer solutions competitive to certain of our solutions on a standalone basis at a lower price or bundled as part of a larger product sale, including the bundling of software solutions and data. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers that we do not have. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources.
 In addition, in order to take advantage of customer demand for cloud-based solutions, such competitors may expand their cloud-based solutions through acquisitions and organic development or may seek to partner with other leading cloud providers. For instance, in April 2015, IMS Health Holding, Inc. acquired the information solutions and CRM businesses of Cegedim SA. The combined entity competed with us in a number of product areas, including software solutions, data and data services. Further, in October 2016, IMS Health Holding, Inc. and Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc., a contract research organization, combined in an all-stock merger of equals to form Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., which operates under the name QuintilesIMS. The impact of this transaction on our competitive environment is uncertain but increased competition from QuintilesIMS could negatively impact our business. 
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: 
  
• | level of customer satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------


• | regulatory compliance verification and functionality;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | domain expertise with respect to life sciences;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | ease of deployment and use of solutions and applications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 14


 
• | breadth and depth of solution and application functionality;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


• | modern and adaptive technology platform;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | capability for customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of applications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | size of customer base and level of user adoption; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors and that the domain expertise required for developing and deploying successful solutions in the life sciences industry may hinder new entrants that are unable to invest the necessary capital to develop solutions that can address the functionality, requirements and regulatory compliance capabilities needed for the life sciences industry. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance in the areas of solution and application development and customer support. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have developed a process for seeking patent protection for our technology innovations. To date, we have secured seven U.S. patents and two Japanese patents, which expire between May 2023 and October 2035, and we have 24 pending U.S. patent applications and four pending international patent applications. We plan to continue expanding our patent portfolio. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on our intellectual property rights, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our applications are essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position as provider of software solutions and applications to the life sciences industry. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our application. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and protection of our rights through civil enforcement mechanisms may be expensive and time consuming. 
 Companies in our industry often own a number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. We are currently engaged in legal proceedings with competitors in which the competitors are asserting trade misappropriation and other claims, and we may face new allegations in the future that we have infringed the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of other competitors or non-practicing entities. We expect that we and others in our industry will continue to be subject to third-party infringement claims by competitors as the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps, and by non-practicing entities. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
