Item 1. Business Overview
We provide a technology solution to automate the purchase and sale of advertising for buyers and sellers. We believe our highly scalable platform reaches approximately one billion Internet users globally on some of the world’s leading websites and mobile applications. We help increase the volume and effectiveness of advertising, improving revenue for sellers and return on advertising investment for buyers. 
Advertising takes different forms, referred to as advertising units, and is purchased and sold through different transactional methodologies, referred to as inventory types. Finally, it is presented to users through different channels. Our solution enables buyers and sellers to purchase and sell:
•a comprehensive range of advertising units, including display and video;
•utilizing various inventory types, including (i) direct sale of premium inventory, which we refer to as Orders, on a guaranteed, or fully reserved basis, as well as on a non-guaranteed basis; and (ii) real-time bidding, or RTB;
•across digital channels, including mobile web, mobile application, and desktop, as well as across various out of home channels, such as digital billboards, that are in the early stages of leveraging our advertising automation platform.
Our platform features applications and services for digital advertising sellers, including websites, mobile applications and other digital media properties, to sell their advertising inventory; applications and services for buyers, including advertisers, agencies, agency trading desks, demand side platforms, or DSPs, and ad networks, to buy advertising inventory; and a marketplace over which such transactions are executed. Together, these features power and enhance a comprehensive, transparent, independent advertising marketplace that brings buyers and sellers together and facilitates intelligent decision-making and automated transaction execution for the advertising inventory we manage on our platform.
Sellers of digital advertising use our platform to improve revenue by accessing a global market of buyers representing top advertiser brands to monetize their advertising inventory across transaction types, advertising units, and channels. We also help sellers decrease costs and protect their brands and user experience.
At the same time, buyers leverage our platform to manage their advertising spending and reach their target audience across transaction types, advertising units, and channels, simplify order management and campaign tracking, obtain actionable insights into 
audiences for their advertising, and access impression-level purchasing from hundreds of sellers. We believe buyers use our platform because of our powerful solution and our direct relationships and integrations with some of the world’s largest sellers.
Our platform incorporates proprietary machine-learning algorithms, sophisticated data processing, high-volume storage, robust analytics capabilities, and a distributed infrastructure. We analyze billions of data points in real time to enable our solution to make approximately 300 data-driven decisions per transaction in milliseconds, and over 15 trillion bid requests per month. Our solution is constantly improving based on our systems’ ability to analyze and learn from vast volumes of data.
During the early stages of our business following our incorporation in April 2007, our solution helped sellers to automate their existing advertising network relationships to match the right buyer with each impression, as well as increase their revenue and decrease their costs. Between 2008 and 2009, we developed direct relationships with buyers and created applications to assist buyers to increase their return on investment. During 2010, we added real-time bidding, or RTB capabilities, allowing sellers’ inventory to be sold in an auction to buyers, creating a real time unified auction where buyers compete to purchase sellers’ advertising inventory. During 2012, we launched our private marketplace orders application, which allows sellers to connect directly with pre-approved buyers to execute direct sales of previously unsold advertising inventory. 
In 2014, we introduced the first-generation of our solution to automate the buying and selling of premium digital inventory on a fully reserved, or guaranteed, basis. In late 2014, we further expanded our orders automation technology and further increased our capabilities in the automated guaranteed market with the acquisition of two companies, iSocket, Inc., or iSocket, and Shiny Inc., or Shiny. The addition of iSocket and Shiny provided additional solutions to automate the buying and selling of direct-sold and guaranteed deals. Combined with our pre-existing orders technology, these acquisitions enabled us in 2015 to create a fully integrated solution for automating, streamlining, and managing the processes of direct buying and selling of guaranteed and non-guaranteed advertising.
In April 2015, we acquired Chango Inc. or Chango, an intent marketing technology company and integrated its operations into the operations of the Company. In the first quarter of 2017, we ceased operating the intent marketing solution that had derived from the acquisition. 
In 2015, we also significantly advanced our mobile capabilities through a combination of internal product development, strategic customer wins, driving increased revenue from existing buyer and seller customers, and international expansion. Part of this growth was due to the development and roll out of our Exchange API (xAPI) solution, one of the first commercially available server-to-server header bidding solutions, which allows us to connect directly with seller ad servers to view and bid on every impression in their marketplace. Sellers have embraced header bidding, a technology solution by which impressions that would previously have been exposed to different potential sources of demand in a sequence dictated by ad server placement are instead available for concurrent competitive bidding by demand sources that use header bidding tags that the seller accepts. 
In 2016, we entered the header bidding space with our FastLane solution, which grew rapidly. In addition, we began to focus further on development of our video solution, helping grow our product footprint to allow our sellers to sell video advertising across desktop or mobile platforms, and include instream, outstream and mobile-specific formats such as interstitials. This growth was due to a combination of product development and expansion of existing display customer relationships to include video inventory, both domestically and internationally. 
We operate our business on a worldwide basis, with an established operating presence in North America and Europe and a developing presence in Asia, Australia, and South America. Substantially all of our assets are U.S. assets. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries and operations perform primarily sales, marketing, and service functions. 
Our Industry
Continued Shift Towards Digital Advertising
The advertising industry is shifting from traditional advertising in analog and print media, such as newspapers, magazines, broadcast radio, and television, to digital advertising. This decades-long shift has resulted in content being increasingly delivered to users over the Internet, mobile networks, and digital television, creating an opportunity for buyers to target audiences more accurately using data-driven strategies and deliver more relevant advertising in real time on multiple screens. Buyers are able to utilize various technologies to analyze data relating to return on investment, demographics, user behavior, location, and other attributes that enable them to create and deliver targeted advertisements to users, which helps achieve specific advertising goals. As a result, digital advertising has the potential to drive return on advertising investment significantly higher than traditional print, broadcast radio, and television. Technological advances have also enabled sellers to sell their inventory on an impression-by-impression basis, as well as in bulk, making it easier for sellers to enhance the monetization of their inventory.

Complicated and Manual Workflow for Direct Buying and Selling of Digital Advertising
Due to the size and complexity of the advertising ecosystem and purchasing process, manual processes cannot effectively manage digital advertising at scale. In addition, both buyers and sellers are demanding more transparency, better controls and more relevant insights from their advertising purchases and sales. Buyers and sellers benefit from a platform that enables them to leverage the targeting capabilities of their proprietary data assets. This has created a need to automate the digital advertising industry and to simplify the process of buying and selling advertising.
A variety of factors make the digital advertising ecosystem highly complex and challenging to automate:

• | Perishable Inventory. An Internet user’s visit to a website or mobile application creates a unique opportunity to reach the user by inserting advertisements into one or more of the impressions designed into the website or mobile application. In order to generate revenue for a seller these impressions must be filled before the page content loads.


• | Complex Impression-Level Matching. Sellers aim to sell impressions in order to grow revenue while enhancing the users’ experience and preserving the sellers’ brand. Buyers seek to purchase impression-level inventory to improve targeting of specific audiences and return on investment for their advertising spending.


• | Large Multi-Variate Datasets. Trillions of data points relating to browsing behavior, geographic information, user preferences, engagement with an advertisement, and effectiveness of an advertisement are created as users visit sellers’ websites and mobile applications. Each piece of data represents a valuable piece of information that can facilitate and improve current and subsequent targeting and monetization of impressions.


• | Fragmented Buyer and Seller Base. There is an enormous number and variety of buyers and sellers of digital advertising.


• | Brand Security and Inventory Quality Concerns. Buyers want to avoid buying fraudulent inventory or being associated with content they consider inappropriate, competitive, or inconsistent with their advertising themes. Sellers want to prevent advertisements that are inappropriate, competitively sensitive, or otherwise do not comport with their brand image from appearing on their websites or mobile applications.


• | Consumer Experience Concerns. Consumers prefer digital advertising experiences that are relevant to their personal interests, non-intrusive, and do not detract from or slow down their enjoyment of digital content.


• | Large and Highly Unpredictable Traffic Volumes. The scale of user traffic and the dollar value of digital advertisements is growing and difficult to manage efficiently. A large seller may have tens of millions of users per month, creating hundreds of millions of monthly impressions. The volume of traffic for any given seller is extremely difficult to predict and requires a technology infrastructure that is large enough to handle variable volumes. As more advertising shifts to digital and digital advertising technologies evolve, larger and more diverse data processing capabilities are required.


• | Lack of Standardized Ad Formats and Data. An available advertising impression can vary based on a number of factors, such as seller, ad format, screen size, pricing mechanism, content type, and audience demographic. It is challenging for buyers to efficiently evaluate and bid on trillions of impressions that are based on hundreds of ad formats in the context of millions of highly customized data fields.


• | Diverse Technology Demands. Even as advertising is shifting from traditional to digital media, a shift is underway within the digital advertising ecosystem from desktop to mobile channels. Desktop and mobile digital advertising involve different challenges and rely upon different technologies, requiring significant technological capabilities and innovation.

Rubicon Project: Competitive Strengths of Our Platform in the Digital Advertising Marketplace
Rubicon Project was founded to address the inherent challenges associated with the digital advertising ecosystem and to enable a marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact in a highly efficient and safe manner.
Our technology platform creates and powers a marketplace for large numbers of buyers and sellers to readily buy and sell advertising at scale. Buyers can direct their spending towards the impressions that are of most value to them based on demographics, pricing, timing, and other targeting objectives. Sellers can improve revenue per impression, while adhering to their own specific rules around advertising that is permissible on their websites and mobile applications. Our platform enables the real-time exchange of high volumes of information in a transparent marketplace that in turn enables sellers to match buyers’ advertising campaigns with their available advertising inventory.
Serving a Broad Universe of Buyers and Sellers Across a Full Spectrum of Inventory Types, Advertising Units, and Channels
6

Advertising takes different forms, referred to as advertising units, and is purchased and sold through different transaction types. It is presented to users through different channels. The following are the three main transaction types available through our platform:
Guaranteed Orders—automates one-to-one guaranteed inventory purchases between buyers and sellers.
Non-Guaranteed Orders—automates one-to-one non-guaranteed inventory purchases arranged directly between specific buyers and sellers on the platform.
Real-Time Bidding—enables the sale and purchase of inventory on an impression-by-impression basis. Buyers are able to leverage our platform to select individual impressions that meet their targeting criteria and sellers are able to leverage our platform to auction their inventory on an impression-by-impression basis to increase revenue.
Buyers and sellers can use these different transaction types to purchase and sell diverse advertising units, including display, video, and audio appearing through different digital channels, including desktop, mobile, and web applications, as well as out-of-home channels such as digital billboards. By accommodating a full spectrum of digital advertising inventory through various transaction types, our solution provides greater coverage of websites and mobile applications owned by a range of sellers, and attracts all types of buyers, thereby giving buyers the ability to fulfill their audience needs in a cost-effective manner and increasing the price at which sellers’ inventory is sold.
Private Marketplace Solutions Provide Unique Access to Quality Supply and Facilitate Transactions
A significant portion of premium inventory is purchased and sold through private marketplaces, both on a guaranteed and non-guaranteed basis. Some sellers will continue to rely on their own sales forces for sales of premium inventory, but will benefit from automation to better price, match, and place campaigns, and to automate manual operations such as ad trafficking, quality assurance, and billing and collections. We have invested in workflow capabilities and automation of premium inventory transactions to enable sales teams to increase their productivity and process more sales of inventory at optimal prices. Workflow capabilities enable buyers and sellers to communicate directly and use shared data to execute campaigns. These capabilities support sales functions rather than replacing them, enhancing their adoption without friction. Buyers and sellers can also leverage their first-party data assets and third-party data assets in our platform to increase the value of the seller’s inventory and precision of the buyer’s targeting efforts. In addition, we believe that our guaranteed orders capabilities will help to position us to automate the purchase and sale of television advertising.
Big Data Analytics and Machine-Learning Algorithms
A core aspect of our value proposition is our big data and machine-learning platform that is able to discover unique insights from our massive data repositories containing proprietary information on trillions of bid requests and served advertisements. Our systems collect and analyze non-personally identifiable information such as pricing of advertisements, historical clearing prices, bid responses, what types of ads are allowed on a particular website, which sellers’ websites a buyer prefers, what ad formats are available to be served, advertisement size and location, where a user is located, which users a buyer wants to target, how many ads the user has seen, browser or device information, and sellers’ proprietary data about users. We have developed proprietary machine-learning algorithms that analyze billions of these data points to enable our solution to make approximately 300 data-driven decisions per transaction in real time and to execute approximately 15 trillion bid requests per month.
Dual Network Effects Drive an Efficient and Self-Improving Marketplace
Through our solution, sellers gain instant access to the world’s largest automated digital advertising buyers, including hundreds of DSPs and ad networks. Our platform offers sellers significant flexibility by enabling them to sell their advertising inventory in an automated fashion on an impression-by-impression basis, such as with RTB, in bulk, or in Orders pursuant to arrangements directly between the seller and the buyer. We bring value to both buyers and sellers through the dual network effects created by our solution—large volumes of data lead to better matching, which attracts more buyers and sellers, leading to more data. We have one of the largest digital advertising data repositories in the world, which puts us in a unique position to develop differentiated insights to help both buyers and sellers. Our solution is constantly self-improving as we process more volume in the form of bid requests, user visits, events, and transactions, we accumulate more data, which in turn helps make our machine-learning algorithms more intelligent and leads to higher-quality matching between buyers and sellers. Higher quality matching improves return on investment for buyers and revenue for sellers, which in turn attracts more buyers and sellers to our platform. We believe this self-reinforcing dynamic creates a strong platform for growth.

Header Bidding Solution
We offer a "header bidding" solution that integrates technology directly on a publisher website or mobile application to enable us to sit much higher in the publisher’s ad stack. We also integrate with other providers of header bidding solutions. These capabilities allow the strength and scale of our buyer demand to compete for many more seller impressions. 
Independence
Unlike large industry participants, we do not have our own media properties that compete for ad spending with our sellers. Our independence gives our customers an important alternative to monetize and acquire inventory without subsidizing their competitors.
Platform Applications
To enhance the value our technology platform brings to the marketplace, we offer a number of applications to address the critical needs of buyers and sellers.
Applications for Sellers. We have direct relationships and integrations with the sellers on our platform. Our solution includes applications to help them increase their digital advertising revenue, reduce costs, protect their brands and user experience, and reach more buyers efficiently to increase digital advertising revenue by monetizing their full variety and volume of inventory. Our platform offers sellers many capabilities and benefits, including the following:

• | xAPI Technology That Allows Sellers to Easily Access Our Demand. Publishers normally face numerous technical challenges in accessing advertising demand. They either have to modify their web pages by adding cumbersome "ad tags," or they have to integrate monetization code into their mobile applications. Both of these methods create technical risk and are time consuming to implement. xAPI technology eliminates these requirements and makes it easy and fast with no impact to the web pages or apps of the publisher to access demand and fill ad slots.


• | Integrated Solution for Digital Advertising Needs. We provide sellers with a single web-based interface that serves as their central location to manage, analyze, and enhance digital advertising spending from hundreds of different buyers.


• | Inventory Allocation. We offer a solution that helps sellers to increase revenue across advertising types and sales channels by allocating inventory efficiently between direct and indirect demand.


• | Significantly Streamlined Sales, Operations, and Finance Workflow. Our platform streamlines the management of digital advertisement sales by aggregating demand and providing a suite of software applications that automate the process of making inventory available for sale.


• | Security for Brand and User Experience. Our platform is designed to ensure that advertisements shown on a seller website or mobile application conform to the seller’s guidelines, which specify what advertisers, type of product, or type of advertisement may not be shown on the seller’s website or mobile application.


• | Advanced Reporting and Analytics and Actionable Insights. We have developed a robust set of reporting features that sellers can access and use to analyze the vast array of data we collect for them.


• | Consolidated Payments. We provide consolidated billing and collection for sellers who would otherwise be required to dedicate additional resources to cost-effectively manage financial relationships with a large base of buyers.


• | Protective Screening. We protect sellers and users from malware (software that can infect computers with malicious software), check advertisements delivered through our solution for the presence of any malicious or questionable activity or characteristics, screen for unsanctioned advertisements, and reduce recurrence.


• | AdCheq. We review and categorize advertisement creative so that our systems can automatically enforce each seller’s specific advertisement quality policy.


• | Vantage. We provide an extension for Web browsers that lets sellers monitor ads served in context on their sites, providing insight, diagnostic applications, and ad-quality controls.


• | Creative Approval API.Our platform includes a programmatic interface that sellers can use to retrieve a comprehensive set of individual advertising creatives that have bid or served on their sites, and instruct our delivery systems to approve or reject those creatives for future impressions.

Applications for Buyers. Buyers leverage our applications to access a large audience and execute highly automated campaigns that take advantage of unique targeting data and technology as provided by our platform to purchase advertising inventory based on buyers' key demographic, economic, and timing criteria. These applications help streamline 
8

a buyer’s purchasing operations and increase the efficiency of its spending and the effectiveness of its advertising campaigns. Our platform offers buyers many capabilities and benefits, including the following:

• | Direct Access to a Global Audience and Hundreds of Premium Sellers. By leveraging our platform, we believe buyers can reach approximately one billion Internet users globally, including through many of the world's largest and most premium sellers. Furthermore, unlike many organizations in the digital advertising industry, we have direct relationships with sellers and can enable buyers to circumvent a multi-step, expensive, and inefficient process to connect to the seller.


• | Flexible Access to Inventory. Our platform allows buyers to purchase advertising inventory in their preferred manner, whether by RTB or Orders. Our solution also has the flexibility to allow buyers to integrate their purchases on our platform through their existing buying technologies or to buy directly through our platform.


• | Ability to Automate the Direct Purchase of Fully Reserved Inventory Through our Orders Platform. Our direct orders capability enables buyers to significantly streamline the workflow associated with purchasing fully reserved inventory through our Orders platform, while leveraging their first-party data assets.


• | Simplified Order Management and Campaign Tracking. By eliminating most manual steps, our applications enable buyers to efficiently manage their digital campaigns and significantly reduce the time it would otherwise take to effectively execute their digital advertising programs.


• | Transparency and Control Over Advertising Spending. Our platform is designed to let buyers know and control where their dollars are being spent. Buyers can easily navigate through our interface to choose the list of sellers they want to purchase inventory from and see an indicative price range that they should expect to pay.


• | Inventory Quality. We provide systems and processes to detect and minimize questionable inventory, such as non-human traffic. We also ensure that inventory made available for sale is transparently labeled, allowing buyers to make their own decisions about what meets the specific standards of campaigns they are running.


• | PubCheq. We maintain a comprehensive database of all inventory reviewed by internal systems and teams that powers a global blacklist that blocks fraudulent or otherwise problematic seller properties and users from entering the Rubicon Project marketplace and identifies non-human traffic that is fraudulently consuming ad spend.

Growth Strategies
We intend to build upon our current technology and extend our market leadership through innovation and by enhancing our capabilities in the following key growth areas: 

• | Mobile: We believe we can significantly expand the penetration of our mobile offerings among existing buyer and seller customers by creating and introducing new mobile ad formats, extending mobile advertising to brands by providing better signaling and decisioning data, and leveraging header bidding to improve returns for developers.


• | Orders: We believe we can develop technology to enable buyers and sellers to safely leverage their first-party data assets and third-party data assets in our platform to increase the value of the seller’s inventory and precision of the buyer’s targeting efforts, and to drive more precise matching of buyer demand to seller inventory.


• | Header Bidding: We will invest in continued improvement in our header bidding capabilities, including through support of open-source wrapper technologies that eliminate exchange bias, broad integrations to maximize access to inventory supply, and development of enhanced customer service capabilities.


• | xAPI: We have an industry-leading server-to-server technology in exchange API, which we will leverage to improve our inventory position and increase ad request volume on our platform.


• | Video. We plan to expand our video presence by providing turnkey monetization services for over-the-top content providers as they emerge, as well as continuing to video-enable our existing publishers with new formats and stronger measurement and targeting capabilities.


• | Bringing Automation to Additional Media. Historically, our solution has focused on display advertising. We believe, however, that television and other analog and print media will eventually converge with existing digital channels, creating opportunities for us to expand our solution beyond digital media to analog and print media, such as television, radio, and magazines, as well as further expand in out-of-home media like billboards. We intend to extend our solution to track this convergence and support increasingly complex volumes of advertisements spanning multiple media. In addition to platform expansion, we intend to extend beyond our current capabilities for display, video, and engagement to other forms of advertising units as they may arise.

Our Technology
9

To support our solution, we have developed a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet that run our proprietary software, including analytics and decision-making algorithms, and store, manage, and process rules set by buyers and sellers and data about demographics, economics, timing, and preferences. Our hardware provides significant scale and is programmed for high-frequency, low-latency trading. This infrastructure is supported by a real-time data pipeline, a system that quickly moves volumes of data generated by our business into reporting systems that allow usage both internally and by buyers and sellers, and a 24-hour Network Operations Center, which provides failure protection by monitoring and rerouting traffic in the event of equipment failure or network performance issues between buyers and our marketplace.
We estimate that our platform currently averages approximately 13 billion transactions per week. It utilizes over 70,000 central processing units, which read and execute our program instructions. In addition, our platform supports more than 140 gigabytes of data transfer per second and stores more than 20 petabytes of data, backed by our globally distributed infrastructure hosted at data centers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
Our infrastructure is distributed across leased commercial data center locations in the US, Europe, and Asia to reduce latency, and its massive scale supports the volume, diversity, and complexity of buyers’ bids on sellers’ advertising inventory to increase market liquidity and achieves improved pricing using our machine-learning algorithms. Our platform’s architecture allows for additional scale through enhancements and additions to the infrastructure, which enables us to better evolve and adapt to the demands of buyers and sellers and remain competitive in the marketplace.
Our proprietary data-driven machine-learning algorithms enable our solution to make decisions that improve revenue for sellers and return on investment for buyers. These algorithms combine and analyze multiple types of data and enable our systems to execute over 90 million decisions per second, all in time to allow transactions to be executed in milliseconds.
Auction and security algorithms use matchmaking algorithms with both historical and real-time data to drive automated decision-making processes.
Bid efficiency algorithms provide bid prediction (which buyers are most likely to bid on a given impression) and throttling (the volume of bid requests a given buyer can process), to improve infrastructure load and execute transactions in the most timely manner possible by only sending bid requests to those buyers of advertising inventory who can handle the volume and are likely to respond.    
Technology and Development
Innovation is key to our success. In addition to the substantial investments we make in improving and extending our technology, we have developed a research and development center through which we invest in exploratory concepts, particularly focused on reaching consumers and making their advertising experience better. We are developing a consumer application that allows end users to create advertising taste profiles based on their interests, likes and dislikes. If we are successful, our buyer and seller clients will be able to use this data to target more effectively, thereby increasing the value of advertising impressions and improving the consumer experience.
In addition, our core technology and development team is responsible for the design, development, maintenance, and operation of our platform. Our technology and development process emphasizes frequent, iterative, and incremental development cycles. Within the technology and development team, we have several highly aligned, independent sub-teams that focus on particular features of our platform. Each of these sub-teams includes engineers, quality assurance specialists, and product developers responsible for the initial and ongoing development of each sub-team’s feature. In addition, the technology and development team includes our technical operations sub-team, which is responsible for the performance and capacity of our platform. While our sub-teams operate independently, the combined work is coordinated by our project management team, which manages dependencies and optimizes the schedule of the entire team towards common goals.
Technology and development expenses are included in both cost of revenue and technology and development on our consolidated statements of operations. These combined expenses, excluding amounts paid to sellers, were $102.3 million, $79.4 million and $43.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
We believe that continued investment in our platform, including its technologies and functionalities, is critical to our success and long-term growth. We therefore expect technology and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in technology infrastructure to support an increased volume of advertising spending on our platform and international expansion, as well as to expand our engineering and technology teams to maintain and support our technology and development efforts. We also intend to invest in new and enhanced technologies and functionalities to enhance our platform and further automate our business processes with the goal of enhancing our future profitability.
Sales and Marketing
10

We sell our solution to buyers and sellers through our global direct sales team, which operates from various locations around the world. This team leverages its market knowledge and expertise to demonstrate the benefits of advertising automation and our solution to buyers and sellers. We deploy a professional services team with each seller integration to assist sellers in extracting value from our solution. We are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness, and generating new advertising campaigns. To do so, we often present at industry conferences, create custom events, and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team advertises online, in print, and in other forms of media, creates case studies, sponsors research, authors whitepapers, publishes marketing collateral, generates blog posts, and undertakes customer research studies.
Our Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete for buyer spending against many digital media companies, including Google and Facebook. We compete for advertising inventory with supply side platforms, or SSPs, and advertising exchanges, also including Google. As we introduce new offerings, as our existing offerings evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may be subject to additional competition.
We compete for advertising spending and seller inventory made available on our platform. Our offering must remain competitive in terms of scope, ease of use, scalability, speed, price, brand security, customer service, and other technological features that assist buyers in increasing the return on their advertising investment. We compete for digital advertising inventory based on our ability to monetize sellers’ inventory, provide the greatest array of product components covering their various transaction types, and increase fill rates. We compete on the basis of our technology and the competitive strengths described above, including our ability to enable buyers and sellers to purchase and sell a comprehensive range of advertising units (including display and video), utilizing various transaction types (including direct sale of premium inventory on a guaranteed or non-guaranteed basis and real-time bidding), and across digital channels (including mobile web, mobile application, desktop, and out-of-home). While our industry is evolving rapidly and becoming increasingly competitive, we believe that our solution enables us to compete favorably on the factors described above. However, competitive differentiation is difficult to achieve, both in terms of capabilities and in terms of customer perception. We lack the scale of some of our competitors, which may have the ability to compete effectively with us on the basis of their capabilities or ability to offer more aggressive pricing. Other competitors with capabilities inferior to ours may nevertheless compete effectively with us if customers do not perceive, or value, what we believe to be our competitive advantages. With the proliferation of header bidding, pricing has become a key competitive differentiator since the same advertising impression is available through multiple exchanges.
Our Team and Culture
Our team consists of ad tech pioneers and veterans that draw from a broad spectrum of experience, including data science, artificial intelligence, machine-learning algorithms, auctions, infrastructure, and software development.
We focus heavily upon developing and maintaining a company culture that supports our goals. We strive to make our company an exciting place to work, not just a “job.” We reward team and individual excellence and constantly strive to build a stronger, more innovative team and a consistent culture across all our locations.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 572 full-time employees, of whom 426 were in the United States, 218 were in sales and marketing functions, 233 were in technology and development, and 121 were in general and administrative functions. In addition to the United States, we have personnel and operations in England, France, Australia, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and Brazil.
Our Intellectual Property
Our proprietary technologies are important and we rely upon trade secret, trademark, copyright, and patent laws in the United States and abroad to establish and protect our intellectual property and protect our proprietary technologies.
We have seven issued U.S. patents, as described below. Additionally, we have eight pending patent applications in the United States and two pending non-U.S. patent applications. We anticipate that one of the pending U.S. patent applications will go abandoned in 2017. None of these patents has been litigated and we are not licensing any of the patents. Their importance to our business is uncertain and there are no guarantees that any of the patents will serve as protection for our technology or market in the United States or any other country in which an application has been filed. Our seven issued U.S. patents include: U.S. Patent No. 8,472,728, titled System and Method for Identifying and Characterizing Content within Electronic Files Using Example Sets, issued on June 25, 2013; U.S. Patent No. 8,473,346, titled Ad Network Optimization System and Method Thereof, issued on June 25, 2013; U.S. Patent No. 8,554,683, titled Content Security for Real-Time Bidding, issued on October 8, 2013; U.S. Patent No. 8,831,987, titled Managing Bids in a Real-Time Auction for Advertisements, issued on September 9, 2014; U.S. Patent No. 9,076,151, titled Graphical Certifications of Online Advertisements Intended to Impact Click-Through Rates, issued on July 7, 2015; U.S. Patent No. 9,202,248, titled Ad Matching System and Method Thereof, issued on December 1, 2015; and U.S. Patent No. 9,208,507, titled Ad Network Optimization System and Method, issued on December 8, 2015.
11

We register certain domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We also rely upon common law protection for certain trademarks. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. We also use measures designed to control access to our technology and proprietary information. We view our trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets, which we believe differentiate us from our competitors.
Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, or any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property or technology, could harm our business, our ability to compete and our operating results.
Customer Dynamics
While we serve many customers, certain buyers and sellers account for a large share of business transacted through our platform.
On the buy-side of our business, while demand for advertising is diffuse, spending by advertisers on digital advertising has historically been channeled through intermediaries, including principally advertising agencies and DSPs, both of which are important to us. We have generated a majority of our revenue through RTB, and most RTB inventory purchases are executed by a relatively small number of DSPs that have the bidding technologies, data assets, and client bases necessary to enable them to execute RTB purchases at scale on behalf of their clients. We have relationships with almost all of these major DSPs, but because there are relatively few of them, each of these relationships is important to us because it represents a source of demand that would be difficult for us to replace. Similarly, the majority of spending to date on our Orders product has been by a relatively small number of advertising agencies. Creating new agency relationships and expanding our business with existing agency customers is important to our growth, and loss of any agency customers would adversely affect our Orders business. We are working to develop relationships directly with advertisers, both to provide them with direct access to advertising inventory to supplement their DSP and agency relationships, and also to encourage them to influence their DSPs and agencies to route their spending through our platform. 
On the sell-side of our business, while we work with many customers, a relatively small number of them provide a large share of the unique user audiences accessible by buyers. In addition, most of the application providers that make inventory available through our platform utilize SDKs and other proprietary technology of third parties, such as aggregators, and it is those third parties, not the application providers themselves, that contract with us to help monetize the inventory. Termination or diminution of our relationships with these third parties could result in a material reduction of the amount of mobile inventory available through our platform. We encourage application developers to use our own SDK, but it is difficult to displace existing SDKs. 
Our contracts with buyers and sellers generally do not provide for any minimum volumes and may be terminated on relatively short notice. Buyer and seller needs and plans can change quickly, and buyers and sellers are free to terminate their arrangements with us or direct their spending and inventory to competing sources of inventory and demand, quickly and without penalty. Loss of a major buyer would represent direct loss of fees charged to that buyer for its spending, and loss of a major seller representing a unique audience would result in direct loss of fees charged to that seller for sale of that seller’s inventory. In addition, just as growth in the inventory strengthens buyer activity in a network effect, loss of unique inventory or substantial buyers could degrade our marketplace. Loss of major DSP sources of demand could adversely affect bid density or pricing in our RTB auctions, and reduction in seller fees if we are not able to redirect inventory to other demand sources. Loss of important unique inventory could reduce buyer fees from demand that cannot be shifted to other sellers. 
Because of these factors, we seek to expand and diversify our customer relationships. However, the number of large media buyers and sellers in the market is finite, and it could be difficult for us to replace the losses from any buyers or sellers whose relationships with us diminish or terminate. 
Geographic Scope of Our Operations
In addition to the United States, we have personnel and operations in England, France, Australia, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and Brazil. As of December 31, 2016, 146 of our 572 employees were based outside the United States. 
Our international operations and expansion plans expose us to various risks. International operations require significant investment in developing the technology infrastructure necessary to deliver our solution and establishing sales, delivery, support, and administrative capabilities in the countries where we operate. We face staffing challenges, including difficulty in recruiting, retaining, and managing a diverse and distributed workforce across time zones, cultures, and languages. We must also adapt our practices to satisfy local requirements and standards (including differing privacy requirements that are sometimes more stringent than in the U.S.), and manage the effects of global and regional recessions and economic and political instability. Transactions denominated in various non-U.S. currencies expose us to potentially unfavorable changes in exchange rates and added transaction costs. Foreign operations expose us to potentially adverse tax consequences in the United States and abroad and costs and restrictions affecting the repatriation of funds to the United States.

In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately 34%, 31%, and 42%, respectively, of our revenue was generated from international markets. Substantially all of our assets are U.S. assets. For detailed information regarding our revenues and property and equipment, net by geographical region, see Note 17.
User Reach 
It is not practicable to determine the exact number of unique users we reach because we do not collect personally identifiable information. In order to estimate our user reach, we start with data we track on devices we see through our platform in a given time period: for web browsers, we identify each combination of browser user agent and originating IP address, and for mobile application users, we identify unique device identifiers. The resulting aggregated total counts some devices more than once because the same device creates different user agent and IP address combinations by using different browsers to access the internet and/or accessing the internet from locations with different IP addresses. We therefore make assumptions about the amount of duplication, as well as assumptions about the average numbers of devices per person, which can vary by geography and over time, and apply these assumptions to estimate of the number of users we reach. Following this methodology, we estimate that we reach approximately one billion users globally through our platform. This figure depends upon our assumptions and is therefore inherently imprecise and may differ from third-party estimates of our reach.
Regulation
Interest-based advertising, or the use of data to draw inferences about a user’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that user, has come under increasing scrutiny by legislative, regulatory, and self-regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad that focus on consumer protection or data privacy. In particular, this scrutiny has focused on the use of cookies and other technology to collect or aggregate information about Internet users’ online browsing activity. Because we, and our customers, rely upon large volumes of such data collected primarily through cookies, it is essential that we monitor developments in this area domestically and globally, and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect and how we use that data to provide our services.
We provide this notice through our privacy policy, which can be found on our website at http://www.rubiconproject.com/privacy. As stated in our privacy policy, we do not collect information, such as name, address, or phone number, that can be used directly to identify a real person, and we take steps not to collect and store such personally identifiable information from any source. Instead, we rely on non-personally identifiable information about Internet users and do not attempt to associate this data with other data that can be used to identify real people. However, we typically do collect and store IP addresses, geo-location information, and persistent identifiers that are considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of future legislation or regulation. The definition of personally identifiable information, or personal data, varies by country, and continues to evolve in ways that may require us to adapt our practices to avoid violating laws or regulations related to the collection, storage, and use of consumer data. For example, some European countries consider IP addresses or unique device identifiers to be personal data subject to heightened legal and regulatory requirements, whereas the United States does not. As a result, our technology platform and business practices must be assessed regularly in each country in which we do business.
There are also a number of specific laws and regulations governing the collection and use of certain types of consumer data relevant to our business. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, imposes restrictions on the collection and use of data about users of child-directed websites. To comply with COPPA, we have taken various steps to implement a system that: (i) flags seller-identified child-directed sites to buyers, (ii) limits advertisers’ ability to serve interest-based advertisements, (iii) helps limit the types of information that our advertisers have access to when placing advertisements on child-directed sites, and (iv) limits the data that we collect and use on such child-directed sites.

The use and transfer of personal data in EU member states is currently governed under the EU Data Protection Directive, which generally prohibits the transfer of personal data of EU subjects outside of the EU, unless the party exporting the data from the EU implements a compliance mechanism designed to ensure that the receiving party will adequately protect such data. A recent opinion by the Court of Justice of the European Union concluded that the Safe Harbor Framework we previously relied upon is not sufficient to allow transfers of personal data of EU subjects to the United States. Therefore, we must rely on alternative compliance measures, which are complex, which may also be subject to legal challenge, and which, unlike the Safe Harbor Framework, directly subject us to regulatory enforcement by data protection authorities located in the European Union. In addition, the European Union has finalized a General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that will become effective in May 2018. The GDPR sets out higher potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, as well as a greater compliance burden for us in the course of delivering our solution in Europe; among other requirements, the GDPR obligates companies that process large amounts of personal data about EU residents to implement a number of formal processes and policies reviewing and documenting the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. Further, the European Union is currently considering revising the EU Cookie Directive governing the use of technologies to collect consumer information.
Additionally, our compliance with our privacy policy and our general consumer privacy practices are also subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission, which may bring enforcement actions to challenge allegedly unfair and deceptive trade practices, including the violation of privacy policies and representations therein. Certain State Attorneys General may also bring enforcement actions based on comparable state laws or federal laws that permit state-level enforcement. Outside of the United States, our privacy and data practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business.
Beyond laws and regulations, we are also members of self-regulatory bodies that impose additional requirements related to the collection, use, and disclosure of consumer data, including the Internet Advertising Bureau, or IAB, the Digital Advertising Alliance, the Network Advertising Initiative, and the Europe Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. Under the requirements of these self-regulatory bodies, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice via our privacy policy about our use of cookies and other technologies to collect consumer data, and of our collection and use of consumer data to deliver interest-based advertisements. We also allow consumers to opt-out from the use of data we collect for purposes of interest-based advertising through a mechanism on our website, linked through our privacy policy.
Business Seasonality
Our advertising spend, revenue, cash flow from operations, Adjusted EBITDA, operating results, and other key operating and financial measures may vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of buyer spending. For example, many buyers devote a disproportionate amount of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. We expect our revenue, cash flow, operating results and other key operating and financial measures to fluctuate based on seasonal factors from period to period and expect these measures to be higher in the fourth quarters than in prior quarters.
Working Capital Requirements
Our revenue is generated from advertising spend transacted on our platform using our technology solution. Generally, we invoice and collect from buyers the full purchase price for impressions they have purchased, retain our fees (where applicable), and remit the balance to sellers. However, in some cases, we may be required to pay sellers for impressions delivered before we have collected, or even if we are unable to collect, from the buyer of those impressions. There can be no assurances that we will not experience bad debt in the future. Any such write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In addition, we attempt to coordinate collections from our buyers so as to fund our payment obligations to our sellers. However, some buyers and sellers are beginning to require direct billing and collection arrangements between themselves, particularly for our guaranteed orders solution. Further, growth and increased competitive pressure in the digital advertising industry is causing brand spenders to become more demanding, resulting in overall increased focus by all industry participants on pricing, transparency, and cash and collection cycles. Some buyers have experienced financial pressures that have motivated them to challenge some details of our invoices or to slow the timing of their payments to us. If buyers slow their payments to us or our cash collections are significantly diminished as a result of these dynamics, our revenue and/or cash flow could be adversely affected and we may need to use working capital to fund our accounts payable pending collection from the buyers. This may result in additional costs and cause us to forego or defer other more productive uses of that working capital.
