ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
ChampionX Corporation, a Delaware Corporation (“ChampionX,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Company”) is a global leader in chemistry solutions and highly engineered equipment and technologies that help companies drill for and produce oil and gas safely and efficiently around the world. ChampionX’s products provide efficient and safe operations throughout the lifecycle of a well with a focus on the production phase of wells.
On May 9, 2018, we became an independent, publicly traded company as a result of the spin-off (“Separation”) from Dover Corporation (“Dover”) and our common stock began “regular-way” trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the “APY” symbol.
On June 3, 2020, the Company and Ecolab Inc. (“Ecolab”) completed a Reverse Morris Trust transaction in which Ecolab transferred their upstream energy business to ChampionX Holding Inc. (“legacy ChampionX”) and, thereafter, distributed all of the shares of legacy ChampionX common stock to certain Ecolab stockholders (“the Distribution”). Immediately following the Distribution, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into legacy ChampionX, with legacy ChampionX continuing as the surviving company in the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“the Merger”). In association with the completion of the Merger, the Company changed its name from Apergy Corporation to ChampionX Corporation and its ticker symbol to “CHX”. See Note 3—Merger Transaction, Acquisitions, And Dispositions in Part II, Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
At the opening of trading on January 4, 2021, the Company transferred its listing from NYSE to The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.
In connection with the Merger, we re-evaluated our reportable segments. As a result, we identified two new reportable segments, Production Chemical Technologies and Reservoir Chemical Technologies, which include the results of operations of legacy ChampionX. The legacy Apergy reportable segments remain unchanged. The results of operations of legacy ChampionX are reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the Merger through December 31, 2020. Results for the periods prior to June 3, 2020 reflect the financial and operating results of legacy Apergy and do not include the financial and operating results of legacy ChampionX. As such, our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods.

The products and services within Production Chemical Technologies are sold and supported by our on-site experts and customer account leaders, as well as through distributors, sales agents, and joint ventures. More than half of our employees work directly with customers to provide expertise and support at their production sites or remotely. We support our customers directly by leveraging a global laboratory network and a team of more than 400 scientists, engineers, and technologists. Production Chemical Technologies has an extensive portfolio of intellectual property and provides differentiated solutions as a central theme of our commercial offering.
We help enable our customers to achieve their sustainability goals through maximizing production, minimizing environmental footprint, reducing emissions, and lowering fresh-water usage.
Production & Automation Technologies
Production & Automation Technologies offers products, technologies, and services that facilitate the safe, efficient, and cost-effective extraction of oil and gas through artificial lift and digital automation applications. We design, manufacture, market, and service a full range of artificial lift equipment, end-to-end automation and digital solutions, as well as other production equipment. Artificial lift equipment is critical to oil and gas operators for increasing pressure within the reservoir and improving oil and gas production. Our product offerings include electrical submersible pumping systems (“ESP”), gas lift systems, jet pumps, and multiplex surface pumps supporting hydraulic lift, plunger lift equipment, progressive cavity pumping (“PCP”) systems, and downhole rod lift systems.
Artificial lift is a key technology for increasing oil and gas production throughout the lifecycle of a producing well and is therefore directly linked to operator economics. Our comprehensive offering provides customers with cost effective solutions tailored to a well’s specific characteristics and production volumes. With sales, operations, and distribution networks around the globe, we offer all types of downhole equipment and industry-leading automation and optimization hardware and software to customers operating within the major oil and gas basins throughout the world.
Our proprietary digital products are aimed at creating an end-to-end production-optimization platform that enables oil and gas operators to monitor, predict, and optimize well performance and drive a higher return on investment during the production lifecycle. We are a leading provider of productivity tools and performance management software for artificial lift and asset integrity management. We provide advanced controls technology that allows operators to adjust the operation of downhole artificial lift systems to production rates either at the wellsite or remotely. Our optimization software has modular architecture that enables specific solutions to be tailored to meet exact customer needs. Real-time data is used by our customers to drive decisions, enhance well servicing and obtain an accurate picture of a well’s performance over time, resulting in a more connected, digital wellsite that operates more efficiently and safely. For operators that require support, we provide optimization teams that monitor customer wells and make timely adjustments to equipment operation to extend the life of the artificial lift system and mitigate production down time. In the current oil and gas industry, particularly in the current down cycle, operators are focused on lowering their total operating costs over the life of a well. We believe our combination of digital products and strong artificial lift presence enables us to drive continued adoption of digital solutions by our customers and will improve our long-term revenues. 
We also offer other production equipment including chemical injection systems, flow control valves, and gauges. These products are complementary to our artificial lift and digital technologies offerings. A portion of Production & Automation Technologies revenue is derived from activity-based consumable products, as customers routinely replace items such as sucker rods, plunger lift, and pump parts. 
Drilling Technologies
Drilling Technologies offers innovative, top-quality polycrystalline diamond cutter (“PDC”) inserts, bearings, valves, and mining tools to help customers drill the world’s most demanding oil exploration and development projects, and for use in other industries. These highly specialized products are developed and produced based on more than 40 years of innovation and intellectual property development in material science applications. We press our own synthetic diamonds, known as polycrystalline diamonds, that meet the highest standards and match the requirements of the most demanding engineering projects. Our highly trained team members work with customers to develop custom-designed PDC inserts and bearings through a consultative process, ensuring that we tailor the products to generate the best outcomes for their operations.
We believe our highly engineered PDCs are distinguished by their quality, durability, rate of penetration, and longevity. PDCs are a relatively small cost to the oil and gas operator in the context of overall drilling costs, but are critical to cost-effective and efficient drilling. Our PDCs are primarily custom designed to meet unique customer requirements and are finished to exact customer specification to ensure optimal performance. PDCs are utilized in both vertical and horizontal drilling and are replaced as they wear during the drilling process.
We manufacture long-lasting diamond bearings for down-hole drilling motors, pumps, and turbines running in the most challenging environments. These diamond bearings are also used by customers in renewable energy applications, mixers, and agitators. These bearings have a high thermal conductivity to reduce localized temperature extremes that lead to bearing degradation, and they are very resistant to wear from abrasive particles in lubricants or process fluids. These process-fluid lubricated applications include underwater applications, downhole drilling tools, and industrial pumps.
We also manufacture high-density ceramic roof bolt mining tools focused on improving the production and safety of underground mining operations. The technically advanced and unique diamond technology of these products makes these tools incredibly long lasting for their respective applications.
Reservoir Chemical Technologies
Reservoir Chemical Technologies offers chemistry-oriented solutions and technologies to help customers meet their performance, efficiency, sustainability, and financial objectives for well drilling, cementing, fracturing, acidizing, and other well interventions. For example, we design high performance integrated fracturing fluid systems to improve the customer’s operational efficiency, lower chemical program costs and enhance well productivity. We assist our customers in achieving their sustainability goals relating to fresh-water usage by increasing their ability to use recycled water, while mitigating the impact of fluid problems that can shorten the life of the well (e.g., scale, emulsion, and microbial growth).
We offer a range of fluid solutions that help our customers achieve more successful and efficient drilling and cementing operations and enhance well productivity. We also leverage our deep experience in water treatment and processing to offer our customers products that help to control scale and inhibit microbial growth and corrosion. Our expertise involves designing tailored products that help our customers create optimized fluid packages based on individual well dynamics. The largest product lines in Reservoir Chemical Technologies include fracturing fluid packages, drilling additives, cement additives and products that support acidizing activities.
See Note 5—Revenue in Part II, Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for revenue by geography for each of our reportable segments.

We also host forums and training sessions, such as our Artificial Lift Academy, where our customers can share their experiences, learn best practices and accelerate the application of our technologies. 
Our customer base is diverse. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2020 consolidated revenue. 
Intellectual Property
We own a large portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property, which we acquired over many years and, to the extent applicable, expire at various times. A large portion of our intellectual property consists of patents, unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees, customers, and suppliers where appropriate. We occasionally license third-party intellectual property to supplement our product and service offerings. We also have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents and registering trademarks around the world and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement. While our intellectual property is important to our success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights, or any group of related rights, is not likely to materially affect our results of operations on a consolidated basis. We believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements, new product development and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as sales, marketing and service expertise, are significant to our leadership positions in the markets we serve.
Research and Development
We operate in markets that are characterized by changing technology and frequent new product introductions. As a result, our success is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new technologies and products for our customers. Technology has become increasingly critical in our industry as global oil and natural gas reservoirs mature, depletion of production accelerates, customers utilize increasingly complex well designs, the industry witnesses an aging oil and gas industry workforce, while customers continue to stress higher operational efficiency from existing infrastructure and systems. Despite fluctuations in the number of wells drilled, Exploration & Production (E&P) companies have consistently increased their expenditures on technology to improve oil and natural gas recovery and lower their costs. We have invested substantially in building our research, development, and engineering capabilities and digital and other technology offerings, all of which we believe help our customers minimize risk, achieve production targets, extend field life and maximize profitability in a safe and responsible manner.
Our research and development program focuses on the following activities:
•Developing next-generation technology for all aspects of oil and natural gas production, including both conventional and unconventional, and across the entire life cycle of a producing asset.
•Accelerating digitally-enabled solutions to automate workflows and eliminate waste in business processes.
•Enhancing our ability to predict, identify and solve our customers’ operational challenges with our portfolio of products and services.
•Increasing product reliability and decreasing the cost of the products and services that we bring to market by using innovation to drive operational efficiency.
•Expanding revenue opportunities domestically and internationally.
•Maintaining or extending competitive advantages.
Our key research and development disciplines include analytical and material science, chemical synthesis, formulation science, microbiology, reservoir engineering, software engineering, process and equipment. We also have a robust external innovation program that leverages the capabilities and knowledge of key suppliers and joint development programs with start-up companies. Furthermore, we have a number of technical specialists embedded in key geographies to provide an efficient channel to deploy our new technologies in the major oil and natural gas basins around the world. We believe maintaining a robust innovation and product pipeline will allow us to continue to increase our market share in key businesses and with key customers.
Raw Materials
We use a wide variety of raw materials in manufacturing our products, including inorganic chemicals such as alkalis, acids, biocides, phosphonates, phosphorous materials, silicates and salts. We also use organic chemicals, such as acids, alcohols, amines, fatty acids, surfactants, solvents, monomers, polymers, metals, and semi-processed or finished components. We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized dispensing equipment and systems. We have not historically experienced material impacts to our financial results due to shortages or the loss of any single supplier. Although the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing for metals, such as nickel, chrome, molybdenum, vanadium, manganese, and steel scrap fluctuate with market conditions. Recently, tariffs have increased our material input costs, and further trade restrictions, retaliatory trade measures, or additional tariffs implemented could result in higher input costs to our products. Although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. We attempt to control such costs through short-duration, fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain initiatives. We source material internationally to achieve the most competitive cost structure. Our global supply chain is intended to provide us with cost-effective solutions for raw materials, however, our supply chain could be exposed to logistical disruptions. We maintain domestic suppliers in most cases to provide for contingencies and back-up sources. Despite contingencies and back-up supply optionality, sustained inflation and unpredictable disruptions to supply could have an adverse impact on our business.
Human Capital
We are a purpose-driven company with a distinctive strategic vision that is focused on improving the lives of our customers, our employees, our shareholders, and the communities where we live and work. We bring more than a century of expertise and the unique skills, perspectives, and experiences of our global team members enable us to realize opportunities for growth, drive unmatched excellence, and contribute exponentially to our success.
Health & Safety; COVID-19 
The safety of our employees, customers, shareholders, and communities is vitally important. From the way we operate, to the products we develop, to how we partner with customers, our goal is zero: zero accidents, zero incidents, and zero environmental releases. ChampionX’s Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) policy is to conduct business in a manner that protects people, assets, and the environment. All employees are committed to embody our safety culture through personal leadership, engagement, and empowerment. Our organization provides training and a culture of support for our employees to ensure they are equipped and prepared to do their jobs safely every day.
Our businesses are classified as critical infrastructure and it is important to us to protect the health and safety of our employees as we continue to support vital oil and gas infrastructure around the world. We responded to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic with a comprehensive plan including enacting social distancing policies, equipping employees with additional personal protective equipment, and following government and health authority recommended protocols, including those of the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. Employee surveys demonstrated positive feedback regarding our implementation of protocols, proactive communications and maintaining the safety and health of our employees. Our comprehensive plan included additional paid leave for our employees who needed to recover from the virus or provide care 
to family members, adjusting the healthcare plan for employees and dependents for any COVID-19 related testing or healthcare expenditures, and implementing flexible-work programs to accommodate personal and family needs, especially as schools transitioned to remote learning, while maintaining business continuity. For additional information, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.”
Merger Integration – Better Together 
The Merger brought significant scale and depth to our leadership capabilities and talent bench. Our Driven to Improve principle is about eliminating waste, finding efficiencies, and getting better every day. To help us improve, employee feedback is important. We proactively engage with employees through surveys, including inquiries designed towards helping us measure our progress with integration efforts and maintaining our people-oriented, purpose-driven culture, which received positive results. We also created a “Pipeline to the CEO” for employees to give feedback and ask questions, which they may do anonymously if they choose. Our Chief Executive Officer is committed to reading and responding to every message submitted and these are made available to all employees through our internal intranet.
Employee Footprint
In the Merger, we grew our employee population and global footprint. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 6,600 employees in 38 countries, with 66% in North America, approximately 10% in each of Latin America and Middle East/Africa, 9% in Europe and approximately 5% in Asia Pacific. Hiring and retaining top talent is important to our success and we believe our purpose-driven culture differentiates us as an employer of choice.
Diversity & Inclusion
ChampionX is committed to building and fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace where all employees feel a sense of belonging and alignment to our organization’s culture and purpose. We recognize the value of diversity and inclusion in increasing performance and cultivating strong teams. ChampionX currently supports several Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”) that are voluntary employee-led and leadership-supported groups representing unique cultures, experiences, backgrounds and ethnicities. ERGs allow for more purposeful alignment with our business strategy, enhance recruitment efforts and our talent pipeline, support professional development and improve retention, provide skill building and training and mentorship and guidance, and enhance engagement levels across the organization as well as with the communities in which our employees live and work. We are proud that nearly 700 employees are involved in our ERGs and participate in elevating our goal of creating a workplace culture where everyone feels a sense of belonging.
Training & Development
We invest in engaging and developing employees to enable us to realize opportunities for growth and contribute to advancing progress on our strategic priorities. Our ongoing efforts and initiatives are aimed at attracting, engaging, and developing employees in a thoughtful and meaningful way to support a diverse and inclusive culture. Training programs are deployed across the organization in technical skills, product expertise, and health and safety measures, as well as in soft skill development such as communication and other interpersonal skills. All employees participate in annual ethics and compliance training at least once a year and we sponsor advanced training in manager essentials and leadership development. We recognize employee performance through incentives tied to our financial goals and strategic objectives, together with employee’s individual achievement.
Regulatory Requirements and Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to a variety of international, national, state, and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the safety of the sale and distribution of chemical substances, the manufacture and use of certain substances, discharge of materials into the environment, costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials, waste disposal and plant site cleanup, worker health and safety, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take what we believe are appropriate measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, environmental risks are inherent in our businesses. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance.
In addition, we depend on the demand for our products and services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, are affected by changing taxes, price controls, tariffs and trade restrictions, and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, including those specifically directed to hydraulic fracturing, onshore production, and air pollution. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration, drilling, or production in the oil and gas industry, or the imposition of more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and 
services or restricting our customers’ operations. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information related to certain risks regarding regulations and environmental matters.
We utilize behavioral-based safety practices to promote a safe working environment for all of our employees. Safety is prioritized, measured and promoted throughout all levels of our organization. We continued our “Journey to Zero” program which teaches that all incidents are preventable. The core tenets of our program advocate (i) constant awareness and education of safety principles, (ii) consistent safety behaviors and practices, and (iii) preventing and learning from incidents. Additionally, our operations are subject to a number of federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (“PRP”), we are currently involved with site clean-up activities pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”, also known as “Superfund”) or state equivalents at 11 locations, the majority of which are in the U.S. Based on our experience with such environmental proceedings, and an analysis of the estimated share of investigation and remediation costs payable by the PRPs, we have accrued our best estimate of probable future costs relating to these sites. In establishing accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included in accruals and the accruals are not discounted. We are unable to predict when, or if, the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes.
We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Historically, there were no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with such laws or regulations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operational costs.
