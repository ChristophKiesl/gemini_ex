Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in 2019 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our “initial business combination”.
 
Our sponsor is an affiliate of Starboard, a registered investment adviser with investment experience and a track record of value creation in portfolio companies operating in the public markets. Starboard has assembled a seasoned team of executives (the “Industry Advisors”), whom we believe will help us execute our differentiated investment strategy. Through our affiliation with our sponsor and Industry Advisors, we seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic, or managerial transformation to maximize value for stockholders. We focus on private companies which we believe offer an opportunity for stockholder value creation through the combination of (i) an attractive valuation entry point, (ii) a clear plan to unlock incremental value through operational and/or strategic improvements, and (iii) a clear path to bring the target company to the public market and implement best-in-class public company governance. We seek to partner with the owners of private companies to offer them an option to create partial liquidity, transition their legacy to a public company and/or resolve any fragmented ownership or succession planning issues, all while maintaining a singular focus on driving the target business to a higher level of performance and value.
 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we focus on industries that align with the background of our sponsor and Industry Advisors. These industries include the technology, healthcare, consumer, industrials and hospitality & entertainment sectors, which we refer to as our targeted sectors. We believe that there are many potential business combination targets within these industries that could become attractive public companies. Furthermore, we believe that we are well-positioned to drive ongoing value creation post-business combination, based on the operational and investment experience and track record of our team within our targeted sectors over time. We believe our team is well-suited to identify and execute on opportunities that have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. We are not, however, required to complete our initial business combination within our targeted sectors, and, as a result, we may pursue a business combination outside of these industries.

Company History
 
On September 14, 2020, we consummated our IPO of 36,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $360.0 million. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-sixth of one redeemable warrant (each, a “detachable redeemable warrant”) and a contingent right to receive at least one-sixth of one redeemable warrant following the time at which we redeem the shares of Class A common stock that the holders thereof have elected to redeem in connection with the initial business combination (the “initial business combination redemption time”) under certain circumstances and subject to adjustments (the “distributable redeemable warrants”). Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, at the distribution time (as defined below), we will effect a distribution of a number of warrants equal to the number of units issued in the IPO multiplied by one-sixth (the “Aggregate Warrant Amount”) as follows: (i) to the extent that no holders of public shares (the “public stockholders”) redeem their shares of Class A common stock issued in the IPO (whether acquired in the IPO or afterwards) (the “public shares”) in connection with the initial business combination, each public stockholder will receive one-sixth of one distributable redeemable warrant per public share and (ii) to the extent that any public stockholders redeem any of their public shares in connection with the initial business combination, then (A) one-sixth of one distributable redeemable warrant will be distributed per each public share that was not redeemed (the “remaining public shares”) and (B) the warrants in an amount equal to the Aggregate Warrant Amount less the number of warrants distributed pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) will be distributed on a pro rata basis to (x) the holders of the remaining public shares based on their percentage of Class A common stock held after redemptions and the issuance of any forward purchase shares (as defined below), as distributable redeemable warrants and (y) the holders of the forward purchase shares based on their percentage of Class A common stock held after redemptions and the issuance of any forward purchase shares, as private placement warrants. Public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights are not entitled to receive any distribution of distributable redeemable warrants in respect of such redeemed public shares. The number of distributable redeemable warrants to be distributed in respect of each public share is contingent upon the aggregate number of public shares that are redeemed in connection with our initial business combination. The “distribution time” references the time at which the distributable redeemable warrants and the private placement warrants, if any, to the forward purchasers (as defined below) will be distributed, which will occur immediately after the initial business combination redemption time and immediately prior to the closing of our initial business combination.
 
On September 18, 2020, the underwriters in the IPO partially exercised their over-allotment option and on September 23, 2020, purchased an additional 4,423,453 units (the “over-allotment units”), generating gross proceeds of approximately $44.2 million.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 6,133,333 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) to our sponsor, at a purchase price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to us of $9.2 million. In connection with the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option, our sponsor purchased an additional 589,794 private placement warrants, at a purchase price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to us of approximately $0.9 million.
 
Upon the closing of the IPO, the sale of the private placement warrants, the sale of the over-allotment units and 589,794 additional private placement warrants, $404.2 million ($10.00 per unit) of the net proceeds of such sales were placed in a trust account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “trust account”), and invested only in U.S. “government securities,” within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an initial business combination and (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A common stock the right to have their shares redeemed or to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, or with respect to any other material provision relating to stockholder rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law.
 
On September 9, 2020, certain clients of Starboard, which are also the majority-owners of our sponsor, entered into an amended and restated forward purchase agreement (the “forward purchase agreement”) with us pursuant to which such clients (the “forward purchasers”) will purchase shares of our Class A common stock (“forward purchase shares”) at a price equal to $9.50 per share, in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination. At the closing, the forward purchasers will purchase the number of forward purchase shares from us that would result in net proceeds in an aggregate amount necessary to satisfy our aggregate payment obligations resulting from the exercise of redemption rights by holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination (the “Redemption Obligation”), subject to a maximum funding commitment by the forward purchasers of $100,000,000 (the “Maximum Backstop Commitment”). In addition, in connection with their purchase of any forward purchase shares, the forward purchasers will acquire private placement warrants at the distribution time as further described above.

In November 2019, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,625,000 shares of our Class B common stock (our “founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. In June 2020, our sponsor transferred (i) 431,250 founder shares to Martin D. McNulty, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors, and (ii) 25,000 founder shares to each of Pauline J. Brown, Michelle Felman and Lowell Robinson. In July 2020, our sponsor transferred 25,000 founder shares to Robert L. Greene. On September 9, 2020, we effected a stock dividend of 1,725,000 shares with respect to our Class B common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 10,350,000 founder shares. An aggregate of 244,137 of such founder shares held by our sponsor and our Chief Executive Officer were forfeited upon the underwriters’ partial exercise of the over-allotment option on September 18, 2020. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (collectively, the “common stock”) upon the completion of our IPO. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination.
 
Proposed Business Combination
 
On February 21, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Mundo Merger Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of SVAC (“Merger Sub 1”), Mundo Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of SVAC (“Merger Sub 2”), Cyxtera Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Cyxtera”), and Mundo Holdings, Inc. (“NewCo”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of SIS Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Cyxtera Stockholder”), which provides for, among other things, (i) Cyxtera to be contributed to Newco by the Cyxtera Stockholder, with Cyxtera becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newco, (ii) Merger Sub 1 to be merged with and into NewCo (the “First Merger”), with NewCo surviving the First Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SVAC and Merger Sub 1 ceasing to exist, and (iii) immediately following the First Merger, NewCo to be merged with and into Merger Sub 2 (the “Second Merger”, and together with the First Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Cyxtera Business Combination”), with Merger Sub 2 surviving the Second Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SVAC and NewCo ceasing to exist.
 
As a result of the Cyxtera Business Combination, Cyxtera and the various operating subsidiaries of Cyxtera will become subsidiaries of SVAC, with the Cyxtera Stockholder becoming a stockholder of SVAC. Upon closing of the Cyxtera Business Combination, we will be renamed “Cyxtera Technologies, Inc.”
 
As a consequence of the Cyxtera Business Combination, each issued and outstanding founder share will automatically convert into a share of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. The Cyxtera Business Combination is expected to close mid-2021, following the receipt of the required approval by our stockholders and the fulfillment of other customary closing conditions.
 
In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Cyxtera Stockholder entered into a Stockholder Support Agreement with SVAC and Cyxtera (the “Stockholder Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Cyxtera Stockholder agreed to (i) provide its consent to the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the mergers and the pre-closing restructuring, and (ii) take all actions necessary or appropriate to contribute its equity securities in Cyxtera to NewCo and otherwise cause the pre-closing restructuring to occur in accordance with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Cyxtera Stockholder agreed not to transfer any equity securities of Cyxtera or NewCo until the date upon which the Stockholder Support Agreement expires, except as contemplated by the Stockholder Support Agreement. Further, our sponsor and the other holders of our founder shares (together with the sponsor, the “Insiders”) entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement with SVAC and Cyxtera (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, each Insider agreed to (i) vote all Class A common stock and Class B common stock owned by it, him or her (all such common stock, the “Covered Shares”) in favor of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the mergers, and each other proposal related thereto included on the agenda for the special meeting of stockholders related thereto and (ii) not redeem, or seek to redeem, any Covered Shares owned by it, him or her in connection with the stockholder approval of the Cyxtera Business Combination. In addition, each Insider agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer, as applicable, any shares of Class B common stock, private placement warrants (or shares of Class A common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of private placement warrants) or other equity securities of SVAC until the date upon which the Sponsor Support Agreement expires. Solely in connection with and only for the purpose of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, each Insider irrevocably and unconditionally waived and agreed not to assert, claim or perfect any rights to adjustment or other anti-dilution protection with respect to the rate that the shares of Class B common stock held by him, her or it converts into Class A common stock pursuant to Section 4.3 of our amended and restated certicfiate of incorporation or any other anti-dilution protections or other adjustment or similar protections that arise in connection with the Cyxtera Business Combination.

In addition, Cyxtera and the forward purchasers entered into a letter agreement related to the optional share purchase agreement (as defined below), pursuant to which letter agreement the forward purchasers agreed not to purchase optional shares (as defined below) in an aggregate amount exceeding $75,000,000 for all forward purchasers.
 
In connection with the Merger Agreement, we entered into separate subscription agreements, dated February 21, 2021, with certain investors, pursuant to which we have agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Cyxtera Business Combination, an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Class A common stock for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $250,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), of which certain clients of Starboard have committed to purchase, on the same terms as the other subscribers, an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $60,000,000.
 
The Merger Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us on February 22, 2021. For additional information regarding Cyxtera, the Merger Agreement and the Cyxtera Business Combination, see the proxy statement to be filed by us.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this Annual Report does not assume the closing of the Cyxtera Business Combination.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that can benefit from the strategic and transactional experience of Starboard, our management and our Industry Advisors to catalyze and transform the company and create stockholder value. We believe our sponsor, management team, Industry Advisors, and independent directors have access to a wide range of opportunities due to their extensive network of relationships with management teams of public and private companies, private equity sponsors, other public investors, investment bankers, lenders, restructuring advisers, attorneys, accountants, and other consultants and intermediaries. We have chosen Industry Advisors with specific experience in a broad range of industry sectors, including technology, healthcare, consumer, industrials and the hospitality & entertainment sectors because we believe that examining acquisition opportunities across all of these sectors increases the likelihood of finding an acquisition target that will lead to stockholder value creation.
 
Over the last 18 years, Starboard’s investment team has developed extensive experience working with management teams of public companies, across market capitalizations and industries, in order to unlock stockholder value. Over the past 18 years, Starboard’s team has been actively involved with more than 120 public companies and has developed an extensive network of operators and advisors with whom it works. Starboard has built a strong reputation and following in the public markets, attracting significant fundamental investor interest in the companies in which it invests. Starboard typically focuses on investment opportunities in public companies in need of transformation and looks to work with those companies to effect such transformations through operational improvements, changes in strategic focus, improved execution, enhanced corporate governance and oversight, and/or by providing strategic capital. We believe this track record of public company value creation and Starboard’s practices in partnering with companies and their stockholders to effect change are relevant capabilities for private companies seeking a public listing, and present a compelling value proposition for such potential target businesses. Our management team and Starboard have experience in:
 

• | Sourcing, structuring, acquiring, integrating and selling businesses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fostering relationships with sellers, capital providers and target leadership teams;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Negotiating transactions favorable to investors; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------

• | Accessing the capital markets, including financing businesses and helping companies transition to public ownership.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, our Industry Advisors have been successful chief executive officers, senior executives, and board members of public and private companies, and we believe they will enhance our value proposition to potential business combination partners given their collective expertise, operational and strategic capabilities, and track record in their respective sectors. Our Industry Advisors have experience in:
 

• | Operating companies, setting and changing strategies and capital allocation, and identifying, monitoring and recruiting world-class talent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquiring and integrating companies;
--+-------------------------------------


• | Embarking on corporate turnarounds and implementing transformational long-term strategies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing and growing companies, both organically and through acquisitions and strategic transactions and expanding the product range and geographic footprint of businesses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our management team’s and Industry Advisors’ track record of identifying and sourcing transactions positions us well to appropriately evaluate potential business combinations and select one that will be well received by the public markets. Additionally, we believe that Starboard’s extensive experience investing in and serving on the boards of companies that are undergoing strategic and/or operational transformations further increases the chances of successfully identifying a quality business where we can employ our practices to improve performance and valuation while it undergoes strategic and/or operational changes. Our sourcing process leverages the extensive networks of our Industry Advisors. We deploy a proactive sourcing strategy and focus on companies where we believe the combination of our management team’s and Industry Advisors’ operating experience, relationships, capital and capital markets expertise can be catalysts to transform a target company and create value for our stockholders. Since the completion of our IPO, members of our management team, Starboard and the Industry Advisors have actively been searching for a target business by communicating with their network of relationships and other interested parties.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
We believe we have the opportunity to pursue a differentiated set of potential acquisition targets due to our management team’s, Starboard’s and the Industry Advisors’ experience in driving transformative change in businesses in order to create value for stockholders. Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses and set us apart from other sources of capital pursuing target businesses in our areas of focus. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We seek to acquire companies that we believe:

• | Are prepared to be public companies and will benefit from having a public currency in order to enhance their ability to pursue accretive acquisitions, high-return capital projects, and/or strengthen their balance sheet.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Are good businesses that are underperforming their potential in industries that are otherwise exhibiting stable or improving fundamentals. We evaluate each industry and the target businesses within those industries based on several factors, including the potential for sustainable competitive advantages, the ability to drive meaningful operational improvements, the ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, and the sustainability of cash flow. We seek targets that will be compatible with our rigorous value creation process, whereby we identify several value enhancing initiatives prior to making the acquisition and define processes to implement and optimize those initiatives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have a defensible market position with demonstrated advantages compared to competitors that create barriers to entry against new potential market entrants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate by developing new products or services, or are situations in which we believe we can drive improved financial performance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have significant embedded and/or underexploited expansion opportunities. This can be accomplished through a combination of accelerating organic growth and finding attractive bolt-on acquisition targets. Our management team and Industry Advisors have significant experience in identifying such targets and helping target management assess the strategic and financial fit of potential bolt-on acquisitions. Similarly, we believe our management team and Industry Advisors have the expertise to assess the likely synergies between target companies and help a target effectively integrate acquisitions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe represent upside in the public markets based on our company-specific analysis and due diligence review. For a potential target company, this process includes, among other things, a review and analysis of the company’s capital structure, quality of earnings, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, materials contracts, and industry background and trends.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have strong, experienced management teams, or provide a platform to assemble an effective management team with a track record of driving growth, profitability, and value creation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our stockholders. We seek to acquire a target on terms and in a manner that leverages our experience in transformational investing. Financial returns are evaluated based on (i) the potential for organic growth in cash flows, (ii) the ability to achieve cost savings, (iii) the ability to accelerate growth, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions, and (iv) the prospects for creating value through other value creation initiatives. Potential upside from growth in the target business’ earnings and an improved capital structure is weighed against any identified downside risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 
In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds, and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
 
Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, as applicable and among other things, commercial and industry due diligence, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. To help facilitate this evaluation, we rely on input from our management team, Industry Advisors and third-party due diligence providers. We also leverage the operational and capital allocation planning experience of Starboard, our management team, and our Industry Advisors.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors, or our officers or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, our directors, officers or their affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or officers, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.

In addition, we believe our ability to complete our initial business combination will be enhanced by the forward purchase agreement pursuant to which the forward purchasers will purchase forward purchase shares for an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000 in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination. These purchases are intended to satisfy the Redemption Obligation and thereby provide us with a minimum funding level for our initial business combination.
 
Further, our distributable redeemable warrants provide our public stockholders with an incentive not to redeem their shares of Class A common stock in connection with our initial business combination. Holders who choose to redeem their shares will lose the right to receive any distributable redeemable warrants. Public stockholders who choose not to redeem their shares of Class A common stock will share in the distribution of 6,737,242 warrants with other non-redeeming holders, and, to the extent public stockholders exercise their right to redeem their Class A common stock in connection with the initial business combination, with the holders of the forward purchase shares (as described in this Annual Report), and will receive a portion of the additional warrants that were effectively surrendered by redeeming holders. As a result, public stockholders who do not redeem their shares will receive at least one-sixth of a distributable redeemable warrant per share they hold, and a greater amount if other holders elect to redeem. We believe this structure will likely lead to a lower level of redemptions.
 
Certain of our directors and officers own founder shares and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such directors and officers may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such directors and officers was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for one or more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us. However, we do not expect these duties to present a significant conflict of interest with our search for an initial business combination. We believe this conflict of interest with respect to our officers and directors affiliated with Starboard is mitigated, to a certain extent, by the differing nature of the investments Starboard typically considers most attractive for its clients and the types of acquisitions we expect Starboard Value Acquisition Corp. to find most attractive.
 
No members of our management team have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware, unless presented to such member specifically in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the company and after they have satisfied their contractual and fiduciary obligations to other parties. Any knowledge or presentation of such opportunities may therefore present conflicts of interest.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
 
In addition, none of our Industry Advisors are officers or directors of our company and therefore owe us no fiduciary duties as such. While we expect that they will continue to assist us in identifying business combination targets, they have no obligation to do so and may devote a substantial portion of their business time to activities unrelated to us. Our Industry Advisors may have fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to other organizations to present business combination opportunities to such other organizations rather than to us. Accordingly, if any Industry Advisor becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for one or more entities to which he has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he or she will honor those obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he determines to present the opportunity to us.

Initial Business Combination
 
As required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), our initial business combination will be approved by a majority of our independent directors. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discount and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our securities are no longer listed on Nasdaq, we will not be obligated to satisfy such 80% test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business for the post-acquisition company to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for the purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.

Corporate Information
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following September 14, 2025, the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for a business combination in the amount of $386,212,762 as of December 31, 2020, assuming no redemptions and after payment of $18,190,554 of deferred underwriting fees, but before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, and the funds, if any, from the issuance of our forward purchase shares and optional shares, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to complete our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants to the sponsor and the forward purchase shares, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction business, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working capital.
 
12

 

In addition to the forward purchase shares, we may seek to raise additional funds in connection with the completion of our initial business combination through a private offering of equity securities or debt securities or loans, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offerings or loans rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
As required by Nasdaq rules, our initial business combination will be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Nasdaq rules also require that an initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discount and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account). The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test. There is no basis for investors in our securities to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
 
Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.

Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors or Industry Advisors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders may not have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
 

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 
Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

• | we issue shares of common stock that will either be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14

 


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance or potential issuance will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
 

• | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Permitted Purchases of our Securities
 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, Industry Advisors or any of their respective affiliates may purchase public shares or redeemable warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares or warrants such persons may purchase. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the event our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a stockholder vote relating to our initial business combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to (1) refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (2) clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
 
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
15

 

The purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of our initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or any of their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates will purchase shares only if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their respective affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their respective affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of common stock if such purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of amounts withdrawn to pay our taxes (“permitted withdrawals”)), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the initial business combination, we will be required to purchase any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the trust account as of December 31, 2020 is $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. However, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per public share initially held in the trust account due to claims of creditors (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risks Relating to our Securities — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors herein). The redemption right will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.

Distribution of Redeemable Warrants to Holders of Class A Common Stock not Electing Redemption
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, at the distribution time, we will effect a distribution of a number of warrants equal to the Aggregate Warrant Amount as follows: (i) to the extent that no public stockholders redeem their public shares in connection with the initial business combination, each public stockholder will receive one-sixth of one distributable redeemable warrant per public share and (ii) to the extent that any public stockholders redeem any of their public shares in connection with the initial business combination, then (A) one-sixth of one distributable redeemable warrant will be distributed per each remaining public share and (B) the warrants in an amount equal to the Aggregate Warrant Amount less the number of warrants distributed pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) will be distributed on a pro rata basis to (x) the holders of the remaining public shares based on their percentage of Class A common stock held after redemptions and the issuance of any forward purchase shares, as distributable redeemable warrants and (y) the holders of the forward purchase shares based on their percentage of Class A common stock held after redemptions and the issuance of any forward purchase shares, as private placement warrants. Public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights are not entitled to receive any distribution of distributable redeemable warrants in respect of such redeemed public shares.
 
The distribution of the distributable redeemable warrants in respect of a public share is contingent upon such share not being redeemed in connection with our initial business combination, and the number of distributable redeemable warrants to be distributed in respect of each such unredeemed public shares will be contingent upon the aggregate number of public shares that are redeemed. The contingent rights to receive distributable redeemable warrants will remain attached to our Class A common stock, will not be separately transferrable, assignable or salable, and will not be evidenced by any certificate or instrument.
 
Our distributable redeemable warrants are otherwise identical to our detachable redeemable warrants, including with respect to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. No fractional distributable redeemable warrants will be issued, no cash will be paid in lieu of fractional distributable redeemable warrants and only whole distributable redeemable warrants will trade. The distributable redeemable warrants will be fungible with our detachable redeemable warrants and will become tradable upon their distribution under the same stock symbol as the detachable redeemable warrants.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. Pursuant to the forward purchase agreement, the forward purchasers have agreed that they will not redeem any Class A common stock held by them in connection with the initial business combination. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions pursuant to a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
17

 

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our Nasdaq listing or Exchange Act registration.
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will count towards this quorum and have agreed to vote any founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 
18

 

Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, without our prior consent, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
16

 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If the Cyxtera Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target by September 14, 2022, which is 24 months from the closing of the IPO.
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the IPO (i.e., until September 14, 2022) to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by September 14, 2022, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our redeemable warrants, and our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will have been issued if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO.
 
Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers and directors acquires public shares after the IPO, it will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A common stock the right to have their shares redeemed or to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).
 
We expect to use the amounts held outside the trust account ($2,557,154 as of December 31, 2020) to pay for all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants to the sponsor, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risks Relating to our Securities — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors described above. Under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.
 
18

 
In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or (2) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of permitted withdrawals, except as to any claims by a third party that executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether any such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of permitted withdrawals, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely.
 
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risks Relating to our Securities — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors described above.
 
We seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to the amounts held outside the trust account ($2,557,154 as of December 31, 2020) to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000), but these amounts may be spent on expenses incurred as a result of being a public company or due diligence expenses on prospective business combination candidates. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by September 14, 2022 may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
19

 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by September 14, 2022, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by September 14, 2022, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, we seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of permitted withdrawals and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risks Relating to our Search for, Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination and Post-Business Combination Risks — If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.”

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by September 14, 2022 or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with our initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
 
Our offices are located at 777 Third Avenue, 18th Floor, New York, New York 10017, and our telephone number is (212) 845-7977. Our corporate website address is StarboardSVAC.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Annual Report. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities.
Employees
 
We currently have three officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person devotes to our company in any time period varies based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our units, Class A common stock and redeemable warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) or International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer an emerging growth company will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
