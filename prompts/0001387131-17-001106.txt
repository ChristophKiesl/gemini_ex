--------+---------

GENERAL
 
Where Food Comes From, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“WFCF”, “the Company”, “our”, “we”, or “us”) is a leading trusted resource for third-party verification of food production practices in North America. The Company supports more than 12,000 farmers, ranchers, vineyards, wineries, processors, retailers, distributors, trade associations and restaurants with a wide variety of value-added services provided through its family of verifiers, including IMI Global, International Certification Services (ICS), Validus Verification Services, Sterling Solutions, and our newest acquisition, SureHarvest Services (SureHarvest). In order to have credibility, product claims such as gluten-free, non-GMO, non-hormone treated, humane handling, and others require verification by an independent third-party such as WFCF. The Company’s principal business is conducting both on-site and desk audits to verify that claims being made about livestock, crops and other food products are accurate. In addition, the Company’s Where Food Comes From Source Verified® retail and restaurant labeling program utilizes the verification of product attributes to connect consumers directly to the source of the food they purchase through product labeling and web-based information sharing and education. With the use of Quick Response Code (“QR”) technology, consumers can instantly access information about the producers behind their food.
 
WFCF was founded in 1996 and incorporated in the state of Colorado as a subchapter C corporation in 2005. The Company’s shares of common stock trade on the OTCQB marketplace under the stock ticker symbol, “WFCF”.
 
The Company’s original name – Integrated Management Information, Inc. (d.b.a. IMI Global, Inc.) – was changed to Where Food Comes From, Inc. in 2012 to better reflect the Company’s mission. Early growth was attributable to source and age verification services for beef producers who wanted access to markets overseas following the discovery of “mad cow” disease in the U.S. Over the years, WFCF has expanded its portfolio to include verification and software services for most food groups and 30 standards. This growth has been achieved both organically and through the acquisition of other companies.
 
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
What We Do
 
The Company is one of the nation’s largest independent, third-party provider of food production audits and uses rigorous verification processes to ensure that claims made by food producers and processors are accurate.
 
The Where Food Comes From® labeling program offers food retailers and restaurants a means of connecting consumers to information on where and how the food they purchase has been grown or raised.
 
With the acquisition of SureHarvest on December 28, 2016, the Company employs a software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue model that bundles annual software licenses with ongoing software enhancements and upgrades and a wide range of professional services that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry.
 
The Company’s business benefits from growing demand by consumers, retailers and government for increased transparency into food production practices.
 
Consumers: Due to concerns about food safety, animal welfare and an overall increase in health consciousness, consumers are demanding more information about the food they purchase.

Retailers: Responding to consumer demands for increased transparency as well as to the negative impact food scandals have on their bottom lines, retailers are requiring their suppliers to adhere to more stringent traceability and verification of product claims.
 
Government Regulation: The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Animal Disease Traceability program, being phased in over the next few years, gluten-free testing requirements, and ingredient labeling regulations are all impacting product verification.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Due to organic growth in our portfolio of auditing standards, consumer demand and acquisitions, our sales have grown rapidly from $1.1 million in 2006 to $11.6 million in 2016, a 10-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 27%.
 
Our growth strategy is as follows:
 
● | To cover more food groups than any other verification provider. Currently we verify beef, lamb, pork, poultry, dairy, eggs, produce and grain. In the future we hope to include seafood, beverages and other produce. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To offer solutions for ALL participants in the food supply chain including feed and input providers, ranchers, producers, packers, auction barns, processors, distributors, restaurants, retailers and consumers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To expand on the industry’s largest solutions portfolio. We currently are verifying or certifying to more than 30 certification standards or guidelines. To our knowledge, that is the most in the industry. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To continue organic growth. We leverage our ‘bundling’ capability to aggressively pursue new customers, while sustaining our recurring revenue model and high retention rates. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To continue growth through merger and acquisition opportunities. Through selective acquisitions, we can expand our footprint, add new services, food groups and revenue streams. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In line with our growth strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities as a means of achieving our long-term strategic objectives.

Additionally, the software as a service (SaaS) model bundles annual software subscriptions with professional services to provide predictable, recurring revenue.
 
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 
 
The value-added food industry has been growing rapidly for the past several years in response to increased consumer interest about food production. Per the 2010 U.S. Census, less than 1% of United States citizens are involved in producing food; thus there is a growing interest from consumers regarding how their food is produced. We are also in an increasingly global food market with food products traveling around the world, and brands differentiating themselves in the market. These key drivers are increasing the number of food labeling claims made on food products. Natural and/or organic are examples of food labels that indicate that the food or other agricultural product has been produced a certain way.
 
Natural and organic sales are only part of the story of how consumers look for the verification of practices tied to food labeling claims. Other factors are also becoming increasingly more important to consumers, evidenced on menus and product labels. While not an exhaustive list, some of the issues that farms, ranches, producers, processors, restaurants and retailers are addressing include: how animals are cared for and handled, how a product’s production impacts the environment and societies, and what inputs were used in the production of food items (like antibiotics).
 
As consumers want more assurance about the trustworthiness of labeling claims, there is a growing trend for verification of raising practices. Additionally, as the agriculture, livestock and food industry continues to mature and expand internationally, there is an increasing need to record, manage, report and verify information regarding the source, age, genetic background, animal treatment, nutrition, and other credence attributes. We believe verification of labeling claims by an independent third-party can meet consumer demands and expectations. Third-party verification also benefits producers, processors, distributors, restaurants, and retailers by addressing marketplace differentiation and global competitiveness.
 
Current Marketplace Opportunities
 
Because of growing demand for increased transparency into food production practices, we believe there are three main market drivers to promote forward momentum for our business:
 
Market Driver #1 - Consumer awareness and expectations
 

● | A recent survey conducted by Acosta, a leading full-service sales and marketing agency in the consumer packaged goods industry, which was released in 2015, indicates consumers are actually changing their shopping habits in the grocery store. Increasingly more Americans are shopping the perimeter of the grocery store rather than stocking their pantries, and choosing to cook healthy meals at home, even if it comes at a higher cost. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | According to the US Grocery Shopper Trends 2014 Report, more than 25% of consumers surveyed are seeking products that are minimally processed, locally grown or produced, with recognizable and a short list of ingredients. Jenny Zegler, Global Food and Drink Analyst at Mintel, said “These trends explore how consumers’ evolving priorities, opportunities from advancements in functional formulation and the almost inescapable reach of technology will affect food and drink in the coming year. Consumers are not only the influencers, as shifting economics, natural phenomena and social media are shaping what, how, where and with whom consumers are choosing to eat and drink…” 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Based on a survey in the March 13, 2014 Cone Communication Food Issues Trend Tracker, food safety and nutritional value rose to the top as the most important factors when hitting the grocery aisles. Additionally, at least two-thirds of Americans prioritized the following as significant factors when deciding what makes it into the shopping cart: locally produced, sustainable packaging, animal welfare, non-GMO, protection and renewal of natural resources. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Three in five Americans are on the lookout for non GMO-labeled foods when shopping. Per the March 13, 2014 Cone Communication Food Issues Trend Tracker, 39% believe that non-GMO foods are healthier, 32% are concerned about the effects on the environment, and 24% question the ethics behind the use of GMOs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | According to the USDA website, the U.S. market for certified organic products was estimated at more than $39 billion as of October 2015 while USDA-approved organic operations have grown more than 250% since 2002. Increasing consumer demand for healthy, better-for-you products produced with sustainable agricultural practices is driving growth in the organic market. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Market Driver #2 - Global competitiveness among retailers
 

● | Restaurant chains and retailers with dominant market shares and large buying power, like McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, are leading the way in prioritizing sustainable food supply initiatives in answer to consumer demands. With information literally at our fingertips, Google searches and smart phone apps are making it easier to expose where sustainable food supply chains are, and where they are not. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Producers, packers, distributors and retailers understand that verification, identification and traceability are key competitive differentiators. Oftentimes, it is necessary for export into international markets, including Korea, Russia and the European Union. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Driver #3 - Government regulation
 

● | In January 2013, the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) issued two major proposed rules regarding preventive controls in human/animal food and produce safety. Compliance dates for some businesses began September 2016. Under the new rules, the food safety plan defined by the regulation differs from traditional hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) plans. It must include a hazard analysis, preventive controls, monitoring procedures, corrective action procedures, verification procedures, a supply chain program, and a recall program. We have begun to see significant movement in companies requesting our consulting expertise to developing programs designed to assist them in maintaining compliance with the new rules. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Animal Disease Traceability Rule primarily covers beef cattle 18 months of age or older. Under the final rule, unless specifically exempted, livestock moved interstate must be officially identified and accompanied by an interstate certificate of veterinary inspection or other documentation, such as owner-shipper statements or brand certificates. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | The Saudi Arabia market closed to U.S. beef in 2012. Since that time, the beef industry has been working with the U.S. government to re-open that market, which officially happened in early August 2016. In order to be approved to meet the export requirements, a company must have or must be approved by a process verified plan (PVP), like our Verified Natural product. U.S. exports to Saudi Arabia in 2010 and 2011 were valued at approximately $30 million. We believe the Saudi Arabia market focuses on the highest quality middle meats, making it a valuable market for the U.S. to re-gain access. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | After a recent visit to the US which included an audit of the beef supply chain, Chinese officials announced in September 2016 that the ban on imports of US beef has been lifted. While the technical requirements for export verification have yet to be determined, source and age verification will be required, at a minimum. China is the world’s second largest buyer of beef, but beef imports from the US to China have been banned since the 2003 Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak, also known as “Mad Cow Disease.”

Current Concerns in Our Industry 
 
US Beef
 
U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU) must be third-party verified as High Quality Beef (a USDA feeding claim) and non-hormone treated cattle (NHTC). With duty-free access to the EU lowering the cost of doing business in Europe, we believe that it offers significantly more potential for third-party NHTC verification services and High Quality Beef verification services. However, due to the current strength of the US dollar, we are seeing downward pressure on NHTC cattle prices causing the momentum of these programs to slow.
 
Cattle markets moved to the lowest level since 2011 in the continuation of a trend that began during the first quarter of this year. High prices in cattle date back to the drought of 2012. When grain prices exploded to all-time highs, animal protein producers could not afford to feed their herds. As feed prices rose, producers sent the animals to processing plants early to avoid losses that would result from high feed costs. It takes between 18 and 24 months to raise cattle, so thus began the great cattle bull market of 2014. Moreover, the population of planet Earth now stands at over 7.3 billion people. In Asia, diets have changed as wealth has grown. A traditional rice-based diet now includes more complex proteins, which has increased demand for beef and pork in the region. In 2015 and early 2016, ample supplies of grains lowered the input costs for producing cattle. Therefore, lower grain or feed prices filtered through and caused the price of live cattle to drop over the course of 2015, and this continued into 2016.
 
During the second quarter, a rally in soybean and soybean product prices caused feed prices to rally. Live cattle prices fell as producers were facing a scenario similar to what they saw in 2012. The potential for an early slaughter to avoid high feed prices caused live cattle futures to fall as soybeans, and other grain prices moved higher. Slower growth in China along with rising feed prices contributed to lower cattle prices during 2016. Lower cattle prices are driving many producers to reduce overall operating costs, which includes opting out of certain verification programs.
 
We believe this may be a short-sighted reaction and we encourage our customers to stay in those verification programs. We continue to see higher premiums paid for verified beef. We also know that early slaughter creates a short-term oversupply and increases the chances of another shortage developing in 2017 as herd sizes decline. Retail meats markets have remained virtually unchanged. At this time, we have no way to reasonably estimate the future impact this could have on our business. Management continues to monitor the situation. We believe we have diversified our product offerings across multiple species such that it did not have a significant negative impact on our 2016 operations.

SALES 
 
Our revenues are generated primarily from third-party verification services, hardware sales and our labeling program, Where Food Comes From®. We sell our products and services directly to customers at various levels in the agriculture, food and livestock supply chain. Our customers include some of the largest U.S. beef and pork packers, organic producers and processors, and specialty retail chains. No single customer generated more than 10% of total net revenue in 2016 or 2015.
Service Revenues
 
We offer a wide array of verification and certification services to help food producers, brands and consumers differentiate certain attributes and production methods in the marketplace. We are recognized and utilized by numerous standard setting bodies as an accredited verification or certification service provider. We enable food producers and brands to make certain claims on live animals or packaged food products by verifying that they are meeting the standards or guidelines associated with the claim(s) they are making.
 
Most of our service offerings can be bundled to provide a “one-stop shop” for customers that have multiple levels of verification and certification needs, such as source verification and food safety certification.
 
We also offer consulting, program development and web-based development services on a customized basis to meet special customer requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our third-party verification programs provided 88.8% and 87.3% of our total revenue, respectively.
 
Product Sales
 
In support of our third-party verification service offerings, we offer hardware products (primarily cattle identification ear tags) to our customers. While these hardware products have lower profit margins than our proprietary offerings, they allow us to offer our customers a comprehensive solution. Approximately 10.2% and 11.6% of our total revenue was provided by the sale of hardware during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Other Revenue 
 
All of our verification products that are source-verified qualify for our WhereFoodComesFrom® verification seal of approval. As a third-party verification service provider, we must review each individual producer’s or food company’s claim and system to ensure that 100 percent of the supply is managed through a third-party verification program recognized by the USDA, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and/or another internationally recognized standard setting body. This revenue stream primarily represents a price per pound fee for use of our WhereFoodComesFrom® label.
 
The WhereFoodComesFrom® labeling program offers food retailers and restaurants a means of connecting consumers to information on where and how the food they purchase has been grown or raised. Grocery stores and restaurants can display the Where Food Comes From® label along with a quick response (QR) code consumers can scan with smart phones to access information on the farmers and ranchers who produce food for that establishment.
 
We offer incentives to select producers and processors who exclusively use our verification and certification services in connection with our distinctive brand.
 
MARKETING
 
Our marketing strategy includes direct marketing, advertising, event sponsorship, and trade show participation. From a public relations perspective, members of our staff are frequently quoted in industry trade journals and requested as speakers at various industry events as subject matter experts on the topics of animal identification, traceability, branding, third-party verification and certification, and the USDA verification programs.

In order to reach additional customers, we continually develop strategic marketing partnerships with leading companies in the industry with complementary abilities and products. We do not currently rely on any third-party contracts with distributors, licenses or manufacturers in conducting our business.
 
We also use social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to help promote our business, market our product offerings, and connect consumers with current topics in the agriculture, livestock and food industry.
 
COMPETITION 
 
The competition for third-party verification services in the food and agriculture industry is growing more intense, especially within the organic market. As of December 31, 2016, we estimate that there are approximately 8 key competitors serving the food and agricultural industry, including Quality Assurance International, California Certified Organic Farmers, Oregon Tilth, Organic Crop Improvement Association, Earth Claims, FoodChain ID, NSF International, SGS and SCS Global Services. Differentiation hinges upon understanding all facets of food verification and the complex compliance challenges to make product verifications efficient, cost-effective, and seamless. Our core business and expertise focuses on the “on farm” verifications to a variety of standards, guidelines and criteria including source verification, natural, animal care and well-being, and sustainability verification.
SEASONALITY
 
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of our revenues are typically realized during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year when the calf marketings and crop production are at their peak. Because of the seasonality of the business and our industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We create, own and maintain a variety of intellectual property assets that we believe are among our most valuable assets. Our intellectual property assets include patents and patent applications related to our innovations, products and services, trademarks related to our brands, products and services, and other property rights. We also have licensing arrangements when features from our programs are desirable to incorporate into either a new or an existing technology we offer. We seek to protect our intellectual property right assets through patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other laws of the United States and other countries, and through contractual provisions. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 60 employees. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the performance of our key senior management personnel, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our employees is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
