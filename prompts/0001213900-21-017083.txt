ITEM 1. | BUSINESS OVERVIEW
--------+------------------

 
Rubicon Technology, Inc. (“Rubicon” or the “Company”) consists of two operating subsidiaries, Rubicon Technology Worldwide LLC (“RTW”) and Rubicon DTP LLC (“Direct Dose” or “DDRX”).
 
RTW is a vertically integrated, advanced materials provider specializing in monocrystalline sapphire for applications in optical and industrial systems. We design, assemble and maintain our own proprietary crystal growth furnaces to grow high-purity, low-stress, ultra-low-defect-density sapphire crystals. We use our proprietary crystal growth technology to produce high-quality sapphire products to meet our customers’ exacting specifications. Sapphire is a desirable material for high-performance applications due to its hardness and strength, transparency in the visible and infrared spectrum, thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, abrasion resistance, high melting point and chemical inertness. As a result, it is ideally suited for extreme environments in a range of industries where material durability is just as important as optical clarity. We believe that we continue to have a reputation as one of the highest quality sapphire producers in the market. We provide optical and industrial sapphire products in a variety of shapes and sizes, including round and rectangular windows, blanks, domes, tubes and rods.
 
Historically, we have also provided sapphire products to the LED and mobile device markets, which are the largest markets for sapphire. However, given competitive pressures in those markets, in the fourth quarter of 2016 we announced our decision to focus on the optical and industrial sapphire markets and exit the LED market. Following this decision, we closed our Malaysia facility and scaled down and consolidated our remaining operations in the U.S. In the succeeding years we have completed individual sales and held auctions for assets located in Malaysia and at each of our U.S. properties, resulting in the sale of certain of our excess equipment and consumable assets. In December 2019 we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell our manufacturing facility located in Malaysia and it was completed in June 2020. In December 2020, Rubicon sold all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of its wholly owned subsidiary Rubicon Sapphire Technology (Malaysia) SDN BHD. We are continuing to pursue the sale of our vacant parcel of land located in Batavia, Illinois. The timing on the sale of this real estate is difficult to predict.
 
We manage direct sales, grow and fabricate sapphire parts and ship from our owned facility located in Bensenville, Illinois.
 
Our sapphire business operates in a very competitive market. Our ability to expand our optical and industrial business and the acceptance of new product offerings are difficult to predict. Our total sales backlog was approximately $747,000 and $1,625,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
In May 2019, the Company established Direct Dose and acquired certain assets, hired employees and sublet a facility from a pharmacy that was in the process of liquidation. Direct Dose was launched as a start-up pharmacy primarily to deliver medications and vitamins to patients being discharged from skilled nursing facilities. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, patient census at skilled nursing facilities plummeted and DDRX started to work with home health care agencies for customer acquisitions.
 
Since RTW and Direct Dose serve smaller markets than our historical undertakings, we are actively evaluating the acquisition of profitable companies in order to utilize our substantial net operating loss (“NOL”) tax carryforwards.
 
Rubicon Technology, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated on February 7, 2001. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol “RBCN.”
 
Sapphire INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
 
Sapphire is utilized in optical and industrial applications. It is used for windows and optics for aerospace, sensor, medical, semiconductor, instrumentation, electronics and laser applications due to its wide-band transmission, superior strength, chemical and scratch resistance and high strength-to-weight ratio. Sapphire’s physical and optical properties also make it very well suited for defense applications such as electro-optical and sensor suite windows for military fighter jets, helicopters, unmanned air vehicles and ships, forward-looking infrared windows for commercial and business aircrafts, as well as missile domes, submarine windows and components and transparent armor for military vehicles.

PRODUCTS 
 
We believe the developing optical and industrial markets require large-diameter sapphire products, high-quality sapphire and ultra-thin double-side polished windows and wafers which may be beyond the capability of many sapphire suppliers. In addition, military and defense applications often require a U.S.-based source for their parts. We believe we continue to have a reputation for producing the highest quality optical-grade sapphire. We also have the ability to maintain the same high quality in crystals of very large sizes, to support a strong and developing U.S. customer base, and to provide very high performance ultra-thin double-side polished sapphire products, which we believe positions us well in the optical, laser, and epitaxial growth markets.
 
We provide optical and industrial sapphire products in various shapes and sizes, including round and rectangular windows and blanks, domes, tubes and rods. These optical sapphire products are qualified and used in equipment for a wide variety of end markets and high performance applications, including defense and aerospace, specialty lighting, instrumentation, sensors and detectors, semiconductor process equipment, electronic substrates, medical and laser applications.
 
We believe we offer the industry’s largest sapphire windows and highest quality, ultra-thin, double-side polished windows and substrates. Our product lines include very thin, double-side polished windows as thin as 300 microns for 6” optical diameter substrates, and also very large-area blanks and polished windows. We offer round C-plane sapphire windows up to 11” in diameter and A-plane windows up to 18” in diameter with UV grade windows up to 13.5” in diameter. We also have produced sapphire window blanks at 36” x 18” x 0.8” dimensions.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
In 2020 and 2019, Rubicon did not incur any research and development (“R&D”) expenses and it currently does not have any plans for expenditures in 2021 related to R&D.
MANUFACTURING 
 
The process of growing crystal begins by heating the raw material, aluminum oxide, until it reaches an ideal temperature above its melting point. This ideal temperature is essential for our process because it allows us to produce high-purity crystals with very low defect rates. Following the heating, a seed rod is inserted in the melted material as the material is being cooled to crystallize into a boule. Following the growth process, each boule is rigorously inspected by using polarized lighting and magnification to find imperfections, such as bubbles, dislocations and granular deposits within the crystal. We then drill the resulting boules into cylindrical cores using our custom high-precision crystal orientation equipment and proprietary processes. For some of our parts, the cores are then finished through an outsourcing model using trusted partners.
 
We are dedicated to quality assurance throughout our entire operation. We employ detailed material traceability from raw material to finished product. Our quality system is certified as ISO9001:2000.
 
All of our long-lived assets are located in the United States.
 
SALES AND MARKETING 
 
We market and sell our products through our direct sales force to customers. Our direct sales team includes experienced and technically sophisticated sales professionals and engineers who are knowledgeable in the development, manufacturing and use of sapphire windows and other optical materials. Our sales staff works with customers during all stages of the manufacturing process, from developing the precise composition of the parts through manufacturing and processing the parts to the customers’ specifications.
 
A key component of our marketing strategy is developing and maintaining strong relationships with our customers. We achieve this by working closely with our customers to optimize our products for their production processes. In addition, we are able to develop long-term relationships with key customers by offering product specification assistance, providing direct access to enable them to evaluate and audit our operations, delivering high-quality products and providing superior customer service. We believe that maintaining close relationships with our customers’ senior management and providing technical support improves customer satisfaction.

CUSTOMERS 
 
Our principal customers have been defense subcontractors, industrial manufacturers, fabricators and resellers. A substantial portion of our sales have been to a small number of customers. In 2020, our top four customers (each 10% or greater of our revenues) accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 55% of our revenue and in 2019, the top three customers accounted for approximately 58% of our revenue. Although we are attempting to diversify and expand our customer base, we expect our sales to continue to be concentrated among a small number of customers. However, we also expect that our significant customers may change from time to time. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues during 2020 or 2019 other than those referred to above.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
We rely primarily upon a combination of know-how, patents, trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements with employees, customers and potential customers to protect our intellectual property. However, we believe that factors such as the technological and innovative abilities of our personnel, the success of our ongoing product development efforts and our efforts to maintain trade secret protection are more important than patents in maintaining our competitive position.
COMPETITION 
 
The markets for high-quality sapphire products are very competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change. The products we produce must meet certain demanding requirements to succeed in the marketplace. Although we are a well-established sapphire producer, we face significant competition from other established providers of similar products as well as from new and potential entrants into our markets.
 
We have several competitors that compete directly with us. We believe that the key competitive factors in our markets are:
 

● | consistently producing high-quality products in the desired size, orientation and finish; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | producing large-format high-quality crystal for certain applications; 
● | providing an United States based source of sapphire for military applications; and 
● | the financial stability of a company. 

 
We believe the developing optical and industrial markets require cost effective high-quality sapphire, large-diameter sapphire products and ultra-thin double-side polished windows and wafers, which we have the capabilities to provide while certain other sapphire producers may not. In addition, defense applications often require a U.S.-based source for sapphire. We believe we continue to have a reputation for producing the highest quality sapphire in the market. We believe this positions us well with competitive advantages in the markets for optical and industrial sapphire.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
 
In our manufacturing process, we use water, oils, slurries, acids, adhesives and other industrial chemicals. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of these materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These include statutory and regulatory provisions under which we are responsible for the management of hazardous materials we use and the disposition of hazardous wastes resulting from our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with such provisions, whether intentional or inadvertent, could result in fines and other liabilities to the government or third parties, injunctions requiring us to suspend or curtail operations or other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The cost of complying with environmental regulation is not material.
