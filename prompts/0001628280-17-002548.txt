Item 1. Business
The Company

The Company is a natural health and wellness company primarily engaged in the manufacturing and direct selling of nutritional and personal care products. The Company is a Utah corporation with its principal place of business in Lehi, Utah, and sells its products to a sales force of independent distributors that uses the products themselves or resells them to consumers.
Business Segments

The Company has four business segments that are divided based on the different characteristics of their distributor bases, selling and distributor compensation plans and product formulations, as well as the internal organization of its officers and their responsibilities and business operations.  Three business segments operate under the Nature’s Sunshine Products brand (NSP Americas; NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe; and China and New Markets). The Company’s China and New Markets segment anticipates deploying a multi-channel go-to-market strategy that offers select Nature’s Sunshine branded products through direct selling, e-commerce and retail channels across China.  The time to market will be dependent upon regulatory processes including product registration, permit and license approvals in China. The China and New Markets segment also includes the Company’s wholesale business, in which the Company sells its products to various locally-managed entities independent of the Company that the Company has granted distribution rights for the relevant market. The fourth business segment operates under the Synergy® WorldWide brand.
The Company markets its products in Australia, Austria, Belarus, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Company markets its products through a wholesale model to Australia, Brazil, Chile, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Spain and the United Kingdom.
Product Categories

The Company’s line of over 700 products includes several different product classifications, such as immune, cardiovascular, digestive, personal care, weight management and other general health products. It purchases herbs and other raw materials in bulk and, after rigorous quality control testing, it formulates, encapsulates, tablets or concentrates them, labels and packages them for shipment. Most of its products are manufactured at its facility in Spanish Fork, Utah. Contract manufacturers produce some of the Company's products in accordance with the Company's exacting specifications and standards. The Company has implemented stringent quality control procedures to verify that its contract manufacturers have complied with its specifications and standards.

Presented below are the U.S. dollar amounts and associated revenue percentages from the sale of general health, immune, cardiovascular, digestive, personal care and weight management products for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, by business segment. This table should be read in conjunction with the information presented in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which discusses the factors impacting revenue trends and the costs associated with generating the aggregate revenue presented (in thousands).

Distribution and Selling

The Company’s independent distributors, known as Managers and Distributors, market products to customers through direct selling techniques, as well as sponsoring other independent distributors. The Company seeks to motivate and provide incentives to its independent distributors by offering high quality products and providing its independent distributors with product support, training seminars, sales conventions, travel programs and financial incentives.

The Company’s products sold in the United States are shipped directly from its manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in Spanish Fork, Utah, as well as from its regional warehouses located in Georgia, Ohio and Texas. Many of the Company's international operations maintain warehouse facilities and inventory to supply their independent Managers, Distributors and customers. However, in foreign markets where it does not maintain warehouse facilities, it has contracted with third-parties to distribute its products and provide support services to its independent sales force of independent Managers and Distributors.

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 243,600 "active independent Distributors and customers" (as defined below). A person who joins the Company’s independent sales force begins as an independent Distributor. Many independent Distributors sell the Company’s products on a part-time basis to friends or associates or use the products themselves. An independent Distributor may earn Manager status by attaining certain product sales levels. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 12,900 "active independent Managers" (as defined below) worldwide. In many of the Company's markets, its independent Managers and Distributors are primarily retailers of the Company's products, including practitioners, proprietors of retail stores and other health and wellness specialists.

In the United States, the Company generally sells its products on a cash or credit card basis. From time to time, the Company's U.S. operations extend short-term credit associated with product promotions. For certain of its international operations, the Company uses independent distribution centers and offers credit terms that are generally consistent with industry standards within each respective country.

The Company pays sales commissions, or “volume incentives” to its independent Managers and Distributors based upon their own product sales and the product sales of their sales organization. As an exception, China does not pay volume incentives; rather, it pays independent service fees. These volume incentives are recorded as an expense in the year earned. The amounts of volume incentives that the Company expensed during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, are set forth in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. In addition to the opportunity to receive volume incentives, independent Managers who attain certain levels of monthly product sales are eligible for additional incentive programs including automobile allowances, sales convention privileges and travel awards.

Distributor Information

The Company’s revenue is highly dependent upon the number and productivity of its independent Managers and Distributors.  Growth in sales volume requires an increase in the productivity and/or growth in the total number of independent Managers and Distributors.
Within the Company, there are a number of different distributor compensation plans and qualifications, which generate active independent Managers and Distributors with different sales values in its different business segments. Within Synergy WorldWide, the sales qualifications required for active independent Managers and Distributors varies by market according to local economic factors. As sales grow in markets with higher qualification values, and decline in those with lower qualification values, the resultant mix change influences the active counts for independent Managers and Distributors. As a result, from time-to-time, changes in overall active counts for independent Managers and Distributors may not be indicative of actual sales trends for the segment.
The following table provides information concerning the number of total independent Managers, Distributors and customers by segment, as of the dates indicated.

 Source and Availability of Raw Materials

Raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products are generally available from a number of suppliers. To date, the Company has not experienced any major difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate sources of raw materials supply. The Company attempts to ensure the availability of many of its raw materials by contracting, in advance, for its annual requirements. In the past, it has been able to find alternative sources of raw materials when needed. Although there can be no assurance that it will be successful in locating such sources of supply in the future, the Company believes that it will be able to do so.
Trademarks and Trade Names

The Company has obtained trademark registrations for Nature’s Sunshine®, and the landscape logo for all of its Nature’s Sunshine Products product lines. It has also obtained trademark registrations for Synergy Worldwide® for all of the Company's Synergy WorldWide product lines. The Company holds trademark registrations in the United States and in many other countries. The Company's customers’ recognition and association of its brands and trademarks with quality is an important element of its operating strategy.
The duration of the Company's trademark registrations is generally between 10 and 20 years, depending on the country in which the marks are registered, and can be renewed. The scope and duration of the Company's intellectual property protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction and by individual product.
Seasonality

The Company operates in many regions around the world and, as a result, is affected by seasonal factors and trends such as weather changes, holidays and cultural traditions and vacation patterns throughout the world.  For instance, in North America and Europe the Company typically experiences a decrease in activity during the third quarter due to the summer vacation season, while it experiences a decrease in activity in many of its Asia Pacific markets during the first quarter due to cultural events such as the Lunar New Year. As a result, there is some seasonality to the Company's revenues and expenses reflected in its reported quarterly results. Generally, reductions in one region of the world due to seasonality are offset by increases in another, minimizing the impact on the Company's reported consolidated revenues. Changes in the relative size of the Company's revenues in one region of the world compared to another could cause seasonality to more significantly affect the Company's reported quarterly results.
Inventories

In order to provide a high level of product availability to the Company's independent Managers, Distributors, and customers, it maintains a considerable inventory of raw materials in the United States and of finished goods in most countries in which it sells its products. Due to different regulatory requirements across the countries in which the Company sells its products, its finished goods inventories have product labels and sometimes product formulations specific for each country. The Company's inventories are subject to obsolescence due to finite shelf lives.
Dependence upon Customers

A significant amount of the Company's revenue in some of its markets is dependent on only a few independent distributors and their extensive sales networks. The loss of one or more of these independent distributors who, together with their extensive sales network generate a significant amount of the Company's revenue, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition on one or more of the Company's business segments.
Backlog

The Company typically ships orders for its products within 24 hours after receipt of payment. As a result, it has not historically experienced significant backlogs due to its high level of product availability as discussed above.
10


Competition

The Company's products are sold in competition with other companies, some of which have greater sales volumes and financial resources than the Company does, and sell brands that are, through advertising and promotions, better known to consumers. The Company competes in the nutritional and personal care industry against companies that sell through retail stores, as well as against other direct selling companies. For example, it competes against manufacturers and retailers of nutritional and personal care products, which are distributed through supermarkets, drug stores, health food stores, vitamin outlets, discount stores, and mass market retailers, among others. It competes for product sales and independent distributors with many other direct selling companies, including Amway, Herbalife, Nu Skin, Shaklee and USANA, among others. The Company believes that the principal components of competition in the direct selling of nutritional and personal care products are distributor expertise and service, product quality and differentiation, price and brand recognition. In addition, the Company relies on its independent Managers and Distributors to compete effectively in the direct selling markets, and its ability to attract and retain independent Managers and Distributors depends on various factors, including the training, quality product offerings and financial incentives for the independent Managers and Distributors.
Research and Development

The Company conducts research and development activities at its manufacturing facility located in Spanish Fork, Utah. During 2015, the Company opened the Hughes Center for Research and Innovation, a new state of the art research and development facility at its corporate offices in Lehi, Utah, which will further advance the Company's research of innovative products. The Company's principal emphasis in its research and development activities is clinical research in the support of the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products. The amount, excluding capital expenditures, spent on research and development activities was approximately $3.2 million in 2016, $2.8 million in 2015 and $2.5 million in 2014.
Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations

The nature of the Company's business has not required any material capital expenditures to comply with federal, state or local provisions enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. No material capital expenditures to meet such provisions are anticipated. Such regulatory provisions have not had any material effect upon the Company's results of operations or competitive position.
Regulation

General

In both the United States and foreign markets, the Company is affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations and guidance, court decisions and similar constraints (collectively “Regulations”). Such Regulations exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, including Regulations pertaining to: (1) the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of its products; (2) product and earnings claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by the Company, as well as claims and advertising by independent distributors, for which the Company may be held responsible; (3) the Company's direct selling program; (4) transfer pricing and similar regulations that affect the level of U.S. and foreign taxable income and customs duties; (5) taxation of its independent distributors (which in some instances may impose an obligation on the Company to collect the taxes and maintain appropriate records); and (6) currency exchange and repatriation.
Products

The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of each of the Company's major product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies in the United States and in other countries. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the Company's products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder (“FDCA”). The FDCA defines the terms “food” and “dietary supplement” and sets forth various conditions that, unless complied with, may constitute adulteration or misbranding of such products. The FDCA has been adjusted several times with respect to dietary supplements, most recently by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (“NLEA”) and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (“DSHEA”).

FDA regulations relating specifically to foods and dietary supplements for human use are set forth in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations include basic labeling requirements for both foods and dietary supplements. In 
11

May 2016, the FDA announced new labeling requirements to reflect recently available scientific information. The new label requirements are designed to make it easier for consumers to make informed choices. Manufacturers have until July 26, 2018, to comply with the new labeling requirements. Additionally, FDA regulations require the Company to meet relevant good manufacturing practice regulations for the preparation, packaging and storage of its food and dietary supplements.

FDA rules impose requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, holding, and distribution of dietary supplement products. For example, it requires that companies establish written procedures governing areas such as: (1) personnel, (2) plant and equipment cleanliness, (3) production controls, (4) laboratory operations, (5) packaging and labeling, (6) distribution, (7) product returns, and (8) complaint handling. The FDA also requires identity testing of all incoming dietary ingredients unless a company successfully petitions for an exemption from this testing requirement in accordance with the regulations. The current good manufacturing practices are designed to ensure that dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities, and are labeled to accurately reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products.
In some countries the Company is, or regulators may assert that the Company is, responsible for the conduct of its independent distributors, and regulations applicable to the activities of the Company's independent Managers and Distributors also affect its business. In these countries, regulators may request or require that the Company take steps to ensure that its independent distributors comply with regulations. The types of regulated conduct include: (1) representations concerning the Company's products; (2) earning representations made by the Company and/or its independent Distributors; (3) public media advertisements, which in foreign markets may require prior approval by regulators; (4) sales of products in markets in which the products have not been approved, licensed or certified for sale; and (5) classification by government agencies of the Company's independent distributors as employees of the Company.

In some markets, it is possible that improper product claims by independent Managers and Distributors could result in the Company's products being reviewed by regulatory authorities and, as a result, being classified or placed into another category as to which stricter regulations are applicable. In addition, the Company might be required to make labeling changes.

The Company is unable to predict the nature of any future regulations, nor can it predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on its business in the future. They could, however, require: (1) reformulation of some products not capable of being reformulated; (2) imposition of additional record keeping requirements; (3) expanded documentation of the properties of some products; (4) expanded or different labeling; (5) additional scientific substantiation regarding product ingredients, safety or usefulness; and/or (6) additional distributor compliance surveillance and enforcement action by the Company. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of the Company's products in the market, the Company may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, the Company works extensively with local authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals.  It must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country.  Its failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.

Direct Selling

The Company's business practices and products are also regulated by the following United States governmental entities: the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). The Company's activities, including its direct selling distribution activities, are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which its products are sold.

The FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of the Company's products in the United States, has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. The FTC closely scrutinizes the use of testimonials, the role of expert endorsers and product clinical studies. The FTC has in recent years investigated and taken enforcement action against direct selling companies for misleading representations relating to the earnings potential of an independent distributor within a company's compensation plan, as well as appropriateness of the compensation plans themselves. For example, in 2015, the FTC initiated an enforcement action against a direct selling company, alleging an illegal business model and improper earnings claims, which the FTC and the direct selling company settled in September 2016, by entering into a stipulated order. In July 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement agreement with another direct selling company, which required the particular direct selling company to restructure its U.S. business operations 
12

to settle charges relating to deceptive advertising, misrepresentation and an illegal business model. The settlement of each of these cases required the direct selling company involved to, among other things, pay a significant fine, revise its compensation plan to comply with restrictions on how it can compensate its independent distributors and change its marketing practices to avoid misleading income, earning and other representations. The Company cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question its advertising or other operations in the future.

Transfer Pricing

In many countries, including the United States, the Company is subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by its U.S. or local entities and are taxed accordingly. In addition, the Company's operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of its products.

Although the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, it is subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit its transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed.

In the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to the Company, it may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. Because the laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, the Company cannot be sure that it would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future.

Other Regulations

The Company is also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets, including regulations pertaining to social security assessments, employment and severance pay requirements, import/export regulations and antitrust issues. As an example, in many markets, the Company is substantially restricted in the amount and types of rules and termination criteria that it can impose on its independent distributors without having to pay social security assessments on behalf of the independent distributors and without incurring severance obligations to terminated independent distributors. In some countries, the Company may be subject to these obligations in any event.

The Company's failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on its business in a particular market or in general. Assertions that the Company failed to comply with regulations or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could adversely affect it in other markets as well, by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets.

Compliance

In order to comply with regulations that apply to both the Company and its independent distributors, the Company conducts considerable research into the applicable regulatory framework prior to entering any new market to identify all necessary licenses and approvals and applicable limitations on the Company's operations in that market. Typically, it conducts this research with the assistance of local legal counsel and other representatives. The Company devotes substantial resources to obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals and bringing its operations into compliance with the applicable limitations. It also researches laws applicable to independent distributor operations and revises or alters its distributor manuals and other training materials and programs to provide independent distributors with guidelines for operating a business, selling and distributing its products and similar matters, as required by applicable regulations in each market. The Company is unable to monitor its independent distributors effectively, however, to ensure that they refrain from distributing its products in countries where it has not commenced operations, and it does not devote significant resources to this type of monitoring.

In addition, regulations in existing and new markets often are ambiguous and subject to considerable interpretive and enforcement discretion by the responsible regulators. Moreover, even when the Company believes that it and its independent Distributors are initially in compliance with all applicable regulations, new regulations regularly are being added and the interpretation of existing regulations is subject to change. Further, the content and impact of regulations to which the Company is subject may be influenced by public attention directed at it, its products or its direct selling program, so that extensive adverse publicity about the Company's products or its direct selling program may result in increased regulatory scrutiny.

It is an ongoing part of the Company's business to anticipate and respond to new and changing regulations and to make corresponding changes in its operations to the extent practicable. Although the Company devotes considerable resources to maintaining its compliance with regulatory constraints in each of its markets, it cannot be sure that (1) it would be found to be 
13

in full compliance with applicable regulations in all of its markets at any given time or (2) the regulatory authorities in one or more markets will not assert, either retroactively or prospectively or both, that its operations are not in full compliance. These assertions or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could negatively affect the Company in other markets as well, by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets. These assertions could have a material adverse effect on the Company in a particular market or in general. Furthermore, depending upon the severity of regulatory changes in a particular market and the changes in the Company's operations that would be necessitated to maintain compliance, these changes could result in the Company experiencing a material reduction in sales in the market or determining to exit the market altogether. In this event, the Company would attempt to devote the resources previously devoted to such market to a new market or markets or other existing markets. However, the Company cannot be sure that this transition would not have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations either in the short or long-term.

To further mitigate any compliance risk, a Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compliance Committee") was created in 2014. The purpose of the Compliance Committee is to oversee the Company’s efforts with respect to operational compliance.  “Operational Compliance” is defined by the Compliance Committee's charter to include: distributor compliance and direct selling best practices; employee compliance, including code of conduct and other mandated trainings; product and product distribution regulatory compliance, including adherence to FTC, FDA and other similar regulatory bodies’ mandates; and non-financial, whistleblower reports. For avoidance of doubt, "Operational Compliance" does not include adherence to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), which is the responsibility of the audit committee. The charter of the Compliance Committee requires that the Compliance Committee consist of at least three directors, one of whom must be the Chair of the Company’s Audit Committee, and that a majority of such members meet the independence and experience requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market, Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as affirmatively determined by the Company’s Board. The Board may, at any time and in its complete discretion, replace a Compliance Committee member.
International Operations

A significant portion of the Company's net sales are generated within the United States, which represented 43.4 percent, 45.4 percent and 40.5 percent of net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The Company's second largest market, South Korea, represented 16.9 percent, 14.9 percent and 14.8 percent of net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Outside of the United States and South Korea, no one country accounted for 10.0 percent or more of net sales in any year in the last three years. A breakdown of net sales by region in 2016, 2015, and 2014, is set forth below.

The Company's international operations are conducted in a manner that it believe is comparable with its U.S. operations; however, in order to conform to local variations, economic realities, market customs, consumer habits and regulatory environments, differences often exist in the products that the Company sells and in its distribution and selling programs.

The Company's international operations are subject to many of the same risks faced by its U.S. operations, including competition and local economic and political conditions. In addition, its international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including foreign regulatory restrictions, fluctuations in monetary exchange rates, import-export controls, effective management and support services by contracted third-parties and the economic and political policies of foreign governments. The significance of these risks will increase if the Company grows its international operations.
