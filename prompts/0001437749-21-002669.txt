Item 1. Business
Going Concern and Existing Second Lien Notes Restructuring
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had $120.6 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 9.125% Senior Secured Second Priority Notes due December 2021, which mature on December 15, 2021 (the “Existing Second Lien Notes”). The Existing Second Lien Notes, which are now classified as a current liability, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within the next twelve months. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements exclude certain adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our Existing Second Lien Notes, which could result in the acceleration of the maturity of the outstanding balance on our Credit Facility, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the amounts owed to holders of our Existing Second Lien Notes or to lenders under our Credit Facility.
 
  To address the upcoming maturity of our Existing Second Lien Notes, we executed a Restructuring Support Agreement supported by holders of our Existing Second Lien Notes representing approximately 92% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under our Existing Second Lien Notes, to effect certain restructuring transactions (the "Restructuring Transactions"), and we are seeking stockholder approval of such Restructuring Transactions to be voted at a special meeting of stockholders scheduled for February 23, 2021 ("the Special Meeting"). The Restructuring Transactions, as further discussed in Item 7. “ Liquidity and Capital Resources” and in Footnote 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, will allow us to extend the maturity of our Existing Second Lien Notes by four years to December 2025 by exchanging such notes for new convertible notes with a lower interest rate of 8% per annum. Accordingly, the consummation of the Restructuring Transactions and the conversion of the New Second Lien Notes, if converted, will have a substantial dilutive effect on our outstanding common stock. Shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in a concurrent rights offering to purchase the new convertible notes or our common stock in order to minimize dilution from the Restructuring Transactions. We anticipate the completion of the Restructuring Transactions by the end of March 2021. 
 
 We also entered into a restructuring support agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”), the lender of our Credit Facility,  (the "PNC Restructuring Support Agreement") that will allow us, among others, to consummate and implement the Restructuring Transactions and waive any going concern event of default that would otherwise occur under our Credit Facility.  
 
 While we believe we will be successful in obtaining stockholders' approval and executing the Restructuring Transactions, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate success, timing or extent of any such funding, which are dependent upon a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. In addition, no assurance can be given that any funding from the Restructuring Transactions, if approved by stockholders and obtained at all, will be adequate to fulfill our obligations and operate our business. Consequently, we may be required to obtain additional funding whether through private or public equity transactions, debt financing or other capital sources. We may not be able to take such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If additional funding cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, it will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
COVID-19 Business Impact and Response
 
The COVID-19 pandemic caused the global economy to enter a recessionary period, which may be prolonged and severe. During 2020, the exploration and production (“E&P”) industry faced the dual impact of demand deterioration from COVID-19 and market oversupply from increased production, which caused oil and natural gas prices to decline significantly for most of the year. Brent crude oil prices, which are most relevant to our internationally focused business, dropped 66% during the first quarter from $66 on January 1, 2020 to $23 on March 31, 2020. By the end of the second quarter, Brent crude oil prices rebounded to $41 per barrel, benefiting from increased global demand as pandemic restrictions started to ease and decreased production. Brent crude oil prices have remained relatively stable through the end of the year, increasing during the fourth quarter to end the year at $51 per barrel. Brent crude oil prices further increased to approximately $60 per barrel at the beginning of February 2021, which is consistent with prices a year ago. In an effort to stabilize oil prices by limiting supply, OPEC and other oil producing allies agreed to substantial production cuts throughout 2020 that were extended through March 2021.
 
While commodity prices can be volatile, the sharp decline throughout 2020 triggered E&P companies to reduce budgets by approximately 25%. Exploration offerings and data purchases are often discretionary and, therefore, receive disproportionately higher reductions than overall budget cuts. Consequently, there has been a material slowdown in offshore seismic spending since the second quarter of 2020, and while we are seeing signs that could improve, we expect the market to remain challenging in 2021. However, the challenging market also serves as a catalyst to drive necessary cost restructuring and digital transformation of the E&P ecosystem.
 
Our management expects continued portfolio rationalization and high grading as E&P companies seek to find the best return on investment opportunities to meet oil and gas demand in the next decade. Near-term, due to the impact of the COVID-19, project high grading will likely be more acute due to budget reductions.  Over the last several years, we strategically shifted our portfolio closer to the reservoir, where revenue tends to be higher and more consistent. New Venture data acquisition offshore and Software and related personnel-based offshore services are expected to continue to be most impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions. While offshore operations have been temporarily impacted by travel restrictions, we believe the demand for digitalization technologies will remain strong. In some cases, ION technology is expected to be more relevant and valuable in the current environment. For instance, ION expects offerings that facilitate remote working to see increased demand.

While 2020 revenues came in lower than the prior year due to the repercussions of the oil price volatility in early 2020 and the ongoing uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic, we made progress executing our strategy. We continue to work closely with our clients to understand their revised plans and to scale our business appropriately. We partially mitigated the impact of the current macroeconomic environment by fully benefiting from the structural changes and associated cost reductions that were outlined in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020. To further mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and oil price volatility, management implemented a plan to preserve cash and manage liquidity as follows:
 

• | Scaled down personnel costs and operating expenses in April 2020 by another $18.0 million during the remaining nine months of 2020, building on the over $20.0 million of cuts made in January 2020. These further reductions are primarily through a variety of furlough programs and reduced compensation arrangements across our worldwide workforce. Our executives took a 20% base salary reduction and a tiered reduction scheme has been cascaded to the rest of the worldwide workforce. Our Board of Directors took a 20% reduction in directors' fees. In addition, we have curtailed use of external contractors, decreased travel and event costs and implemented new systems and processes that more efficiently support our business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced capital expenditures to approximately $28.0 million (a portion of which were pre-funded or underwritten by our customers), down from the original budget of $35.0 million to $50.0 million, to reflect both reduced seismic demand and travel/border restrictions impacting new data acquisition offshore. The majority of capital expenditures relate to investments in multi-client data. This provides flexibility to aggressively reduce cash outflows while shifting to significantly lower cost reimaging programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Applied for and continue to explore various government assistance programs, of which approximately $6.9 million was received and applied against qualifying expenditures during the second quarter. Receipt of this assistance allowed us to avoid further staff reductions while supporting our ongoing operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Re-negotiated existing lease agreements for our significant locations to obtain rent relief of approximately $4.0 million. The majority of the cash savings from the rent relief is from July 2020 to March 2021. See Footnote 14 "Lease Obligations" of Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Announced the sale of our 49% ownership interest in INOVA Geophysical joint venture (defined below in "Our Business") for $12.0 million subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Closing of the transaction is expected in 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Entered into a settlement agreement with WesternGeco L.L.C ("WesternGeco") ending the decade-long patent litigation. See Footnote 9 "Litigations" of Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

We have been a leading technology innovator for over 50 years. While the traditional focus of our technology has been on the E&P industry, we are now broadening and diversifying our business into relevant adjacent markets such as E&P logistics and ports and harbors. Our offerings are focused on improving subsurface knowledge to enhance E&P decision-making and enhancing situational awareness to optimize offshore operations. We serve customers in most major energy producing regions of the world from strategically located offices.
 
The Company is publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker IO. ION is headquartered in Houston, Texas with regional offices around the world. The company has 428 employees, about half of whom are in technical roles and a quarter have advanced degrees. We have approximately 450 patents and pending patent applications in various countries around the world.
 
We provide our services and products through two business segments - E&P Technology & Services and Operations Optimization. In addition, we have a 49% ownership interest in INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited (“INOVA Geophysical,” or “INOVA”), a joint venture with BGP Inc. (“BGP”), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation. BGP owns the remaining 51% equity interest in INOVA. We wrote our investment in INOVA down to zero in 2014. See further discussion below on our agreement to sell our interest in INOVA.
 
Our E&P Technology & Services segment creates digital data assets and delivers services to help E&P companies improve decision-making, reduce risk and maximize value. Across the E&P lifecycle, our E&P offerings focus on driving customer decisions, such as which blocks to bid on and for how much, how to maximize portfolio value, where to drill wells or how to optimize production.
 
Our Operations Optimization segment develops mission-critical subscription offerings and provides engineering services that enable operational control and optimization offshore. This segment is comprised of our Optimization Software & Services and Devices offerings. Our advanced hardware and software offerings control some of the largest moving objects on the planet and in some of the harshest conditions.
 
We historically conducted our land seismic equipment business through INOVA, which manufactures land seismic data acquisition systems, digital sensors, vibroseis vehicles (i.e., vibrator trucks), and energy source controllers. In March 2020, we announced an agreement to sell our 49% ownership interest in INOVA joint venture for $12.0 million, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Closing of the transaction is expected in 2021.

Services and Products
 
E&P Technology & Services. Our offerings are designed to help E&P companies improve decision-making, reduce risk and maximize value. Within our E&P Technology and Services segment, there are two synergistic groups: Imaging and Reservoir Services and Ventures. Our Imaging and Reservoir Services group provides advanced data processing, imaging and reservoir services designed to maximize image quality and subsurface insights, helping E&P companies reduce exploration and production risk, evaluate and develop reservoirs, and increase production. Imaging and Reservoir Services continually develops and applies proprietary processing algorithms via its imaging engine to data owned or licensed by our customers to translate raw data into subsurface images. We continually enhance our novel workflows and maintain a leading-edge infrastructure to efficiently deliver the best image quality.
 
While our Imaging and Reservoir Services group processes and images data for customers on a proprietary basis, the majority of these resources support our higher potential return multi-client business. The proprietary work we take on is complex, where our advanced technology is valued and where we closely collaborate with our customers to solve their toughest challenges. We maintain approximately 19 petabytes of digital seismic data storage through our global data centers, including a core data center located in Houston. We utilize a globally distributed network of Linux-cluster processing centers in combination with our major hubs in Houston and London to process seismic data using advanced, proprietary algorithms and workflows.
 
Our Ventures group leverages the world-class geoscience skills of the Imaging and Reservoir Services group to create global digital data assets that are licensed to multiple E&P companies to optimize their investment decisions. Our global data library consists of over 740,000 km of 2D and over 380,000 sq km of 3D multi-client seismic data in virtually all major offshore petroleum provinces. Ventures has the capability and expertise to manage multi-client or proprietary surveys, from survey planning and design to data acquisition and management, to final subsurface imaging and reservoir characterization. We focus on the technologically intensive components of the image development process, such as survey planning and design, and data processing and interpretation, while outsourcing asset-intensive components (such as field acquisition) to experienced contractors.
 
Occasionally we develop proprietary technology solutions that fill a gap we have identified in the market and support our multi-client program development efforts.  For example, previously we created an under-ice acquisition solution to collect data in the Arctic and Marlin™ was initially developed to help manage our own complex survey operations. In 2020, we commercialized Gemini™ extended frequency source technology. Gemini’s unique design efficiently supports substantially improved data quality and lower environmental impact desired by the industry. This important ingredient to enhancing subsurface knowledge differentiates ION as we expand into the larger 3D multi-client new acquisition market while maintaining our asset light approach. 
 
We offer our services to customers on both a proprietary and multi-client (non-exclusive) basis. In both cases, a majority of our exposure to survey costs are generally pre-funded by our customers, limiting our cost exposure. The period during which our multi-client surveys are being designed, acquired or processed is referred to as the “New Venture” phase. Once the New Venture phase is completed, the surveys become part of our Data Library. For proprietary services, the customer has exclusive ownership of the data. For multi-client surveys, we generally retain ownership of our long-term exclusive marketing rights to the data and receive ongoing revenue from subsequent data license sales.
 
Operations Optimization. Our Operations Optimization segment develops mission-critical subscription offerings and provides engineering services that enable operational control and optimization offshore. Our advanced systems improve situational awareness, communication and risk management to enable rapid, informed decisions in challenging offshore environments. Our industry-leading mission management, navigation, communications and sensing technologies enable safer, more efficient operations.
 
This segment is comprised of our Optimization Software & Services and Devices offerings. 
 
Our Optimization Software & Services group provides survey design, command and control software systems and related services for marine towed streamer and seabed operations. Our software business commands recurring, premium subscription revenues. We are market leaders in our core business and adapted our platform to more broadly optimize operations beyond our core market. Our software offerings leverage a leading data integration platform to control and optimize operations. Engineering services experts deliver in-field optimization services, equipment maintenance and training to maximize value from our offerings.
 
    6 

  

We extended our successful seismic command and control platform to optimize operations more broadly. Marlin is cloud-based software designed to maximize the safety and efficiency of complex offshore operations by integrating a variety of data sources in real-time with operational plans to improve situational awareness and decision-making. Akin to air traffic control systems, Marlin enables multiple stakeholders to share and visualize vessel route plans, foresee and avoid conflicts between vessels and fixed assets, optimize schedules safely within a rules-based environment, and measure and improve asset performance.
 
Our Devices group develops intelligent equipment controlled by our software to optimize operations. Our Devices group develops, manufactures and repairs marine data acquisition systems, diverters, sensors and compasses, which, in addition to seismic, have been deployed in marine robotics, scientific, E&P, defense and other commercial applications.
 
INOVA Geophysical. INOVA manufactures land acquisition systems, land source products and source controllers and multicomponent sensors. We wrote our investment in INOVA down to zero in 2014.
 
ION History
 
Founded in 1968 as Input/Output (“I/O”), ION began as a provider of highly specialized seismic source synchronization equipment. In 1988, the company introduced its first land system, System One, capable of recording large volumes of data more quickly, which helped the industry shift from 2D to 3D data. ION became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange in 1991, and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994 using the trading symbol "IO". Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, ION experienced growth through a number of acquisitions. In 2002, the company’s first BasinSPAN multi-client program was introduced, paving the way for a global data library. In September 2007, Input/Output officially changed its name to "ION" as part of a re-branding to better reflect the continuing evolution of the company from an equipment manufacturer to a broad-based, technology-focused seismic solutions provider.
 
E&P Subsurface Data Collection and Use
 
Since the 1930s, oil and gas companies have sought to reduce exploration risk by using seismic data to create an image of the Earth’s subsurface. Seismic imaging plays a fundamental role in hydrocarbon exploration and reservoir development by delineating structures, rock types and fluid locations in the subsurface. Our technologies, services and solutions are used by E&P companies to generate high-resolution images of the Earth’s subsurface to identify hydrocarbons, pinpoint drilling locations and monitor production from existing wells.
 
Typically, an E&P company engages the services of a geophysical acquisition contractor to develop a seismic survey design, secure permits, coordinate logistics, and acquire seismic data in a selected area. E&P companies generally rely on third parties, such as ION, to provide the contractor with equipment, navigation and data management software, and field support services necessary for data acquisition. After the data is collected, the same geophysical contractor, a third-party data processing company, or the E&P company itself will process the data using proprietary algorithms and workflows to create a series of seismic images. Geoscientists then interpret the data by reviewing the images of the subsurface and integrating the geophysical data with other geological and production information such as well logs or core information.
 
Seismic data is collected when recording devices placed on the Earth’s surface, sea floor, or carried within the streamer cable of a towed streamer vessel, measure how long it takes for sound vibrations to echo off rock layers underground. For seismic data acquisition onshore, the acoustic energy producing the sound vibrations is generated by large vibroseis (vibrator) vehicles. In marine acquisition, the energy is provided by source arrays that deliver compressed air into the water column. The acoustic energy propagates through the subsurface as a spherical wave front, or seismic wave. Interfaces between different types of rocks will both reflect and transmit this wave front. Onshore, the reflected signals return to the surface where they are measured by sensitive receivers called analog coil-spring geophones. Offshore, the reflected signals are recorded by either hydrophones towed in an array behind a streamer acquisition vessel or by multicomponent geophones or micro electromechanical system sensors that are placed directly on the ocean floor. Once the recorded seismic energy is processed using advanced algorithms and workflows, images of the subsurface can be created to depict the structure, lithology (rock type), fracture patterns, and fluid content of subsurface horizons, highlighting the most promising places to drill for oil and natural gas. This processing also aids in engineering decisions, such as drilling and completion methods, as well as decisions affecting reservoir production and economic decisions related to infrastructure and reserves in place.

Markets and Customers
 
Oil and gas prices have rebounded, however, we expect the market to remain challenging in the near-term. E&P companies' focus on value generation and cash preservation continues to affect exploration spending. We are diversifying our revenues in other markets to help mitigate the impact of oil and gas cycles. Our primary customers are E&P companies to whom we market and offer services, primarily multi-client seismic data programs from our Ventures group, data processing, imaging and reservoir services from our Imaging and Reservoir Services group, as well as consulting services from our Optimization Software & Services group. In 2020, E&P companies accounted for approximately 78% of our total consolidated net revenues. Secondarily, seismic contractors purchase our towed streamer data acquisition systems and related equipment and software to collect data in accordance with their E&P company customers’ specifications or for their own seismic data libraries.
 
We are actively diversifying our software and hardware into adjacent markets, primarily focused on ports and harbors. Ports and harbors are undergoing a digital transformation that is fundamentally changing operations and increasing efficiency. Tier 1 ports have been leading the digital transformation, and there's an emerging need for Tier 2 and Tier 3 ports to do so as well to compete. New disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and Blockchain have the potential to transform port efficiency.
 
A significant portion of our marketing effort is focused on areas outside of the United States. Foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of political instability, armed conflict, civil disturbances, currency fluctuations, embargo and governmental activities, customer credit risks and risk of non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, including tariff regulations and import/export restrictions.
 
We sell our services and products through a direct sales force consisting of employees and international third-party sales representatives responsible for key geographic areas. The majority of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, sales to destinations outside of North America accounted for approximately 92%, 84% and 89% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. Further, systems and equipment sold to domestic customers is frequently deployed internationally and, from time to time, certain foreign sales require export licenses.
 
Traditionally, our business has been seasonal, with strongest demand typically in the second half of our fiscal year.
 
For information concerning the geographic breakdown of our consolidated net revenues, see Footnote 3 “Segment and Geographic Information of Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
 
Competition
 
The market for seismic services and products is highly competitive and characterized by frequent changes in technology.
 
Our Ventures group within our E&P Technology & Services segment faces competition in creating, developing and selling multi-client data from a number of companies. CGG (an integrated geophysical company), Schlumberger (a large integrated oilfield services company) and TGS all have an asset light strategy. Shearwater, Polarcus and BGP run acquisition crews and also compete in multi-client data acquisition. PGS is the only integrated provider delivering both.
 
Our Imaging and Reservoir Services group within our E&P Technology & Services segment competes with companies that provide data processing services to E&P companies. See “Services and Products - E&P Technology & Services Segment.” While the barriers to enter this market are relatively low, we believe the barriers to compete at the higher end of the market where our efforts are focused - are significantly higher. At the higher end of this market, CGG and Schlumberger are our two primary competitors for advanced imaging and reservoir services. Both of these companies are significantly larger than ION in terms of revenue, processing locations and sales, marketing and financial resources.
 
Our principal competitor for marine equipment is Sercel, a manufacturing subsidiary of CGG. We also compete with other equipment companies on a product-by-product basis. Our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic instruments and data acquisition systems depends principally upon continued technological innovation, as well as pricing, system reliability, reputation for quality and ability to deliver on schedule.
 
Some service providers design and manufacture acquisition technology in-house (or through a network of third-party vendors) to differentiate themselves. Although this technology competes directly with ours, it is not usually made available to other seismic acquisition contractors.
 
In the land seismic equipment market, where INOVA competes, the principal competitors are Sercel and Geospace Technologies. INOVA is a joint venture with BGP as a majority stake owner. BGP purchases land seismic equipment from both INOVA and competing land equipment suppliers.
 
Outside of our core market, we compete with a number of software and hardware technology companies. The market for ports and harbors technologies tends to be very fragmented with a range of huge multi-billion dollar competitors to new startups. The closest competitor to Marlin in ports and harbors is PortMaster, software developed by the Port of Rotterdam.

Our Strategy
 
The key elements of our business strategy are to:
 

• | Leverage our technologies to create value through data capture, analysis and optimization to enhance companies’ critical decision-making abilities and returns. Data, analytics and digitalization provide a step-change opportunity to translate information into insights to enhance decisions, gain a competitive edge and deliver superior returns. As a result, decision-making is shifting from what was historically an art to a science. ION offerings are focused on improving E&P decision-making and optimizing offshore operations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our E&P Technology & Services business, focusing on delivering value closer to the reservoir. Over the last several years, we have made an effort to diversify our offerings within the E&P life cycle and move closer to the reservoir. Historically known for our 2D programs, we initially materially entered the 3D multi-client market by reimaging existing seismic data using our advanced data processing techniques and algorithms. We rapidly grew our data library in Mexico and Brazil, making a name for ourselves in 3D. Building on this success, in 2020 we set our sights on entering the larger 3D multi-client new acquisition market. Our Gemini source and top tier imaging are key ingredients to successfully executing this strategy. We believe shifting to more reservoir-focused E&P offerings will increase earnings and position our company better for E&P cycles. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our Operations Optimization business into relevant adjacent markets. While our traditional focus for technology has been on the seismic industry, we are broadening and diversifying our software and equipment businesses into relevant adjacent markets such as E&P logistics and ports and harbors. Adjacent markets broaden our opportunity to better monetize our return on technology investments while reducing our susceptibility to E&P cycles. We intend to grow our revenues from these non-seismic markets over the next 5 years. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue investing in advanced software and equipment technology to provide next generation services and products. Our industry is competitive and continually evolving, so we intend to continue investing in the development of new technologies to stay on the cutting-edge of innovation. A key element of our business strategy has been to understand the challenges faced in survey planning, data acquisition, processing, and interpretation and offshore operations. We will continue to develop and offer technology and services that enable us to work with clients to solve their unique challenges around the world. In particular, we intend to focus on the development of our Gemini extended frequency source, our Marlin operations optimization software, and continued advancement of our data processing and imaging workflows, such as FWI, with the goal of obtaining technical and market leadership in what we continue to believe are important and expanding markets. In 2020, our total investment in research and development and engineering was equal to approximately 11% of our total consolidated net revenues for the year.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strengths
 
We believe that we are solidly positioned to successfully execute the key elements of our business strategy based on the following competitive strengths:
 

• | We develop and leverage innovative technology platforms to improve decision-making and profitability. Our data management and analysis platforms help derive insights from data we acquire to improve E&P decision-making and optimize offshore operations. The data can be used to decide whether and how much to bid on a block, how to maximize production from a field, or how to optimize the safety and efficiency of complex maritime projects. Our operations optimization platform and imaging engine are the core underlying technology and we continually advance our complex algorithms to improve the resulting analysis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We focus on higher potential return offerings and creative business models to maximize shareholder value. We streamlined our business and focused on the areas with the highest potential returns because we believe every dollar invested should go further. In addition, we aim to structure both the project financing and payment in a way to maximize profit, such as sharing in the success of a project.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our asset light strategy enables us to avoid significant fixed costs and remain financially flexible. We do not own a fleet of marine vessels and do not provide our own crews to acquire seismic data. We outsource seismic data acquisition activity to third parties that operate fleets of seismic vessels and equipment. This practice enables us to avoid significant fixed costs associated with these assets and personnel and to manage our business in a manner that provides flexibility to quickly scale up or down our capital investments based on E&P spending levels. We actively manage the costs of developing our multi-client data business by having our customers partially pre-fund, or underwrite, the investment for any new project. Our target goal is to have a vast majority of the total cost of each new project’s data acquisition to be underwritten by our customers. We believe this conservative approach to multi-client data investment is the most prudent way to reduce the impact of any sudden reduction in the demand for seismic data, giving us the flexibility to aggressively reduce cash outflows as we have successfully implemented in the current industry downturn.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our global footprint and diversified portfolio approach enable us to offset regional downturns or local slowdowns. Conducting business around the world has been and will continue to be a key component of our strategy. This global focus and diversified portfolio approach have been helpful in minimizing the impact of any regional or country-specific slowdown for short or extended periods of time. While the traditional focus of our technology has been on the seismic industry, we are now broadening and diversifying our business into relevant adjacent markets such as E&P logistics and ports and harbors. Adjacent markets broaden our opportunity to better monetize our return on technology investments while reducing our susceptibility to E&P cycles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a diversified and blue chip customer base. We provide services and products to a diverse, global customer base that includes many of the largest oil and gas and geophysical companies in the world, including National Oil Companies (“NOCs”) and International Oil Companies (“IOCs”). Whereas almost all of our revenues in the early 2000s were derived from seismic service providers, in 2020, E&P companies accounted for approximately 78% of our total consolidated net revenues.

Product Research and Development
 
Our ability to compete effectively depends principally upon continued innovation in our underlying technologies and the value we can provide to inform decisions. As such, the overall focus of our research and development efforts has remained on improving the quality and value of the data we provide and the subsurface images we generate. In particular, we have concentrated on enhancing the quality of the information that can be extracted from the subsurface images. Research and development efforts in 2020 targeted a range of new technologies.
 
The Ventures group commercialized new Gemini extended frequency source technology to improve subsurface imaging and environmental performance.
 
The Imaging and Reservoir Services group continued to enhance its high-end workflows, such as FWI, and invest in infrastructure to efficiently deliver Tier 1 image quality.
 
The Optimization Software & Services group continues enhancing core survey design and command and control software while broadening Marlin’s capabilities for adjacent markets, primarily for ports and harbors.
 
Development within the Devices group was focused on new technologies for adjacent markets and sustaining our existing portfolio of technologies. We continue to invest in the development of new sensors within and outside our core business. 
 
As many of these new services and products are under development and, as the development cycles from initial conception to commercial introduction can extend over a number of years, their commercial feasibility or degree of commercial acceptance may not yet be established. No assurance can be given concerning the successful development of any new service or product, any enhancements to them, the specific timing of their release or their level of acceptance in the marketplace.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies. We have approximately 450 patents and pending patent applications, including filings in international jurisdictions with respect to the same kinds of technologies. Although our portfolio of patents is important to our operations, and particular patents may be material to specific business lines, no one patent is considered essential to our consolidated business operations.
 
Our patents, copyrights and trademarks offer us only limited protection. Our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, or may design around the proprietary features of our products. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult, and we may be unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs. Our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the United States, including the potential for adverse decisions by judicial or administrative bodies in foreign countries with unpredictable or corrupt judicial systems. From time to time, third parties inquire and claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights and we make similar inquiries and claims to third parties. Material intellectual property litigation is discussed in detail in Footnote 9 “Litigations” of Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Regulatory Matters
 
Our operations are subject to various international conventions, laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the importation of and operation of seismic equipment, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel, environmental protection, the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of equipment. Our operations are subject to government policies and product certification requirements worldwide. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating the companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and gas companies and may continue to do so. Operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems that are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings (including the potential for adverse decisions by judicial or administrative bodies in foreign countries with unpredictable or corrupt judicial systems). We are required to consent to home country jurisdiction in many of our contracts with foreign state-owned companies, particularly those countries where our data are acquired.
 
Changes in these conventions, regulations, policies or requirements could affect the demand for our services and products or result in the need to modify them, which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. Our export activities are subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations. Certain countries are subject to trade restrictions, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. government. These restrictions and sanctions prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries.
 
Our operations are also subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials, the remediation of contaminated properties and the protection of the environment. While the industry has experienced an increase in general environmental regulation worldwide and laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent, we do not believe compliance with these regulations has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations, and we do not currently foresee the need for significant expenditures in order to be able to remain compliant in all material respects with current environmental protection laws. Regulations in this area are subject to change, and there can be no assurance that future laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
 
On January 20, 2021, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior issued an order, effective immediately, mandating a 60-day moratorium on new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on federal lands and waters, and more recently President Biden recently announced a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. Our global footprint and diversified portfolio approach helps minimize the impact of any regional or country-specific slowdown. We are primarily focused internationally offshore, and unlike our peers, we have a fairly modest exposure to the Gulf of Mexico. Our 2D data library in the Gulf of Mexico is a mature, exploration-focused offering that is already very well subscribed by incumbent block holders. The 3D data library we have onshore North America covers private, not public, acreage. Should the moratorium result in longer-term changes, this could drive large scale E&P company portfolio investment more towards international offshore, which would be better aligned with our offerings.
 
President Biden and the Democratic Party, which now controls Congress, have identified climate change as a priority, and it is likely that new executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting, delaying or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated during the Biden Administration. A recent executive order issued by President Biden established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration, affirmed that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority, affirmed the Biden Administration’s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change, generally further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies’ decision-making, and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures.
 
To the extent that our customers’ operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Governments and regulatory agencies in the European Union, the United States and other regions, as well as the public, have been increasingly focused on curtailing the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and on ameliorating their effect on the climate.  There are many proposals at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases, and these proposals will likely continue to proliferate. One such proposal is the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. The United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement under the Trump Administration, but Biden recommitted the United States to it upon assuming office. 
 
There have also been efforts in recent years to encourage sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities, and other investors to avoid investments in companies involved in hydrocarbon exploration and production, and to encourage lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with them. These activities could have a material adverse effect on our share price, on our ability to secure financing, and on our ability to generate revenue. 
 
We could also face climate‐related litigation with respect to our operations or products. A number of cities, local governments and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against companies involved in hydrocarbon exploration and production, alleging, among other things, that such companies contribute to climate change, or that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. While we are not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Employees
 
We pride ourselves on providing a diverse, inclusive culture; challenging, rewarding work; technical training and career development programs. In light of COVID-19, we are also providing flexibility where to possible to enable remote working and flexible hours.
 
ION has a strong organizational culture built on five principles that we believe will enable us deliver the best results for our clients and shareholders. The cultural pillars include themes of entrepreneurialism, accountability, collaboration, customer-centricity, and innovation. 
 
As an organization with diverse employees, ION is committed to supporting and advancing our ‘One ION’ culture that deeply values and respects diversity and inclusion. In 2020, ION established a diversity and inclusion policy and advocacy group to further strengthen this mission. We have worked to increase the diversity of our Board of Directors, leadership team and overall workforce in the last couple of years. We also take measures to ensure equity, such as providing employees equal access to opportunities, such as equity in pay, and recruiting strategies aimed at hiring diverse talent.
 
Historically we have maintained a healthy employee retention rate, which for 2020 was 92%. In addition, the average tenure of our active employees is 12 years, a key determinant of overall employment satisfaction. 
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 428 regular, full-time employees, 56% of whom were located in the U.S. From time to time and on an as-needed basis, we supplement our regular workforce with individuals that we hire temporarily or retain as independent contractors in order to most effectively achieve our business objectives. Our U.S. employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
