ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We started Metromile based on the simple observation that the physical world is being increasingly digitized, that this digital data can be used to better estimate the future, and that the best opportunity to create value for everyday customers in an increasingly predictable world is to reinvent insurance, one of the largest and most important global markets.
 
At its core, insurance financially protects the insured customer from the occurrence of specific future events. If these events can be more accurately estimated, using data and data science, then the insurance provided can be more accurately priced — lower likelihood events would cause the price of insurance to go down and higher likelihood events would cause the price of insurance to go up. The proliferation of sensor data, from cars, mobile phones, and elsewhere, means we have a greater ability to estimate the likelihood of future events and, thus, help many customers who are overpaying for insurance save money.
 
We founded Metromile in 2011 to realize this opportunity and tackle the broken auto insurance industry. With data science as our foundation, we offer our insurance customers real time, personalized auto insurance policies, priced and billed by the mile, with rates based on precisely how and how much they actually drive, instead of using the industry standard approximations and estimates that make prices unfair for most customers.
 
Through our digitally native offering, built around the needs of the modern driver, we believe our per-mile insurance policies save our customers, on average, 47% over what they were paying their previous auto insurer. We base this belief on data our customers self-reported in 2018 with respect to premiums paid to providers before switching to Metromile.
 
We believe the opportunity for our personalized per-mile insurance product is significant. Federal Highway Administration data indicates that approximately 35% of drivers drive more than half the total miles driven. We believe there is a correlation between the number of miles driven and the number of insurable losses. An October 2016 report by the Insurance Information Institute noted that the increase in claims frequency appears directly linked to the increase in the number of miles driven. Notwithstanding the relationship between miles driven and claims, auto insurance premiums have historically been priced based on a driver’s “class” — and drivers are charged the same basic premium rate as others in their class no matter the actual miles driven. In the traditional pricing model, a driver’s age, credit score, accident history, and geography influences the premium paid more than the actual miles driven. Thus, the 35% of drivers who account for more than half the miles driven are not paying premiums based on how often they are behind the wheel and increasing the potential for an insurable loss claim. We believe the traditional pricing model is inherently unfair to the majority of drivers — the 65% of drivers who drive less than half the miles driven — as they are effectively subsidizing the minority of drivers who are high-mileage drivers. By offering auto insurance using a per-mile rate and then billing each customer monthly based on their actual miles driven, we are able to provide significant savings to the vast majority of drivers, the 65% of drivers who drive less than half the miles driven. Customers can simply use their connected car or use a Metromile Pulse device, or The Pulse, to share their data with us — which includes miles driven, and in certain states where permitted by insurance regulators, driving habits, such as phone use, speeding, hard-braking, accelerating, cornering, and location. Our customers are able to choose when and how to drive and share this information with us to realize these data driven savings every day. See “— Our Technology Platform” for more information regarding The Pulse and data collection.
 
Our offering is also more appealing to the modern digital consumer beyond just the savings we offer. Customers sign up, access customer support, and file claims entirely through our mobile app. Claims are handled quickly and, in many cases, are fully automated. Our proprietary technology underpins these unique capabilities. We are built using data science at our core — we know how to acquire and unlock the predictive value of the data generated by the car, mobile phones, and elsewhere. This translates into a better experience, higher customer retention rates, lower cost of customer acquisition, less fraud, less servicing expense, and greater operating profits.

Our core technology capabilities have also unlocked a powerful new business for us — Metromile Enterprise, a cloud-based enterprise software solution for insurance carriers that provides them advanced claims automation and fraud detection tools, improving their operating margins, while earning us a share of their insurance premium as a service fee. With Metromile Enterprise already in market, we have started to realize returns on our earlier technology investments and expect to see this business help the large incumbents in the insurance industry transition into a more digital world, while helping us quickly grow our earnings.
 
Today, we consider ourselves a leading digital insurance platform, providing unique and advantaged products to auto insurance customers in the United States and auto insurance companies in the United States and globally.
 
The U.S. auto insurance market is massive, dominated by insurers stuck on legacy technology infrastructure who offer antiquated services. U.S. personal auto insurers write approximately $250.0 billion of premiums each year, with no carrier currently achieving more than 20% market share. We believe we are strategically positioned to succeed as industry incumbents struggle to meet the significant structural changes underway in an increasingly digital world. The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized modern mobility, while connected and autonomous technologies are drastically changing consumer relationships with vehicles. As we scale and accumulate more data, we believe that we can deliver increasingly better service, pricing and experiences for customers across all stages of the policy lifecycle.
 

Through our core competencies in technology and operating as a full-stack insurance carrier, we are already achieving durable margin advantages that we believe will allow us to maintain a competitive edge in pricing and generate incremental cash to invest in future growth for the years and decades ahead. We believe our focus on technology will allow us to gain efficiencies through automation and the ability to scale.
 
We believe our customers are loyal. We measure this, in part, by our overall net promoter score, or NPS, of 56 as of end of year 2020. The NPS metric is a management tool used to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty and indicates the percentage of customers rating their likelihood to recommend a product or service to a friend or colleague. After 51 days of joining Metromile, we ask each new customer the likelihood that they will recommend Metromile to a friend or colleague on a scale of 0 to 10. Scores between 0-6 are considered detractors and scores between 9-10 are considered promoters. To arrive at Metromile’s NPS score in a given month, the percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters. Scores between 7-8 are considered passive and are counted toward the total number of respondents, thus decreasing the percentage of detractors and promoters and pushing the net score toward 0. By recommending our services to their friends and family, we believe our customers demonstrate their satisfaction and loyalty to our services. In addition to NPS, we believe that customer referrals also demonstrate customer loyalty. One out of four customers with our Ride Along app recommends our app to a friend or colleague, yielding a 25% referral rate. We believe our overall NPS of 56, along with our 25% referral rate through the Ride Along app, demonstrate our customer satisfaction and loyalty to Metromile.

We have trained our predictive models to deliver what we believe is one of the most sophisticated pricing engines in the industry using the approximately three billion miles of customer driving data we have collected since our founding. Our data-driven approach is designed to improve the accuracy of risk-profiling customers while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of fraud and losses.
 
We built these models in the early days by carefully selecting our first markets, acquiring data and quickly iterating on our proprietary rating and underwriting models, building out our own customer service and claims functions, and reinventing as we gained new data and experience.
 
As our models have matured, we have also learned how to more efficiently and effectively acquire customers, as these models can also be applied to estimate the lifetime profitability of any potential new customer lead based on key indicators. We migrated from marketing in well-defined offline channels to using a variety of more cost-effective digital solutions for our customer funnel, where we can tailor ad targeting, content, and a quote funnel to each individual prospect.
 
We leverage a diverse mix of channel strategies to optimize our marketing efforts including search, display, and social marketing, as well as app acquisition, aggregators (like compare.com, The Zebra, and Everquote), our free app Ride Along (akin to a try before you buy experience) and key automotive original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, partnerships. Our experience and financial profile equip us to excel in our next phase of growth across the United States.
 
We have an exciting and ambitious growth plan that we believe will help us quickly scale nationally. Our disciplined marketing strategy allows us to understand unit economics in each state before investing too far ahead of returns. Prior to initiating rapid growth in a state, we develop our rating and underwriting models, and introduce rates into the market with low marketing spend for the first few quarters as we test and measure key performance indicators. This introductory period allows us to refine our model and underwrite policies with an aim of achieving profitable growth. Once we obtain sufficient data and proof points, we accelerate marketing spend and quickly scale.
 
To further support our insurance customer growth, we are expanding our distribution network by partnering with leading automotive OEMs to identify low-mileage drivers. Our two existing partners are among the world’s top ten biggest car manufacturers, and we aim to partner with at least eight OEMs by 2022. These partners will be able to identify a low-mileage driver 30 days after they purchase a car and offer personalized co-branded marketing to those customers, highlighting their savings and driving a significant number of new customers to Metromile. We believe this exciting channel could generate millions of leads for us in the future with a low new customer acquisition cost.
 
Metromile Enterprise provides additional upside in the near-term. With four active deployments and a full pipeline, this software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business is expected to become a meaningful contributor to revenue and operating profits over the years ahead. Each customer typically signs a multi-year agreement with significant prepaid revenue and service fees, allowing the business to fund its development and growth with customer capital.
 
We believe we have put together one of the best leadership teams in our industry who have significant experience with top technology and insurance companies. They will help us execute our ambitious growth plans through our unique approach to insurance. We believe that we have a truly differentiated value proposition that puts customers in the driver’s seat. Through data science, we have built an impactful business that we believe will help transform the insurance industry.
 
Our Technology Platform
 
Our proprietary technology platform is a key competitive advantage. Through the collection of high frequency telematics data, we have developed a platform capable of understanding moment-by-moment driving behavior. Using data science and machine learning, we build predictive models to accurately determine the risk profiles of our customers and offer fairer, more accurate pricing.

Our customer-friendly, intuitive interface paired with The Pulse creates a seamless user experience. The Pulse device easily plugs into the diagnostic port of our customer’s car and transmits data over wireless cellular networks. The Pulse device provides visibility into customer braking behavior at each intersection, miles driven, speed, acceleration, hard-braking, cornering, and location. In addition, through our OEM partnerships, we will be able to connect directly with vehicles and stream the same sensor data without a device. The more data we collect, the better our predictive models will become, allowing us to enhance our unit economics and value to consumers.
 
The moment of truth for all insurers is when a customer submits a claim. In a traditional experience, a customer is required to go through many hurdles simply to get their car repaired after an accident, causing customer frustration. The fundamental cause of this high friction experience is that up to 17% of claims are fraudulent and insurers are forced to implement onerous processes and look at every claim with suspicion, where trust is eroded with the customer. Alternatively, our platform is capable of algorithmically reconstructing the accident scene and letting the majority of drivers have the claim nearly instantly approved. We create loyal customers by helping them get back on the road quickly and seamlessly.
 
We have been able to identify and reduce fraudulent claims by three times the rate of our industry peers. The structural costs associated with high fraud rates in the auto insurance industry are ultimately passed on to consumers. Our fraud detection advantage ultimately improves our loss ratio, which allows us to keep our costs lower and pass on additional savings to our customers.
 
The net result of our technology advantage is a fundamentally lower cost structure. Because premiums charged to the consumer ultimately reflect the underlying costs of the insurance business and its losses, we have developed a competitive advantage beyond our pricing model. Built from the ground-up with technology and sensors first, we have developed a durable competitive advantage with a highly efficient and streamlined operation, which we believe will yield higher returns to stockholders for years to come.
 
The Metromile app
 
From the outset, we believed the experience with an auto insurer should go beyond being a compulsory purchase, selected based solely on price. With our app, our customers benefit from rich functionality, tools, and features. Prospects are able to sign up within minutes or try Ride Along to estimate and earn more savings. Aligned with our first value of creating loyal customers, we aim to stay engaged with our customers every step of the way.

Our app increases engagement and improves our relationship with customers by providing helpful features such as street sweeping notifications to help avoid parking tickets, get walking directions to their car, and monitor their car health. Everything needed to manage a policy can be done in the app, such as viewing policy information and documents, auto insurance ID cards, monthly billing summaries, and detailed trip maps. With an always-connected vehicle, we have a 92% stolen car recovery rate.
 
Ride Along
 
We launched Ride Along to help prospects understand if they are a fit for per-mile, and to provide additional savings to prospects by demonstrating that they are also safe drivers.
 
The significance of this specific technology offering also lends itself to the future growth potential of our company. The Ride Along feature serves not only as a platform to provide driving insights to customers but also as a customer acquisition source, by helping estimate savings and allowing prospects to earn additional discounts through safe driving.
 
Our Ride Along app enables viral growth as evidenced by a 20% conversion rate for prospects who use the app, a 25% referral rate to new customers, and the fact that 11% of abandoned quoters try Ride Along, all since it was launched in the second quarter of 2020.
 
Metromile Enterprise
 
Metromile Enterprise is a cloud-based enterprise software offering for third party insurance carriers that was built on top of our sophisticated automated claims technology. The service helps carriers automate the claims processes for both customers and claims agents while reducing the cost of fraudulent claims through advanced fraud detection features. The service works cooperatively with existing property and casualty, or P&C, insurance enterprise software platforms and is priced based on a percentage of the insurance premium the service is used to help manage.
 
Our automation and fraud detection capabilities have allowed Metromile’s auto insurance claims program to detect three times more fraud than the industry average, benefiting our loss ratio, while reducing our loss adjustment expense ratio by an estimated 20% due to advanced automation. We saw an opportunity in applying these capabilities to help the broader P&C insurance industry transform and better manage their claims processes and are excited by the progress we’ve made since launching Metromile Enterprise in 2019.
 
Metromile Enterprise is not just for telematics-based auto insurance programs — the software helps global P&C insurers improve customer experience and reduce claim costs across a variety of use cases in auto, home, renters, pet, workers compensation and other specialized P&C insurance programs.
 
This unique growing business allows us to diversify our revenue base into recurring, high-margin enterprise SaaS revenue, while actively participating in the digital transformation underway in the broader insurance markets, with minimal incremental cost. We expect continued growth from this business segment as we continue to sign and launch new deployments with carriers globally and other specialized P&C insurance. This proprietary growth engine will allow us to diversify our revenue base into recurring, high-margin enterprise SaaS revenues. We expect continued growth from our Metromile Enterprise business as we continue to scale more holistically.

With respect to the platform’s specific feature set, our Metromile Enterprise offering consists of Report, Detect, Replay, and Streamline modules.
 


Report
 
The secret to success with predictive models lies in gathering rich, reliably structured data at first notice of loss, or FNOL. The Report module is a smart digital FNOL solution for customer-facing data collection and call center representatives that creates opportunities for improved fraud detection, efficient downstream processing, and a “no-touch” claims experience.
Detect
 
Our Detect module is an artificial intelligence, or AI, powered fraud detection tool trained to scan incoming claims in seconds and build a feedback loop with existing investigative experts. We help capture more fraud and cut costs by eliminating investigations on low probability claims.
Portal
 
The Portal enables insurance carriers to offer their insureds a one-stop digital destination for filing claims, tracking updates on claims in progress and taking action on pending items. This solution helps improve claim handling efficiency and save claim adjuster time.

Replay
 
Replay is a software solution that ingests various types of telematics data and makes it easy to play back a trip to corroborate the reported facts of loss with hard data. The solution helps cut investigation costs and increases confidence in payout decisions.
Streamline
 
Streamline is a powered automation suite, enabled by sophisticated data science modeling, that reduces repetitive tasks done by claims handlers so that they can spend more time providing service for customers with more complex needs. The Streamline solution enables claims self-servicing to settle claims with efficiency.
 
Our platform architecture
 
We believe our platform provides us with a true competitive advantage. We built our technology from the ground-up with the secular shifts in insurance in mind. Our platform is built on a number of foundational architecture principles.
 
We are able to deliver a flexible and scalable platform where customer services can be added and evolved over time.
 
Through delivering micro-services, we ensure a constant evolution of the technology platform, both in terms of features supported as well as technology used. Micro-services also allow efficient scaling of the engineering organization, as it allows an ever-growing number of teams to work in parallel with the least dependency bottlenecks.
 
Our unified user interface is technology-agnostic and built on a back-end service that can enable a diverse range of clients.
 
This allows us to remain agnostic to mobile and web applications along with third-party integrations. We have the flexibility to isolate part of or all of our platform features for third-party integration both directly into a user experience and into the backend of a given platform. This provides us the opportunity to service different enterprises with different technology platforms.
 
Our offerings were created with the core ideas of resiliency and durability in mind to allow for uninterrupted scale.
 
All services are built to enable a distributed and horizontal scaling deployment. This not only supports our scalability but also provides resilience as distributed service instances can survive fault tolerances of individual instances or full zone fails.
 
We heavily leverage machine learning to underpin our business. From personalized pricing through to claims, our technology stack is critical to our success.
 
Industry and market opportunity
 
The U.S. auto insurance market is massive, fragmented, and ripe for disruption as pricing and risk identification remain key components to drive competitive demand. Additionally, shifting consumer preferences toward an online environment creates opportunity for new entrants with a focus on customer experience.
 

● | Massive market: In 2019, the U.S. personal auto insurance market generated in excess of $250 billion in premiums.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly fragmented: Market share in the United States is fragmented with no carrier holding more than 20% market share. Additionally, 111 carriers generated greater than $100.0 million in premiums in 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Ripe for disruption: The auto insurance placement and claims process suffers from poor overall consumer experience, which is attributable to opaque and tiered pricing, lengthy sign-up processes, and arduous claims processes that are often long and repetitive. Additionally, traditional insurance carriers do not consider technology-driven developments to the auto industry when pricing risk. With a developing driver model including autonomous features and new means of transportation, additional factors need to be considered.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Limited use of technology: The insurance market has typically relied on a number of factors to provide pricing and risk assessment information. Statistics like age, credit score, accident history, and geography have often been deciding factors that categorize drivers into buckets and price them accordingly. Technological developments and data science provide new applications to better understand individual driver risk, such as actual miles driven and driving behaviors, and are able to adjust pricing models to consider these variable factors. While other auto insurance providers consider an individual’s prior accident history, we believe Metromile is distinguished by further adjusting to real-time driving behavior. This real-time capture, we believe, allows Metromile to better understand each driver’s risk in ways that backward-looking algorithms, such as “good-driver rewards,” are unable to.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | COVID-19 pandemic: Although the ultimate impacts of COVID-19 remain uncertain and consumer demand for auto insurance may be impacted in a recessionary or stationary environment, a recent survey published by Capgemini SE found that 44% of U.S. adults surveyed plan to use their cars more often and public transportation less often in the future. Further, the dramatic decline in miles driven during the second quarter of 2020 and the fact that legacy carriers were forced to react through ad hoc refund and rebate programs and were sued in class action lawsuits proves that the existing fixed priced insurance model is outdated.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Metromile is well positioned to capitalize on these tailwinds by providing a product that solves fundamental issues with auto insurance and fairly prices policies to individual drivers. This is driven by Metromile’s view that auto insurance today is unfair to most consumers, as insureds are broadly categorized into the same buckets and charged similar rates while still holding varying driving habits and vehicular uses. The distinction between this broad classification and a more technology and data driven approach to assessing risk underpins Metromile’s vision to change how insureds are assessed and charged.
 
Several areas within the personal lines auto space are most significant to understanding this unique market opportunity. The first and most important is regarding the traditional insurance model where insurance products are built for a “class of driver” rather than individual insureds. This foundational concept of pricing risk gained traction in the 1990s when carriers discovered independent factors such as credit score were good indicators of an individual’s driving habits and risk classification. Using additional rating variables like credit expanded segmentation via proxy and moved the industry further away from evaluating individual risk. The widespread use of such factors became industry norm where the process of receiving an insurance quote is dictated by several key factors that place customers into classes associated with varying risk levels and premium payments. While still broadly used today, this results in a significant bifurcation of insureds within each class level where drivers that have the same gender, geographic location, vehicle make, accident history, and credit score receive similar quotes. Other factors, however, still vary between two similar applications, the most significant and quantifiable being miles driven. This creates a pricing imbalance where a small portion of drivers within a class create significant liabilities because of their frequent driving habits. Drivers who infrequently use their vehicles therefore are subsidizing the higher risk of their peers by paying similar rates while having fundamentally different risk profiles. We believe this results in approximately 65% of drivers overpaying for personal auto insurance and 35% of drivers underpaying, as the Federal Highway Administration data indicates that approximately 35% of drivers drive more than half the total miles driven. We believe there is a correlation between the number of miles driven and the number of insurable losses. An October 2016 report by the Insurance Information Institute noted that the increase in claims frequency appears directly linked to the increase in the number of miles driven. Thus, the 35% of drivers who account for more than half the miles driven are not paying premiums based on how often they are behind the wheel and increasing the potential for an insurable loss claim. We believe the traditional pricing model is inherently unfair to the majority of drivers — the 65% of drivers who drive less than half the miles driven — as they are effectively subsidizing the minority of drivers who are high-mileage drivers.

To address this issue, Metromile has leveraged technology to create accurate methods of measuring car usage and charging drivers on a “per-mile” basis. Our product development has maintained a unique focus on understanding individual driver habits to provide more granular insight into the likelihood of requiring a claim. Metromile’s position as one of the only large carriers to offer this approach to pricing — and the only carrier solely focused on low mileage drivers — underpins its opportunity to capture market share and change the industry’s approach to risk assessment.
 
An additional factor supporting this market opportunity is the large market size and significant fragmentation found in personal lines auto insurance. With over $250.0 billion in annual premiums in the United States, personal auto insurance is one of the largest lines globally. An outsized number of companies operate in the space, pricing customers with varying risk demographics and underwriting a book that meets operational and loss standards. In a market with a relatively commoditized product, pricing, customer experience and added factors becomes significant to attracting new customers. Metromile has created a new competitive advantage that drives customer volume by differentiating their core product from large and traditional carriers. This large amount of fragmentation mixed with Metromile’s unique approach supports its ability to readily attract new customers by providing a different approach to pricing.
 
The tech enabled landscape within the automotive and broader industries has also been a key point of focus for Metromile. As the usage of smartphones and technology that collects individual consumer data becomes more widespread, so too do the opportunities for insurance companies to collect more data and conduct analytics on it. This pairs with innovation in the auto space changing the true risk of operating a vehicle. Autonomous driving, driving assistance features on vehicles, or the decrease in vehicular usage due to ride-share applications have all made the personal lines auto insurance landscape more complex with respect to individual risk that cannot be captured by a collection of data points like credit score and age. This creates a fundamental need to gain insight into individual usage and leverage this data to paint a better picture of what true risk and therefore price looks like.
 
Competitive strengths
 

● | Structurally advantaged through data science. To date, we have collected approximately three billion miles of data through our core data engine. We built our engine from the ground up to realize a structural pricing and cost advantage in auto insurance. We collect our data through the next generation of connected vehicles, mobile and telematics devices to generate what we believe is the most granular and insightful data on driving behavior in the industry. We analyze data such as miles driven, speed, acceleration, hard-braking, cornering, and location to deliver market-leading intelligence. This enables us to provide highly personalized policies at scale and attractive unit economics. We currently deploy behavioral telematics, other than miles driven, in four of the eight states where we operate. We are building a durable competitive advantage through personalization, superior pricing, better fraud detection, approval automation and customer loyalty. The strength of our technological offering has even turned our infrastructure into a source of revenue. We offer our Metromile Enterprise services to a number of leading insurance carriers looking to digitize their platforms.

● | Customer-oriented approach with member loyalty. We leverage our data advantage and technology to offer customers better experiences through our use of mobile technology. We were born as a digital-first entity and have invested meaningfully to develop a seamless mobile and online experience for customers long-underserved by the traditional auto insurance industry. Customers can quickly download and use our app and access our rich feature set, enabling a shorter time to receive a quote. They also receive real-time feedback on fuel consumption and driving behavior, while we are additionally automating claims through our AI enabled platform. We believe these features and customer experience have established member loyalty to our platform and cultivated a strong brand affiliation. As of December 31, 2020, our new policy life expectancy, which is the estimated number of years a customer will remain insured with Metromile based on the historical performance of our book, is 3.4 years, and Metromile’s one-year retention rate on new policies is 69.4%, which is the percentage of customers that remain with Metromile after two policy terms, and is inclusive of all cancellation reasons, whether initiated by the customer or by us. According to the California Department of Insurance, in 2019 in California, which is Metromile’s largest market, Metromile received 13 justified complaints, which was lower than the average number of justified complaints received by the 50 largest automobile carriers in terms of exposure counts (of which Metromile ranked 49th). Each exposure count represents an insured vehicle. In addition, in 2019 in California, Metromile ranked 49 out of 50 in terms of the ratio of justified complaints to exposure counts. In 2020, Metromile decreased its justified complaint count in California by nearly 50%.

● | Full-Stack Insurance provider. In 2016, we became a full-stack carrier, enabling us to recapture economics from third-party providers. We have complete control over the entire process of writing a policy, from underwriting and investment discretion to the back-end processing that drives new customer acquisition and growth, leading to high capital-efficiency. Our premiums can grow with minimal increase in surplus, while mitigating large or tail losses. We partner with some of the leading reinsurers in the industry. We are licensed in 49 states and the District of Columbia, of which we are currently active in eight states. We aim to be a fully national provider of insurance across 49 states and the District of Columbia by 2022.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strategic partnerships in new channels. We are developing strategic partnerships with automotive giants that are helping us to win sustainable market share. Our OEM partners can help us identify low mileage drivers based on the data collected from a newly purchased vehicle and target new customer segments with our product. Access to customers that fit our target demographic who are at a decision point in insurance buying post vehicle purchase is highly valuable and allows us to showcase our unique value proposition to the right customers at the right time. And, by connecting directly to vehicles, these connected car owners can bypass needing our Pulse device. By 2022, we aim to expand the number of our OEM partners to eight (we currently have two). This channel has demonstrated a track record of impressive growth and quality customers and we anticipate millions of leads per year through this channel at a low cost of acquisition.

● | World-class talent. The Metromile team comprises a blend of experienced technology industry executives, the best data scientists and leading insurance industry veterans. Our diverse mix of talent has helped us look at the automotive insurance industry through an alternative lens. We pride ourselves on our unique DNA and fresh outlook. We focus on hiring the best talent from a wide array of backgrounds to provoke diversity of thought and ideas. Our leadership team exemplifies our foundation in data science. Chairman David Friedberg previously worked at Google and founded and successfully scaled the Climate Corporation, culminating in a $1.1 billion acquisition of the business by Monsanto in 2013. Dan Preston first trained as a data scientist and joined Metromile as Chief Technology Officer in 2013 before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. Paw Andersen, who joined Metromile in early 2019 as Chief Technology Officer, is a technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber’s Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Outside of key leadership, David and Dan have built a tremendous team of technologists, insurance experts and finance veterans culled from companies including Progressive, Salesforce, and PricewaterhouseCoopers to the most innovative startups.

Our Operating Model
 
Our playbook for developing and growing markets is an iterative, deliberate methodology designed to ensure that all types of consumers, regardless of their “driver class”, receive competitive rates that deliver substantial savings, while pricing to accurately reflect their expected losses. Thus, as a market matures and achieves positive unit economics, we believe our ability to scale and deploy additional capital in that market increases. Our most mature markets have the largest market penetration and strongest unit economics, which is the result of a focused effort to both improve unit profitability and efficiency in Customer Acquisition Cost, or CAC.
 
These efforts, in aggregate, have led to year-over-year improvements in direct loss ratio.

Our revenue and gross profit are significantly impacted by our reinsurance program, the terms of which vary from year-to-year. Our reinsurance program includes an upfront policy fee paid to us by the reinsurers for each new policy entering into the program, as a way for us to recover policy acquisition costs. We record this as other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We then cede most of the premium earned on that policy to the reinsurance syndicate and earn back a share of the realized profit from the policy, over time, which is also recognized as other revenue.
 
Because our reinsurance program has varied year-to-year and the onboarding allowance portion of the program results in the recognition of more revenue during periods in which we sell more policies, we have seen a significant variance in our quarterly and annual revenue. Our other revenue and gross profit declined year-over-year, primarily due to the upfront policy fee we received from our reinsurers for new policies sold in 2019 relative to 2020. In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had other revenue of $27.0 million and $22.1 million, respectively. Our gross profit declined from $(4.9) million to $(14.1) million for the same period.
 
We use reinsurance to reduce the likelihood of paying a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim. Our reinsurance arrangements provide for the transfer of a portion of our risk portfolio to a third-party in exchange for a share of the insurance premium, e.g., we cede a portion of the premium paid per policy. As we cede risk and premium, we not only transfer risk of loss, but are able to underwrite additional policies and generate additional premiums.
 
Since May 2017, we have proportional reinsurance arrangements protecting our business. Proportional reinsurance means that premium and losses are calculated on a pro rata basis. To date, we have four reinsurance programs and a total of five reinsurance counterparties including Partner Re, Mapfre Re, Cincinnati Insurance Company, Horseshoe Re, and Topsail Re. See also Note 9, Reinsurance, to the Legacy Metromile Audited Financial Statements for information regarding Metromile’s reinsurers and its reinsurance programs. Each program has multiple reinsurance agreements varying based on the number of reinsurance counterparties participating in the respective reinsurance program. The reinsurance arrangements cover policies entering into the reinsurance arrangement during that contract year and continue coverage for a term ranging from six to nine years. During any fiscal year, we may be ceding premium under multiple reinsurance arrangements, which have varying terms.
 
The reinsurance arrangement includes an upfront policy fee paid by the reinsurers for each new policy entering into the reinsurance program as a way for us to recover policy acquisition costs. This upfront policy fee is renegotiated for each contract year and varies by contract year, relative to our policy acquisition costs. We record this upfront policy fee as other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. During periods with increased policy sales, the amount recorded to other revenue will also increase, which is a key driver of gross profit. Correspondingly, periods of decreased policy sales will result in a decrease to the amounts recorded to other revenue.
 
The reinsurance arrangement covering the periods May 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018 and May 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019 covered 85% of our renewal policies and beginning May 1, 2019, the reinsurance arrangements expanded to also include new policies. Thus, since May 1, 2019, we have ceded a larger percentage of our premium than in prior periods, resulting in a significant decrease in our revenues as reported under GAAP. We expect to revise our reinsurance structure towards the end of 2021 into a more simplified structure with a reduced quota share, which over time, will reduce the amount of ceded premium, and we expect will reduce the overall cost of our reinsurance arrangements.
 
In addition, under the reinsurance agreements effective May 1, 2017 and May 1, 2018, LAE is ceded at a fixed rate of 3% of ceded earned premium. Under the reinsurance agreement effective May 1, 2019, LAE is ceded at a fixed rate of 6% of ceded earned premium and will be revalued effective May 1, 2021. Under the reinsurance agreement effective May 1, 2020, LAE is ceded at a fixed rate of 4.75 – 6.0% of ceded earned premium. For the reinsurance agreements effective May 1, 2017 and May 1, 2018, Metromile receives a 10.2% ceding commission, adjusted up or down based on loss ratios of the ceded business. For the reinsurance agreement effective May 1, 2019, Metromile receives a 10.0% ceding commission. For the reinsurance agreement effective May 1, 2020, Metromile receives a 10.0 – 11.75% ceding commission, adjusted up or down based on loss performance of the ceded business.

Because of the effect that our reinsurance program has on our revenue and gross profit, we believe contribution profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a more useful metric to evaluate the fundamentals underlying the profitability of our insurance operation. Contribution profit is calculated as direct earned premium, plus investment income earned at the insurance company, minus direct losses, direct loss adjustment expense, and variable costs associated with the servicing of policies. Contribution margin is contribution profit divided by direct earned premium plus investment income earned at the insurance company. See “Metromile’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information regarding our use of contribution profit/(loss) and contribution margin and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.
 
While our gross margin declined from (9.3)% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to (40.3)% for the year ended December 31, 2020, our contribution margin has steadily improved as our investments in technology and operations have been realized.
 

Our average new customer lifetime as of year-end 2020 was estimated to be 3.4 years and our contribution margin was 12%. For a new customer, the one-year retention ratio at year-end 2020 was 69.4%, which is inclusive of all cancellation reasons, whether initiated by the customer or by us.
 
Metromile’s Growth Strategy
 
Scale our position in existing markets. We have an established presence in our existing markets — eight states in the United States that represent approximately 30% of the market for drivers. Our data engine is helping us to continuously learn more about our customers and their driving behaviors, which allows us to improve price competitiveness in new segments. As our data aggregates over time, we become more sophisticated in our pricing, analysis and predictions while our competitors remain broadly stagnant. Our financial profile improves as we scale and refine our local market knowledge. This improved financial profile frees up more capital to invest in furthering our technical advantages and growing our customer base.
 
Expand nationally across the United States. We will apply our highly replicable model of “active-on” nationally, with a tailored approach to each state, driven by the regulatory environment and local market dynamics. This will allow us to expand rapidly and efficiently across different geographies while maintaining a high level of control over the specific strategy within each state. We aim to be in 21 states by the end of 2021 and 49 states and the District of Columbia by the end of 2022. We do not yet have visibility on whether or not these 41 new markets will permit the use of behavioral telematics data to offer polices and premiums based on driving habits in addition to miles driven. As we expand into new markets, when appropriate, we plan to engage in discussion with state insurance regulators to expand our ability to use behavioral telematics, which we expect will evolve over time. Our data platform will continue to inform new and existing markets as we successfully scale.
 
Scale partnerships & key channels. Our existing channels have been continually optimized for lower CAC and heightened throughput. We market through a variety of channels, including direct-to-consumer advertisements, display, search, and social media marketing, search engine optimization, and customer referrals. Our products are customer-centric with an overall NPS of 56, and we benefit greatly from word-of-mouth marketing.

In addition to the existing growth engine, we have adopted new channels. First, we pioneered the Ride Along tool through our mobile app, which has helped us radically increase our quote purchasing — in the recent period since its launch, 11% of our abandoned quotes have tried Ride Along, while we enjoy a 25% referral rate in this channel and a 20% conversion rate.
 
Second, we have developed strategic partnerships with key players in the automotive industry. Through our relationships with OEM partners, we expect considerable success in growing our customer base, as we can effectively and accurately target low-mileage drivers. We estimate that this channel can deliver over one million leads per year at a low cost of acquisition.
 
Scale our Enterprise Software business. The investments we have made in our platform to develop key economic advantages have turned a traditional cost center into a source of accelerated value creation. We offer Enterprise Software and related services to other leading insurance carriers who want to leverage our technology to improve their operating performance. Enterprise customers can dramatically improve their loss adjustment expenses and losses due to fraud by using our solution. Our holistic set of services include fraud detection, digital customer portal, process automation and telematics enablement. Launched in 2019, Metromile Enterprise is scaling to be a substantial contributor to our financial results.
 
Cross-sell with new products and services. With active and loyal customers, we intend to build on that foundation to offer an expanded product offering. We believe that there is a compelling cross-sell opportunity for other insurance services including homeowners insurance, and renters insurance, and car maintenance. Through a mix of strong partners and new internal product development, we expect to bring these products to market in an intuitive manner, consistent with the experience Metromile customers expect from us.
 
Investments
 
Our portfolio of investable assets is primarily held in cash, short-term investments, and available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, and asset backed securities. We manage the portfolio in accordance with investment policies and guidelines approved by our board of directors, in consultation with legal counsel and as may be required to be approved by applicable regulatory authorities. We have designed our investment policy and guidelines to provide a balance between current yield, conservation of capital, and liquidity requirements of our operations setting guidelines that provide for a well-diversified investment portfolio that is compliant with insurance regulations applicable to the states in which we operate.
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive segment of the insurance industry. Many of our primary and direct competitors have well-established national brands, a longer operating history, and market similar products, including at prices comparable to ours. Our competitors include large national insurance companies such as Progressive, Allstate, and Nationwide, as well as up-and-coming companies and new market entrants in the InsurTech industry, some of whom also utilize telematics and offer forms of usage-based insurance. Several of these established national insurance companies are larger than us and have significant competitive advantages over us, including increased name recognition, greater resources, access to additional capital, and more types of insurance coverage to offer the consumer, such as renters, homeowners, health and life, than we currently do. In particular, many of these competitors offer consumers the ability to purchase multiple other types of insurance coverage and “bundle” them together into one policy and, in certain circumstances, include an umbrella liability policy for additional coverage at competitive prices. We do not offer such “bundles” and are specialized in one type of insurance — personal automotive insurance. Moreover, as we expand into new lines of business and offer additional products, we could face intense competition from traditional insurance companies that are already established in such markets.
 
Competition is based on many factors, including the reputation and experience of the insurer, coverages offered, pricing and other terms and conditions, customer service, size, and financial strength ratings, among other considerations. We believe we compete favorably across many of these factors, and have developed a platform and business model based on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and a stand out customer experience that we believe will be difficult for incumbent insurance providers to emulate and utilize like we have.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and electronic and physical security measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal, contractual, and other protections, we believe that factors such as the skill and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are large contributors to our success in the marketplace. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection on such enhancements to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
 
As of January 31, 2021, we have five issued patents and three pending patent applications in the United States. The issued patents generally relate to determining the route and parking location of a vehicle, recording trip data associated with a vehicle, and estimating the usage of a vehicle based on refueling events. The issued patents are expected to expire between September 1, 2035 and January 11, 2036. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
 
We have trademark rights in our name, our logo, and other brand indicia, and have trademark registrations for select marks in the United States. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business.
 
Although we believe our intellectual property rights are valuable and strong, intellectual property rights are sometimes subject to invalidation or circumvention. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.”
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of February 28, 2021, we had 259 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
