ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
SolarWinds is a leading provider of information technology, or IT, infrastructure management software. Our products give organizations worldwide, regardless of type, size or IT infrastructure complexity, the power to monitor and manage the performance of their IT environments, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid models. We combine powerful, scalable, affordable, easy to use products with a high-velocity, low-touch sales model to grow our business while also generating significant cash flow. 
Our business is focused on building products that enable technology professionals to manage “all things IT.” We continuously engage with technology professionals to understand the challenges they face maintaining high-performing and highly available on-premises, public and private cloud and hybrid IT infrastructures. The insights we gain from engaging with technology professionals allow us to build products that solve well-understood IT management challenges in ways that technology professionals want them solved. We sell a comprehensive portfolio of Core IT Management products that are designed for ITOps, DevOps and IT security professionals. We also sell cloud-based software solutions purpose-built to enable managed service providers, or MSPs, to support digital transformation and growth within small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, around the world. 
 Our approach, which we call the “SolarWinds Model,” enables us to market and sell our products directly to network and systems engineers, database administrators, storage administrators, DevOps and service desk professionals and MSPs. These technology professionals have become empowered to influence the selection, and often the purchase, of products needed to rapidly solve the problems they confront.
We serve the entire IT market uniquely and efficiently with our SolarWinds Model. Technology professionals use our products in organizations ranging in size from very small businesses to large enterprises. Our products are designed to do the complex work of monitoring and managing networks, systems and applications across on-premises, cloud and hybrid IT environments without the need for customization or professional services. Many of our products are built on common technology platforms that enable our customers to easily purchase and deploy our products individually or as integrated suites as their needs evolve. We utilize a cost-efficient, integrated global product development model and have expanded our offerings over time through both organic development and strategic acquisitions. 
We market and sell our products directly to technology professionals primarily through a high-velocity, low-touch, digital marketing and direct inside sales approach that we call “selling from the inside.” We have built a highly flexible and analytics-driven marketing model designed to efficiently drive website traffic and high-quality leads. We also engage with both existing and prospective customers using our online communities such as THWACK and MSP Institute. These communities are designed to train and inform technology professionals about our products, keep us connected to them and provide network effects to amplify word-of-mouth marketing for our products. Our sales team uses a prescriptive approach designed to manage these leads and quickly sell our products pursuant to our standard pricing and contract terms. We do not utilize an outside sales force or provide professional services.
Technology professionals often find our products when they are online searching for a solution to address a specific need and use our full-featured trials to experience our purpose-built, powerful and easy to use products in their own environments. These experiences often lead to initial purchases of one or more products and, over time, purchases of additional products and advocacy within both their organizations and their networks of technology professionals. 
We also extend our sales reach through our MSP customers, who provide IT management as a service and rely on our products to deploy, manage and secure the IT environments of their end customers. Our MSP customer base enables us to reach across a fragmented end market opportunity consisting of millions of SMEs around the world. We benefit from the addition of end customers served by our MSP customers, the proliferation of devices managed by those MSPs and the expansion of products used by those MSPs to provide managed services to their end customers. We grow with our MSP customers as they add new customers and deliver new or enhanced services based on our solutions and when their SME customers add devices and services.
We have grown while maintaining high levels of operating efficiency. We derive our revenue from a combination of subscription revenue from the sale of our MSP, application performance management and IT service management, or ITSM products, and license and maintenance revenue from the sale of our on-premises network and IT operations management perpetual license products. Over time, we have significantly increased our subscription and maintenance revenue and intend to grow our revenue and cash flow by gaining new customers, increasing penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our international footprint, bringing new products to market and expanding into new markets through organic development and targeted acquisitions.
SolarWinds Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015.
Cyber Incident
On December 14, 2020, we announced that we had been the victim of a cyberattack on our Orion Software Platform and internal systems, or the “Cyber Incident.” For further information about the Cyber Incident, see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Cyber Incident” included in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Potential Spin-Off of MSP Business 
On August 6, 2020, we announced that our board of directors has authorized management to explore a potential spin-off of our MSP business into a newly created and separately traded public company, and on December 9, 2020, we announced that we confidentially submitted with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a Form 10 registration statement with respect to the potential spin-off. If completed, the standalone entity would provide cloud-based software solutions for MSPs, enabling them to support digital transformation and growth within SMEs. SolarWinds would retain our Core IT Management business focused primarily on selling software and cloud-based services to corporate IT organizations. We believe that, if completed, the potential spin-off would allow each company to more effectively pursue its distinct operating priorities, strategies and capital allocation policies, while also allowing stockholders to separately evaluate and value the companies based on their distinct markets, strategies and performance. If we proceed with the spin-off, it would be intended to be structured as a tax-free, pro-rata distribution to all SolarWinds stockholders as of a record date to be determined by the board of directors of SolarWinds. If completed, upon effectiveness of the transaction, SolarWinds stockholders would own shares of both companies. Completion of any spin-off would be subject to various conditions, including final approval of our board of directors, and there can be no assurance that the potential spin-off will be completed in the manner described above, or at all. If we proceed with the spin-off, we currently are targeting to complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2021.
The SolarWinds Model
At the heart of everything we do as a company is the SolarWinds Model, which consists of five principles that guide our business and help explain why technology professionals choose our products:
Focus on the Technology Professional
We are committed to understanding technology professionals and the daily challenges that they face managing the complex, ever-changing demands of business-critical IT environments. We have a substantial customer base and community of technology professionals. We engage with them on a daily basis through digital marketing and online communications. These include THWACK, our online community that provides forums to registered members, tools and valuable resources. Additionally, through our MSP Institute, our MSP customers gain access to business, sales, marketing and technical training. We also manage several company-sponsored blogs in which we provide perspectives and information relevant to the IT management market, as well as web-based events designed to train and inform participants about deeper aspects of our products. We don’t have to guess about what they need, we just ask.
Build Great Products for the Entire Market
Organizations of all sizes have complex IT environments that make managing IT challenging. Our commitment to technology professionals allows us to deliver products that solve well-understood IT problems simply, quickly and affordably for the entire market, from very small businesses to the largest of global enterprises, regardless of whether their IT is managed internally or through an MSP.
We design our products to be easy to access, try, buy, deploy and use. Many of our products are built on common technology platforms that enable our customers to purchase and implement our products individually, and then add additional product or products as needed. Or they can buy multiple products as integrated suites. This allows customers to buy what they need, when they need it, and grow as their needs evolve.
Capture Demand Using Cost-Efficient, Mass-Reach Digital Marketing
We utilize digital marketing to directly reach technology professionals of all levels of sophistication managing IT environments of all levels of complexity and size. They are online every day interacting with their peers, learning about new technologies and searching for solutions to their problems.
Over the past decade, we have honed our use of online tools to find, communicate with and sell to our potential customers of all levels of sophistication with environments of all levels of complexity and size. We believe we build credibility and confidence in our products by being present and active in the communities and on the sites that technology professionals trust.
Selling from the Inside
We are committed to selling from the inside. We adhere to a prescriptive process and metrics-based approach that drives predictability and consistency and has helped us add new customers and grow our relationships with existing customers.
The size and organization of our sales force enables us to reach thousands of technology professionals each day. We close the smallest and most simple transactions to our largest and most complex deals efficiently without the need for a traditional outside sales force, product customization or professional services. Our sales team uses a prescriptive approach designed to manage these leads and quickly sell our products pursuant to our standardized pricing and contract terms. We believe our selling motion reflects how our customers prefer to do business. 
Focus on the Long-Term Value of the Relationship with Our Customers
When our customers experience the value of our products, our investment in our product portfolio and our responsiveness to their changing needs, they often grow their relationship with us and become our advocates within both their organizations and their networks of technology professionals. The power of our approach is evidenced by the long-term relationships we have with our customers which is reflected in our strong customer retention rates. 
Growth Strategies
We intend to extend our leadership in IT infrastructure management and grow our market share in adjacent areas of IT operations with powerful yet easy to use software products designed to manage “all things IT” across hybrid IT environments. The following are key elements of our growth strategy:
Win New Customers Using the SolarWinds Model
The SolarWinds Model allows us to win new customers in existing markets where our products and our model give us a competitive advantage. Our efficient marketing and sales model and powerful brand recognition and trust among both internal IT professionals and MSPs have enabled us to increase our customer base. We intend to leverage our ability to efficiently attract new customers to continue to increase our overall customer base.
Increase Penetration Within Our Existing Customer Base
Many of our internal IT customers make an initial purchase to meet an immediate need, such as network or application performance monitoring in a small portion of their IT infrastructure, and then subsequently purchase additional products for other use cases or expansion across their organization. Similarly, our MSP customers expand usage of our offerings over time when they add new customers and when their customers add new devices and services. For example, our MSP customers may start with remote monitoring and management or backup and recovery, and subsequently purchase additional, integrated products offerings. Once our customers have used our products within their IT environment, we are well positioned to help identify additional products that offer further value to those customers. We continue to refine our sales effort to better target our marketing and sales efforts and expand the sales of our products within organizations, particularly those that have multiple purchasers of our IT management products.  
Increase Our International Footprint
We believe a substantial market opportunity exists to increase our international footprint across all of our product lines. In particular, our application performance management and ITSM products, which are currently sold primarily in North America, have strong international expansion potential. We have made significant investments in recent years to increase our sales and marketing operations internationally, and expect to continue to invest to grow our international sales and global brand awareness. 
Continue to Innovate
We intend to continue focusing on innovation and bringing new products and tools to market that address problems that technology professionals are asking us to solve. We also intend to continue providing frequent feature releases to our existing products. We are focused on enhancing the overall integration of our products to improve our value proposition and allow our customers to further benefit from expanding their usage of our products as their needs evolve.
Expand into New Markets Aligned with the SolarWinds Model
We have successfully entered new markets and expanded our product offerings to solve a broader set of challenges for customers. For example, in recent years we broadened our product offerings to address the database, storage, cloud, MSP and ITSM markets. We intend to further expand into markets where our SolarWinds Model provides us with competitive advantages.
Pursue Targeted Acquisitions of Products and Technologies
We have successfully acquired and integrated businesses and technologies in the past that provided us with new product offerings and capabilities and helped us to establish positions in new segments and markets. We intend to continue making targeted acquisitions that complement and strengthen our product portfolio and capabilities or provide access to new markets. We evaluate acquisition opportunities to assess whether they will be successful within the SolarWinds Model. We believe our ability to effectively transition acquired companies and products to the SolarWinds Model represents a unique opportunity for our business.
Our Customers and Market
We designed the SolarWinds Model to reach all sizes of businesses. Our customers represent organizations ranging in size from very small businesses to large enterprises. Customers often initially purchase one of our products to solve a known problem and then expand their purchases over time. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had over 320,000 customers. We define customers as individuals or entities that have purchased one or more of our products under a unique customer identification number since our inception for our perpetual license products and individuals or entities that have an active subscription for at least one of our subscription products. Each unique customer identification number constitutes a separate customer regardless of the amount purchased. We may have multiple purchasers of our products within a single organization, each of which may be assigned a unique customer identification number and deemed a separate customer. Included among this number are more than 25,000 MSP customers serving over 500,000 SMEs globally as of December 31, 2020. We count MSP partners as active subscribers to one or more of our products at the end of the measurement period.
The SolarWinds Model allows us to both sell to a broad group of potential customers and close large transactions with significant customers. At the same time, we designed the SolarWinds Model to reach millions of SMEs around the world that outsource the management of some or all of their IT infrastructure to MSPs. We reach SMEs through MSPs and directly, including those SMEs that may purchase a single product to solve a known problem.
Organizations across industries are using technology and software to drive business success and competitive differentiation. As the landscape for IT infrastructure and software deployment worldwide rapidly changes to meet businesses’ evolving needs, the performance, speed, availability and security of IT has become critical to business strategy. The job of the technology professionals who deploy and manage these environments is more challenging than ever. 
Growing IT Complexity Creates Significant Challenges for Organizations
As organizations deploy and rely on a mix of on-premises, public and private cloud and hybrid IT environments, they require performance monitoring and management solutions that work across their increasingly complex environments and provide full visibility into performance. 
Empowerment of the Technology Professional
The technology professionals charged with managing these infrastructures are increasingly responsible for making technology choices to help ensure the performance of their IT infrastructure meets the needs of the business. Additionally, the democratization of IT spend has shifted influence in software purchase decisions from the highest levels of an organization’s IT department to technology professionals, who can have different perspectives from CIOs or other IT decision-makers. We have found that technology professionals prefer to trial software products in real time to determine if the products meet their needs. They also want the flexibility to select from a range of IT management products to find those best suited to address their specific challenges. In this environment, technology professionals are among the biggest influencers of software-purchasing decisions within their organizations.
Organizations Have Choices in Allocating Resources to Manage IT
As IT complexity grows, organizations must determine how to allocate their resources to best manage their IT needs. Organizations can choose to manage their own IT infrastructure or buy IT management as a service through MSPs. MSPs maintain and operate an organization’s IT environment and can deliver the full range of IT solutions, including network monitoring, server and desktop management, backup and recovery and IT security. For many smaller organizations that lack the 
time, resources and technical expertise to manage complex IT environments, MSPs can improve the efficacy of their IT strategy without significant capital investment. For larger organizations, MSPs can replace or supplement in-house capabilities. 
Limitations of Alternative Solutions
Alternative IT management solutions have limitations that impair their ability to efficiently serve the unique needs of technology professionals. These solutions can be expensive, complicated and inflexible and may require significant professional services to customize, implement, operate and maintain.
Given the challenges associated with operating across a complex range of dynamic, hybrid IT environments and the limited ability of existing solutions to address these challenges in the ways that technology professionals want them addressed, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for broad hybrid IT management solutions purpose-built to serve the needs of technology professionals. 
Product Portfolio and Technology Platforms
We offer a broad portfolio of products to monitor and manage network, systems, desktop, application, storage, database, website infrastructures and IT service desks. We intend to continue to innovate and invest in areas of product development that bring new products to market and enhance the functionality, ease of use and integration of our current products. We may also introduce new technology through relationships with other technology companies. We believe this will strengthen the overall value proposition of our products in any IT environment. 
Our product development is guided by principles that provide a development framework that allows us to respond quickly to the market and deliver a broad suite of products designed to solve problems that are commonly understood and shared by our customers. Our core product development principles are:
1.We purpose-build products for technology professionals. 
2.Our roadmaps are guided by a large community of users rather than by a select few large customers.
3.We develop products that are intended to sell themselves and be easy to use, powerful and immediately valuable to users. 
4.We design and develop our products to integrate and complement each other while providing a consistent user experience. 
We believe we have one of the broader product portfolios of IT monitoring and management software across the industry, providing deep visibility into network, systems, desktop, application, storage, database, website infrastructures, and virtual resources performance. Our products monitor applications and their supporting infrastructure, regardless of whether that infrastructure is located on-premises, in the cloud or in hybrid model. Our products monitor applications in the cloud via an agent, agentlessly, or by using information from cloud providers’ APIs.
Core IT Management Products
Targeted for ITOps, DevOps, and IT Security Professionals, our Core IT Management products provide hybrid IT performance management with deep visibility into applications, IT infrastructures, and the full IT stack, while remaining infrastructure-location agnostic. Our comprehensive product portfolio covers the needs of all IT professionals and their hybrid IT environments. A one-stop shop for IT management, our product capabilities include network management, infrastructure management, application performance management, IT service management and IT security. Our Core IT Management products include the products we categorized as IT Operations Management, or ITOM, in previous filings.
Our suite of network management software provides real-time visibility into network utilization and bandwidth as well as the ability to quickly detect, diagnose and resolve network performance problems. Our suite of infrastructure management products monitors and analyzes the performance of applications and their supporting infrastructure, including websites, servers, physical, virtual and cloud infrastructure, storage and databases. We also help our customers strengthen their security and compliance posture with our automated network configuration, backup and log and event management products. 
Our suite of application performance management software enables visibility into log data, cloud infrastructure metrics, applications, tracing, and web performance management.
Our service management software provides a robust and easy-to use comprehensive, ITIL-compliant service desk solution for companies of all sizes. We help our customers manage their employee service challenge needs whether through simple ticketing or a powerful ITSM solution, removing the manual burden of managing incoming tickets and tracking technology assets with the products cutting-edge automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.
Our hybrid IT offerings are highly scalable and can be added alongside existing products in a modular fashion. The integration of our products combines data from multiple parts of the IT stack to provide a single, unified application centric 
view and customer experience. Our Core IT Management products also enable a single dashboard to view real-time application metrics regardless of whether the applications are deployed across multiple data centers or cloud vendors globally.
MSP Products
We deliver a portfolio of integrated products that enable MSPs to deploy, manage, and secure technologies for their SME end customers, as well as and more efficiently manage their own businesses. Purpose-built to address a wide range of MSP partner needs, our multi-tenant, subscription-based platform is scalable, extensible and easy to deploy. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we rebranded our MSP products and began selling them under the "N-able" brand. 
We provide three categories of products to our MSP customers: remote monitoring and management, security and data protection and business management. Our broad remote monitoring and management capabilities include real-time availability and performance of networks and devices and automation of policies and workflows. We provide a layered protection approach spanning network and systems infrastructure, applications, and end user devices through our data protection, patch management, endpoint security, web protection, e-mail security and archiving and vulnerability assessment solutions. Our fully cloud-based data protection capabilities include storage efficient backup, high-speed restoration and disaster recovery for servers, workstations, files, data and key cloud-based applications. In addition, our business management solutions help improve the technical and service delivery efficiencies of our MSP partners and include professional services automation and password and documentation management.
Marketing and Sales
We market and sell our products directly to technology professionals with a low-touch, high-velocity digital marketing and “selling from the inside” motion that we believe is unique and hard to replicate in the software industry. Our marketing efforts and selling motion allow us to effectively capture demand and maintain high levels of sales productivity at low customer acquisition costs. 
We target our marketing efforts and selling motion directly at network, systems, DevOps and MSP professionals within organizations. We believe this approach provides us with a significant advantage in today’s environment in which purchasing influence and power is shifting from traditional procurement to the technology professionals themselves.
Marketing
We have built a highly flexible and analytics-driven direct marketing model designed to efficiently drive website traffic and high-quality leads that are typically trials of full-featured products from our websites. By providing trials of full-featured products we enable prospective customers to easily explore the capabilities of our products and easily transition from trial to sale. We also have a marketing motion directed at current customers designed to educate them about features of products they own, products they do not own and how to trial new products.
We make broad use of digital marketing tools including search engines, targeted email campaigns, localized websites, virtual events, free IT management tools, display advertising, affiliate marketing, social media, e-book distribution, video content, blogging and webinars.
We also engage using our online community, THWACK. Within THWACK, we provide forums, solutions, tools, webinars, content and other valuable resources relevant to the IT management market. This community is designed to train and inform technology professionals about our products, keep us connected to them and provide network effects to amplify word-of-mouth marketing for our products. Additionally, through our MSP Institute, our MSP customers gain access to business, sales, marketing and technical training from industry experts and leaders.
Sales
We refer to our selling motion as “selling from the inside.” This approach is rooted in having our sales organization physically located in our offices, selling online or over the phone, using a prescriptive approach to managing leads and adhering to standardized pricing and contract terms. We close transactions of all sizes and locations through our selling from the inside approach. 
Our sales organization is divided into our dedicated sales team and our retention and maintenance renewal team. Our dedicated sales team focuses exclusively on sales of new products to new and existing customers. Our dedicated sales team receives high-quality leads from our marketing motion and engages with the prospect to close the sale. We adhere to a disciplined, data-driven approach to converting leads quickly and efficiently based on our understanding of the prospect’s specific product demands and the inflection points in the selling process.
Our retention and maintenance renewal team focuses exclusively on renewing our subscription and maintenance agreements with our customers. Our conversations with these customers begin months before the renewal date to support our customers, and we work with them through the renewal process.
In addition to selling to SMEs directly, our alignment with our MSP partners gives us the leverage and sales reach to efficiently and effectively serve the SME market and to grow with our MSP partners as they expand their customer bases, deliver new services powered by our solutions and when their customers add devices and services.
We also sell our software through distributors and resellers to supplement our direct sales force, expand our global presence, reach various market segments and help us to initiate and fulfill sales orders from state, local and federal governments and those commercial customers that prefer to make purchases through a particular reseller. We contract directly with end customers when we sell our products through channel partners. We have a number of resellers who are proactively creating demand for our products and bring new opportunities and customers to us. 
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing and deployment of new products and improvements to existing products, with a focus on ensuring that our products integrate and complement one another. As part of our new "Secure by Design" framework, we are making adaptations and enhancements to the security of our internal environment, software development processes and deployment of our products. 
In our software development process, we work closely with our user community throughout the development process to build what is needed for the problems technology professionals face every day. This includes regularly having a subset of our customers participate in validating that our product use cases and features will solve their problems.
Over more than a decade, we have honed our approach to building a development organization that allows us to build products and enhance existing products quickly and efficiently. Our global development model allows us to source from a large pool of talented resources by participating in multiple labor markets to match the best person to each role. We utilize small scrum teams, each dedicated to specific product modules that follow a standard set of practices to build and test their code continuously. We share our development values across our offices and aim to assign meaningful design and development work to our international locations. 
We believe that we have developed a differentiated process that allows us to release new software rapidly, efficiently and with a high level of quality.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in networks, applications, devices, operating systems and deployment environments result in evolving customer requirements. Our competitors and potential competitors include:
•large network management and IT vendors such as Cisco Systems, MicroFocus, CA Technologies, IBM and BMC Software; and
•smaller companies in the cloud and application monitoring and the MSP IT tools markets, including MSP pure-play vendors and niche or domain-specific vendors that provide solutions focused on a particular service that may be sold by MSPs, where we do not believe that a single or small group of companies has achieved market leadership.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are:
•brand awareness and reputation among technology professionals, including IT professionals, DevOps professionals and MSPs;
•product capabilities, including scalability, performance, security and reliability;
•ability to solve problems for companies of all sizes and infrastructure complexities;
•ease of use;
•total cost of ownership;
•flexible deployment models, including on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid environment;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•focus on customer success.
We believe that we compete effectively across these factors as our products and marketing efforts have been designed with these criteria as guideposts.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection. As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 38 issued U.S. patents and 194 issued foreign patents, with expiration dates ranging from December 2026 to March 2038. We have also filed approximately 66 currently pending patent applications, but we cannot guarantee that patents will be issued with respect to our current patent applications in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek or at all. Our patents and any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We endeavor to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with which we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of, and safeguard our ownership of, our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe our intellectual property, and policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on any legal actions against these infringers being successful, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available or where we have operations. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had 3,340 employees fully dedicated to our business, of which 1,191 were employed in the United States and 2,149 were employed outside of the United States. We strive to be a people-centric company and believe we have a positive relationship with our employees, which we continue to nurture and develop. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreement.
Our success is the result of our talented, experienced and high performing employees across our organization, including functions such as research and development, sales and marketing, partner success and general and administrative.
As a global company, we have the distinct advantage of employing talented and diverse individuals across different ethnicities, genders, races, religions, sexual orientations and generations, all supported by a culture of innovation and inclusion. Our culture of collaboration enables us to deliver strong financial performance and build lasting relationships with our communities around the world.
We believe the combination of our relationship with our employees, strength of our software platform, alignment with our customers and business model differentiates us in the market. Our ability to achieve our goals has always been, and continues to be, a result of the strong values and tremendous passion of our people. We continue to invest heavily in attracting top talent, training and development initiatives and motivating and retaining high potential employees.
