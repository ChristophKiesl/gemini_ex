ITEM 1. BUSINESS    
General

We are committed to improving the sleep of more people, every night, all around the world. As a global leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of bedding products, we know how crucial a good night of sleep is to overall health and wellness. Utilizing over a century of knowledge and industry-leading innovation, we deliver award-winning products that provide breakthrough sleep solutions to consumers in over 100 countries.
Tempur Sealy has strong brands across a portfolio of bedding products serving a wide range of price points. Our highly recognized brands include Tempur-Pedic®, Sealy® featuring Posturepedic® Technology and Stearns & Foster® and our non-branded offerings include private label and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") products. Our distinct brands allow for complementary merchandising strategies. 
Our powerful distribution model operates through an omni-channel strategy. Our products are sold across wholesale and direct channels through brick and mortar retail stores and e-commerce platforms. We have a global manufacturing footprint with approximately 9,000 employees around the world. Tempur Sealy has a strong competitive presence in the bedding marketplace with a leadership position that comes from product and service quality, culture, strategy and people, backed with financial strength and a disciplined approach to returning value to shareholders.
Our long-term strategy is to drive earnings growth with high return on invested capital and strong free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. In order to achieve our long-term strategy while managing the current economic and competitive environments, we focus on developing the most innovative bedding products in all the markets we serve, making significant investments in our iconic global brands and optimizing our worldwide omni-channel distribution. We also intend to generate earnings growth through ongoing investments in research and development and productivity initiatives, which will improve our profitability and create long-term stockholder value.
We operate in two segments: North America and International. Corporate operating expenses are not included in either of the segments and are presented separately as a reconciling item to consolidated results. These segments are strategic business units that are managed separately based on geography. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we realigned our business segment reporting to include Mexico within the North America segment, which was previously included in the International segment. The change in segment reporting aligned with changes in how our global operations are managed. Our North America segment consists of Tempur and Sealy manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees located in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Our International segment consists of Tempur and Sealy manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees located in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America (other than Mexico).
On January 31, 2020, we acquired an 80% ownership interest in a newly formed limited liability company containing substantially all of the assets of the Sherwood Bedding business. Sherwood Bedding is a major manufacturer in the U.S. private label and OEM bedding market, and this acquisition of a majority interest marks our entrance into the private label category. 
Our principal executive office is located at 1000 Tempur Way, Lexington, Kentucky 40511 and our telephone number is (800) 878-8889. Tempur Sealy International, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in September 2002. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to such reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on our website at www.tempursealy.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the SEC. Our website and its contents are not deemed incorporated by reference into this Report.
The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The website of the SEC is www.sec.gov.
Our Products and Brands
We have a comprehensive offering of products that appeal to a broad range of consumers, some of which are covered by one or more patents and/or patent applications. We also routinely introduce new mattress models, launch new products and update our existing mattress products in each of our segments.

In order to achieve our goal to improve the sleep of more people, every night, all around the world, one of our strategic initiatives is to leverage and strengthen our comprehensive portfolio of iconic brands and products. Our portfolio of product brands includes many highly recognized brands, including Tempur®, Tempur-Pedic®, Sealy® featuring Posturepedic® Technology, Stearns & Foster® and Comfort Revolution®, which are described below: 
•Tempur-Pedic® - Founded in 1991, the Tempur brand is our specialty innovation category leader designed to provide life changing sleep for our wellness-seeking consumers. Our proprietary Tempur material precisely adapts to the shape, weight and temperature of the consumer and creates fewer pressure points, reduces motion transfer and provides personalized comfort and support. Tempur-Pedic was awarded #1 in Customer Satisfaction for the retail mattress segment in the J.D. Power 2020 Mattress Satisfaction Report. In addition to earning the highest score for overall customer satisfaction, Tempur-Pedic was ranked highest for support, durability, comfort, value, warranty and contact with customer service. 
•Stearns & Foster® - The Stearns & Foster brand offers our consumers high quality mattresses built by certified craftsmen who have been specially trained. Founded in 1846, the brand is designed and built with precise engineering and relentless attention to detail and fuses new innovative technologies with time-honored techniques, creating supremely comfortable beds. 
•Sealy® featuring Posturepedic® Technology - The Sealy brand originated in 1881 in Sealy, Texas, and for over a century has focused on offering trusted comfort, durability and excellent value while maintaining contemporary styles and great support. The Sealy Posturepedic™ brand, introduced in 1950, was engineered to provide all-over support and body alignment to allow full relaxation and deliver a comfortable night's sleep. In 2017, we united all of our Sealy products under one masterbrand, which features the Posturepedic Technology™ in the Sealy Performance™, Sealy Posturepedic Plus and Sealy Premium™ collections. 
•Cocoon by SealyTM - The Cocoon by Sealy brand, introduced in 2016, is our offering in the below $1,000 e-commerce space, made with the high quality materials that consumers expect from Sealy, sold online at www.cocoonbysealy.com and delivered in a box directly to consumers' doorsteps.
•Comfort Revolution® - Comfort Revolution originated in 1986 in West Long Beach, New Jersey. The brand develops, produces, markets and distributes bedding products.
•Non-Branded - Our non-branded product offerings include private label and OEM products, including mattresses, pillows and other bedding products and components at a wide range of price points. The addition of non-branded offerings expands our capabilities to service third-party retailers to capture manufacturing profits from bedding brands outside our own.
Our portfolio of retail brands includes Tempur-Pedic® retail stores, Sleep Outfitters®, Sleep Solutions OutletTM, SOVA and a variety of other retail brands internationally, which operate in various countries. The retail brands named above are described below: 
•Tempur-Pedic® retail stores - Tempur-Pedic® retail stores are designed for the approximately one in five of U.S. consumers, based on our research, that prefer to purchase directly from the manufacturer, and for those seeking a more personalized and educational sales experience. These retail boutiques are strategically located in high traffic, premium retail centers with customer demographics that closely align to the Tempur-Pedic customer profile. 
•Sleep Outfitters® - Sleep Outfitters is a regional bedding retailer with locations across five states in the U.S. Sleep Outfitters is a specialty mattress retailer that serves consumers across a wide range of price points with its extensive selection of Tempur-Pedic®, Sealy® and Stearns & Foster® products.
•Sleep Solutions OutletTM - Sleep Solutions Outlet stores serve as a channel of high-quality comfort returns, as well as discontinued or factory close-out mattresses and bases. There are a limited number of stores across the U.S. that sell these products, which reduces our disposal costs, and helps reduce the volume of products disposed of via landfill, thereby favorably impacting the environment.

•SOVA - SOVA is a highly respected and well established premium bedding chain in Sweden. Our stores are connected to the urban areas of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. The assortment primarily focuses on premium to ultra premium brands and well trained sales staff targeting to sell quality beds with a very high average selling price. 
In 2021, we are planning to launch a complete refresh of our North American Sealy portfolio. The updated Sealy portfolio features new models in our Posturepedic PlusTM, Posturepedic® and Essentials product lines. These models offer superior support and feature Sealy ChillTM and Surface-Guard TechnologyTM, making this product the ideal choice for the consumer searching for high quality sleep.
In 2020, we completed the national launch of the innovative Tempur-Ergo® Smart Base Collection with Sleeptracker® technology. The smart base collection is our solution for those that want to improve their sleep through technology. The Tempur-Ergo Smart Base with Sleeptracker® technology is a completely integrated sleep system that features sense and respond technology, personalized sleep analytics and coaching, smart home connectivity and voice control. 
Omni-Channel Distribution
Our primary selling channels are Wholesale and Direct. These channels align to the operating margin characteristics of our business and our marketplace. 
One of Tempur Sealy's long-term initiatives is to be wherever the consumer wants to shop, and our wholesale business strategy brings this key business initiative to life by growing our share with existing customers, gaining new business and expanding into new channels of distribution. In 2019, we announced three new or expanded third-party retail relationships in the U.S. and Europe. This resulted in the largest expansion of stores in our history. In 2020, we successfully completed product rollout to our expanded distribution relationships, realizing robust wholesale channel growth as a result. We also invested in our direct business, generating triple-digit growth in North American web sales while supporting our company-owned stores and third-party retailers throughout difficulties resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic.

We are continuing to expand our Direct channel to strengthen our distribution footprint and provide alternatives to allow the customer to shop on their preferred terms - whether online or in-store. Our Direct channel includes company-owned stores, online and call centers and represented 13.4% of net sales in 2020. The Direct channel growth rate has surpassed the Wholesale growth rate over the last few years, and we anticipate the Direct channel to continue to grow as a percentage of net sales in future years. Our expanded direct channel distribution complements our wholesale business, and we believe this balanced approach enhances the overall sales potential and profitability of Tempur Sealy.
For consumers that prefer to purchase directly from the manufacturer and for those seeking a more personalized and educational sales experience, we appeal to this consumer through our Tempur-Pedic retail stores. As of December 31, 2020, we had 76 stores throughout the U.S. that provide a low-pressure environment to explore the comprehensive line up of our Tempur-Pedic products. Each showroom features knowledgeable, non-commissioned Brand Ambassadors who educate potential customers on Tempur-Pedic products in a relaxed, comfortable environment. Going forward, our strategy for opening additional locations of Tempur-Pedic retail stores will remain consistent with our previous expansion approach. 
In addition to our high-end Tempur-Pedic retail stores, we operate Sleep Outfitters, a regional bedding retailer that had 99 stores across Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, West Virginia and Alabama in 2020. Sleep Outfitters is a specialty mattress retailer that serves consumers across all price points with its extensive selection of Tempur-Pedic®, Sealy® and Stearns & Foster® products.
Our third-party retailers, Tempur-Pedic and Sleep Outfitters retail stores reach the vast majority of consumers who still prefer to touch and feel a mattress and speak to a retail sales associate, prior to making a purchase decision. However, our consumer insights also demonstrate that there is a growing segment of the population that prefers to purchase products online and, to a lesser degree, via a call center. As such, having an omni-channel presence is more important than ever, with most customers completing research and shopping both online and in-stores before making their purchase decision.
For customers that prefer the convenience of making purchases online and having their bedding products delivered right to their front door, we have evolved our distribution model to include multiple online options to reach those that want to purchase our products without the need to go into a brick-and-mortar store.

Marketing
Our overall marketing strategy is to drive consumer demand through the use of effective marketing. We invest across multiple media platforms to build brand awareness and drive consumer interest in our products. The majority of our advertising programs are created on a centralized basis through our in-house marketing team. We plan to drive net sales through continued investments in new products, marketing and other initiatives.
We advertise nationally on television, digitally and through consumer and trade print. In addition, we participate in cooperative advertising on a shared basis with some of our retail customers. Throughout the year, we invested in a series of strategic marketing initiatives, which included new product introductions, advertising and in-store marketing investments. 
Seasonality
We believe that sales of products to furniture and bedding stores are typically subject to modest seasonality inherent in the bedding industry, with sales expected to be generally lower in the second and fourth quarters. Sales in a particular quarter can also be impacted by competitive industry dynamics. Additionally, the U.S. bedding industry generally experiences increases in sales around holidays and promotional periods.
Operations

Manufacturing and Distribution
Our products are currently manufactured and distributed through our global network of facilities. For a list of our principal manufacturing and distribution facilities, please refer to ITEM 2, "Properties". 
Suppliers
We obtain the raw materials used to produce our pressure-relieving Tempur® material and components used in the manufacture of Tempur products from outside sources. We currently acquire chemicals and proprietary additives for Tempur products as well as other components such as textiles from a number of suppliers with manufacturing locations around the world. These supplier relationships may be modified in order to maintain quality, cost, and delivery expectations. We do not consider ourselves dependent upon any single outside vendor as a source of raw materials for Tempur products and believe that sufficient alternate sources of supply for the same or similar raw materials are available. Additionally, we source our adjustable bed bases and foundations from third party manufacturers. We do not consider ourselves dependent upon any single outside manufacturer as a source of these products.
Raw materials for Sealy, Sherwood and Comfort Revolution products consist mainly of polyethylene foam, textiles and steel innerspring components that we purchase from various suppliers. In the U.S. and Canada, we source the majority of our requirements for polyurethane foam components and spring components for our Sealy and Stearns & Foster mattress units and adjustable bed bases from a key supplier for each component. We also purchase a significant portion of our Sealy foundation parts from third party sources. All critical components are purchased under supply agreements. We do not consider ourselves to be dependent in the long term upon any single outside vendor as a source of supply to our bedding business, and we believe over time that sufficient alternate sources of supply for the same, similar or alternate components are available. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, one key supplier's inability to supply components in the amount we required, as well as industry supply constraints generally, limited our production levels. Additionally, the U.S. government has mandated that domestic suppliers of certain materials used in the production of bedding products redirect such materials towards the production of personal protective equipment. This has constrained production for certain products and has increased our production costs in the near term. 
Research and Development
We have four research and development centers, three in the U.S. and one in Denmark, that conduct technology and product development. Additionally, we have a product testing facility that conducts hundreds of consumer tests annually. We believe our consumer-research driven approach to innovation results in best-in-class products that benefit the consumer.

Industry and Competition
We compete in the global bedding industry. The bedding industry is comprised of mattresses and foundations, pillows and accessories. The mattress category is comprised of traditional innerspring mattresses and non-innerspring mattresses, which includes visco-elastic and foam mattresses, innerspring/foam hybrid mattresses, airbeds and latex mattresses. The foundation category is comprised of traditional foundations and adjustable foundations. Additionally, the pillow market is comprised of traditional foam and feather pillows, as well as pillows made of visco-elastic, latex, foam, sponge, rubber and down. The primary distribution channels for bedding products are retail furniture and bedding stores, department stores, wholesale clubs and online.

We encounter competition from a number of bedding manufacturers in both the highly concentrated domestic and highly fragmented international markets. Participants in each of these markets compete primarily on price, quality, brand name recognition, product availability and product performance. Mattress and pillow manufacturers and retailers are seeking to increase their channels of distribution and are looking for new ways to reach the consumer, including the recent expansion in the number of U.S. and international companies pursuing online direct-to-consumer models for mattresses. In addition, retailers in both the U.S. and internationally are increasingly seeking to integrate vertically in the furniture and bedding industries, including by offering their own brands of mattresses and pillows.
The international market is served by a large number of manufacturers, primarily operating on a regional and local basis. These manufacturers offer a broad range of mattress and pillow products. Entry-level bedding imports from Asia began to significantly increase during 2018 and are competing against certain of our products in the U.S. market. In September 2018 and again in December 2019, petitions were filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce, alleging that many of these imports were being dumped into the U.S. market at prices less than fair value. The U.S. Department of Commerce issued an anti-dumping duty order regarding the 2018 petition on December 16, 2019 and the U.S. International Trade Commission affirmed a range of tariffs on these imports from 57% to 1,731%. Regarding the 2019 petition, the U.S. International Trade Commission reached an affirmative preliminary determination in May 2020 that there was a reasonable indication that imports of mattresses from some of the countries at issue negatively impact, or threaten to negatively impact, the domestic mattress industry. The U.S. Department of Commerce reached an affirmative preliminary determination in October 2020 regarding the 2019 petition. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission are scheduled to announce final determinations on the 2019 petition in 2021. 
Intellectual Property
Patents, Trademarks and Licensing

We hold U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications regarding certain elements of the design and function of many of our mattress and pillow products.

As of December 31, 2020, we held trademark registrations worldwide, which we believe have significant value and are important to the marketing of our products to retailers. Tempur® and Tempur-Pedic® are trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we have U.S. applications pending for additional trademarks. Several of our trademarks have been registered, or are the subject of pending applications, in various foreign countries. Each U.S. trademark registration is renewable indefinitely as long as the trademark remains in use. We also own numerous trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos and design marks, including Sealy®, Stearns & Foster® and Sealy Posturepedic®. In addition, we license the Bassett® trade name in various territories under a long-term agreement. 

We derive income from royalties by licensing Sealy® and Tempur brands®, technology and trademarks to other manufacturers. Under the license arrangements, licensees have the right to use certain trademarks and current proprietary and/or patented technology. We also provide our licensees with product specifications, research and development, statistical services and marketing programs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our licensing activities as a whole generated net royalties of approximately $21.9 million.

Governmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to international, federal, state, and local consumer protection and other regulations, primarily relating to the mattress and pillow industry. These regulations vary among the states, countries, and localities in which we do business. The regulations generally impose requirements as to the proper labeling of bedding merchandise, restrictions regarding the identification of merchandise as “new” or otherwise, controls as to hygiene and other aspects of product handling and sale and penalties for violations. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") has adopted rules relating to fire retardancy standards for the mattress industry. Many foreign jurisdictions also regulate fire retardancy standards. Future changes to these standards may require modifications to our products to comply with such changes. We are also subject to environmental and health and safety requirements with regard to the manufacture of our products and the conduct of our operations and facilities. We have made and will continue to make expenditures necessary to comply with these requirements. Currently these expenditures are immaterial to our financial results. For a discussion of the risks associated with our compliance programs in connection with these regulations, please refer to "Risk Factors" under Part I, Item 1A of this Report. 
Our principal waste products are foam and fabric scraps, wood, cardboard and other non-hazardous materials derived from product component supplies and packaging. We also periodically dispose of small amounts of used machine lubricating oil and air compressor waste oil, primarily by recycling. In the U.S., we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable international, federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations. We do not expect that compliance with international, federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We are not aware of any pending federal environmental legislation that would have a material impact on our operations, and have not been required to make, and do not expect to make, any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the foreseeable future.
In connection with sales of our products, we often collect and process personal data from our customers. As such, we are subject to certain regulations relating to information technology security and personal data protection and privacy. For example, in 2018, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR imposed a new and expanded set of ongoing compliance requirements on companies, including us, that process personal data from citizens living in the European Union ("EU"). In addition, there are country-specific data privacy laws in Europe which tend to follow the principles laid out in the GDPR, but in some cases, impose additional requirements on data controllers. In addition, several U.S. states have recently introduced legislation that mirror some of the protections provided by the GDPR. California’s Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") came into effect on January 1, 2020 and granted consumers in California certain rights related to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of their personal information that is collected by businesses, including us. We have implemented a global compliance system and have put reasonable measures in place to facilitate adherence to the continuing compliance requirements of data privacy laws such as the GDPR and CCPA.
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”)
We recognize that as a corporate citizen we have a responsibility to protect our communities and environment. Our executive leadership and board members believe that our success as an organization must be inclusive of our impact on our communities and environment. 
We delivered significant progress on our environmental initiatives in 2020. We transitioned to sourcing renewable energy from wind farms to fully power our wholly-owned U.S. and European manufacturing operations and began the installation of solar panels to partially power our largest manufacturing operations. In 2020, we also improved the percent of waste recycled from our North American wholly-owned manufacturing operations to 91.0% and achieved a 28.0% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per unit produced at our wholly-owned manufacturing and logistics operations. 
Our progress in 2020 represents a significant step towards achieving our new, long-term sustainability goal. We expect to achieve carbon neutrality by fully reducing or offsetting our greenhouse gas emissions from our wholly-owned manufacturing, logistics and retail operations by 2040. This will reduce both Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions from sources we own or control) and Scope 2 emissions (emissions attributable to the electricity we consume). We plan to achieve this long-term goal through absolute emission reductions from the continued use of renewable energy and operational efficiency improvements, as well as the funding of carbon offsets.
Table of Contents

In addition, we intend to extend our sustainability efforts to our global supply chain by encouraging our suppliers to establish their own sustainability goals. Through this initiative, we aim to increase sustainability awareness and initiatives within our supplier base with the goal of reducing our Scope 3 emissions (emissions from sources we do not directly own or control) and reducing the environmental footprint of our supply chain.
In 2020, we also delivered on our social and corporate governance initiatives. We established a qualitative ESG performance metric in executive leadership's compensation beginning in 2021. We also increased the wages of U.S. salaried employees and created new jobs in an uncertain economy, increasing our global employee headcount by 21%. 
Amid the global pandemic, keeping our employees and consumers safe and healthy was and continues to be our top priority. In addition to many employee safety initiatives, we also developed and launched our Clean Shop PromiseTM protocol which focused on providing customers a comfortable and hygienic experience as they returned to shopping in stores. These industry-leading cleanliness guidelines were implemented at all of our own stores and offered to retailers. 
Throughout the year, we also utilized our extensive operations and expertise to manufacture medical grade mattresses and other products for use by medical facilities and professionals on the frontline of the global COVID-19 pandemic. We actively engaged with numerous government and healthcare organizations to assess product need and timing, donating a significant amount of product to COVID-19 workers, healthcare facilities, field hospitals and homeless shelters. These donations marked a continuation of our legacy of charitable giving, with the Company donating over $100 million in products, cash and stock over the last ten years.
Human Capital Management

As a global organization, our workforce is important to us. We believe a key driver of long-term success is the strength of our workforce and we are committed to investing in our workforce. As part of our commitment to our workforce, we focus on the following key areas noted below:
Global Workforce and Diversity. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,000 Tempur Sealy employees, approximately 6,300 of which are located in the U.S. and 2,700 in the rest of the world. We are committed to continuing our efforts to ensure that we have a diverse workforce in terms of demographic, thought and experience. To realize our commitment to equal opportunity employment we promote a diverse slate of qualified candidates during the hiring process; outreach with organizations in each of our local communities to increase the flow of minority, female, veteran and disabled applicants for employment; conduct an annual gender and minority pay equity analysis; and attend external, community-based activities sponsored by local organizations assisting women, minorities, veterans and other demographic groups. Women represent 25% of our Board of Directors and minorities represent 13% of our Board of Directors. 
Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining. Approximately 26% of our employees are represented by various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements. Due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements, we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees. We consider our overall relations with our workforce to be satisfactory. Our current collective bargaining agreements, which are typically one to three years in length, expire at various times beginning in 2021 through 2023. As of December 31, 2020, our North America segment employed approximately 300 individuals covered under collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2021 and our International segment employed approximately 500 individuals covered under collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2021. 
Employee Retention. Employee retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve our Company goals. We believe our commitment to living out our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our employees’ well-being, supporting our employees’ career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in retention of our top-performing employees.
