Overview 
 
RMR Industrials, Inc. was incorporated on October 15, 2014 as a Nevada corporation. We are dedicated to acquiring and operating industrial assets in the United States (U.S.) which include minerals, materials and services. Our vision is to become America’s most innovative provider of industrial materials and services. We utilize differentiated operational capabilities, which we believe will allow us to outperform conventional operators through diverse markets.
 
On October 7, 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with CalX Minerals, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“CalX”) to purchase substantially all of the assets associated with the business of operating the Mid-Continent Limestone Quarry on 41 BLM unpatented placer mining claims in Garfield County, Colorado. CalX assets include the mining claims, improvements, access rights, water rights, equipment, inventory, contracts, permits, certain intellectual property rights, and other tangible and intangible assets associated with the limestone mining operation. The acquisition of these CalX assets will promote the development and implementation of the Company’s limestone mining operations in Colorado.
 
We have a strategy to own, operate, produce and distribute certain industrial minerals, including but are not limited to: feldspar, talc, mica, bentonite, vermiculite, frac sand, aggregates, antimony, barite, silica, ball clays, graphite, sulfur and zeolite. In addition, we also plan to own, operate, produce and distribute certain chemicals, including but not limited to: glycols, ethanolamines, methanol, antifreeze, biocides, corrosion inhibitors, demulsifiers, desalting compounds and dispersants. The experienced management team of RMR Industrials Inc. brings a multi-cycle successful track record of developing and licensing key intellectual property rights and discovering, financing and operating off-market natural resource businesses.
 
Strategy
 
When implementing our asset acquisition strategy, our due diligence process begins with outlining a framework for each prospective asset’s position within the vision of our consolidation strategy. In defining this framework, we seek to identify the key drivers of the business and industry, as well as the risks associated with each transaction. With our team of management and finance professionals, its board of advisors, and leading industry consultants, our due diligence process includes a full examination of each target’s managerial, operational, financial, legal, and environmental components in relation to how each facet impacts our broader strategy. Our process, while instrumental in identifying the risk level of each transaction, seeks to also identify hidden value-add opportunities within each business and for our broader portfolio.
 
We believe that the cash flows generated by the diverse business segments that we operate will provide us with the ability to pursue further development and growth acquisitions in order to build on our existing segments, or to establish a new business platform for future growth. To further supplement our capital requirements for future potential acquisitions, we intend to utilize a combination of debt and equity financings, including traditional loans from financial institutions. We will utilize a disciplined approach to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions, only pursuing those that meet our financial and strategic criteria. Our primary criteria focus on accretive assets with positive cash flow in the industrial commodities sectors. These assets should generate annual cash flow of $500,000 to $15,000,000 or annual revenues greater than $10,000,000.  For consolidating businesses within the same sector and business plan, our criteria will be focused on not only acquiring historical cash flows but also incremental products, services, proprietary technology, regional access, new customers or unique advantages.
 
Other than the CalX transaction described above, we are not currently entered into any types of asset purchase agreements, however, we are engaged in advanced negotiations with multiple companies for which we established a preliminary purchase price and key terms. We believe the target audience has been receptive due to adverse global economic factors in the energy sector, which lead us to anticipate closing on several acquisitions within the next 12 months. With macroeconomic uncertainty and the recent volatility in commodity prices, we believe many companies will be seeking an exit strategy at attractive pricing. These favorable valuations may offer increased flexibility to finance potential acquisition targets through debt or equity securities based on stable historical asset values and expectation of long-term cyclical appreciation of industrial commodity prices.

Potential Competitive Strengths 
 
We believe our process to discover, finance, develop and operate unique natural resource, intellectual property and industrial assets provides us a competitive advantage to achieve critical mass through development and acquisition of under-performing assets. Our principals have extensive experience and also collaborated in investing in and operating natural resource assets for many years. We believe our potential competitive strengths to be the following:
Application of Intellectual Property. We have a background in engineering, operations, finance and general management all within the natural resource sectors.
 
Proprietary Acquisition Sources. We have a long-standing track record of discovering unique assets pertinent to our current business strategy. We will seek to capitalize on the global network and investing and operating experience of our management team to identify, acquire and operate one or more businesses or assets in the industrial minerals mining and processing industry, although we may pursue a business combination in complementary industries, such as specialty chemicals and agriculture.
 
Status as a Public Company. Our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner to other natural resource related companies, and will provide greater access to capital and an increased company profile.
 
Management Operating and Investing Experience.  Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe will serve as a useful source of investment opportunities. Our executive officers are officers of our sponsor Rocky Mountain Resource Holdings, Inc., a privately held natural resources operating company. The management team has applied their deep understanding of historical precedents to the natural resources markets and established a reputation as one of the thought leaders within the natural resources sector. The Management team has been working together for the last ten years, over such time they have assembled a team of natural resources and investment professionals to pursue investments across the industry.
Revenues and Customers
 
For the year ended March 31, 2017, 96% of our revenue was from one customer. At March 31, 2017, approximately 85% of our account receivable was due from the same customer.
 
Industry and Competition
 
Industrial Minerals: The industrial minerals sector encompasses a large variety of minerals including: limestone, chamottes, ball clay, feldspar, graphite, ground silica, kaolin, pegmatite, quartz, mica, bauxite, bentonite, metakaolins, zeolite, frac sand, aggregates and dolomite. Industrial minerals are used in a variety of end projects for a variety of purposes. These minerals are used in ceramics, paints, plastics, paper, rubber, food, cosmetics, and many other products.
 
There are significant barriers to entry into industrial mineral production due to the scarcity of economically viable resources from which to extract the minerals. Geographical location of the resource drives a large portion of the competitive advantages or disadvantages of an operation. Large companies in this sector include Imerys, W.R. Grace, and Minerals Technologies.
 
Limestone
 
Limestone, or calcium carbonate is used in a variety of applications including coal mining, coal fired power plants, construction aggregates, glass bottle and steel manufacturing, agriculture and animal feed.
Aggregates
 
Aggregates are key material components used in the production of cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt paving mixes for the residential, nonresidential and public infrastructure markets and are also widely used for various applications and products, such as road and building foundations, railroad ballast, erosion control, filtration, roofing granules and in solutions for snow and ice control. Generally extracted from the earth using surface or underground mining and products, such methods, aggregates are produced from natural deposits of various materials such as limestone, sand and gravel, granite and trap rock.
 
Markets are typically local due to high transport costs and are generally fragmented, with numerous participants operating in localized markets. According to the March 2014 U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. market for these products was estimated at approximately 2.1 billion tons in 2013, at a total market value of $18.6 billion. Relative to other construction materials, such as cement, aggregates consumption is more heavily weighted towards public infrastructure and maintenance repair. However, the mix of end uses can vary widely by geographic location, based on the nature of construction activity in each market. Typically, three to six competitors comprise the majority market share of each local market because of the constraints around the availability of natural resources and transportation.

Industrial Chemicals: Chemical distribution is a cyclical business dependent on industrial demand. The profitability of individual companies depends on an efficient distribution system. Larger companies can offer more products and services. Local and regional distributors can compete effectively through superior service or geographic focus.
 
Chemical products in the oil and gas field segment includes iron sulfide, demulsifiers, corrosion inhibitor, emulsion breaker, paraffin solvent, biocides, methanol, dispersant and scale inhibitor. Companies create proprietary blends of these chemicals based on regional production research to solve and prevent production problems.
 
Other chemical products used in the manufacturing, peroxide stabilization, surface refinishing and as catalysts include inorganic, organometallic, metal and acid chemicals. This industry produces basic inorganic chemicals including titanium dioxide, chlor-alkali products and carbon black. Inorganic chemicals are mineral based, while organic chemicals are carbon based. Inorganic chemicals are mainly used as inputs in manufacturing and industrial processes. Inorganic chemicals used as pigments and dyes. Distribution networks are the primary channel through which these chemicals are sold to manufacturers.
 
The U.S. industry is concentrated: the largest 50 companies generate more than half of the revenue. Imports to the US of industrial chemicals and plastic resins, largely from Canada, Germany, Japan, and China, are substantial. Many of these imports move through chemical distributors. Canada, Mexico, China, Belgium, and Japan are the top recipients of US chemical exports. Major players in the global chemical market include: DuPont, PPG, BASF, Dow, Bayer, and DSM.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances in the United States and abroad relating to the protection of the environment and human health and to safety, including those pertaining to chemical manufacture and distribution, waste generation, storage and disposal, discharges to waterways, and air emissions and various other health and safety matters. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violators may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, injunctions or both. We will devote significant financial resources to ensure compliance. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all the applicable laws and regulations.
 
We anticipate that the regulation of our business operations under federal, state and local environmental laws in the United States and abroad will increase and become more stringent over time. We cannot estimate the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements or the cost of compliance.
 
United States Regulation. Statutory programs relating to protection of the environment and human health and to safety in the United States include, among others, the following. 
 
CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, also known as “CERCLA” and “Superfund”, and comparable state laws generally impose joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of specified substances, including under CERCLA those designated as “hazardous substances.” These persons include the present and certain former owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and those that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the site. These liabilities can arise in association with the properties where operations were conducted, as well as disposal facilities where wastes were sent. Many states have adopted comparable or more stringent state statutes. In the course of our operations, we generated materials that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We may be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released and may have generated hazardous substances that have been transported to or otherwise released upon offsite facilities. We may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities at which such substances have been released by previous owners or operators and offsite facilities to which our wastes were transported and for associated damages to natural resources.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws regulate the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of wastes, specifically under RCRA those designated as “hazardous wastes.” The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for these wastes and impose numerous regulations upon the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of them. Our operations generate wastes that are subject to RCRA and comparable state statutes. Furthermore, wastes generated by our operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may be designated in the future as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes and, therefore, may be subject to more rigorous and costly treatment, storage and disposal requirements. Governmental agencies (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to comply with RCRA requirements, seeking administrative, civil, or criminal penalties and injunctive relief, to compel us to abate a solid or hazardous waste situation that presents an imminent or substantial endangerment to health or the environment.

Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes and fill materials into waters of the United States. Under the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws, the government (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to comply with Clean Water Act requirements and enforce compliance through civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and of other pollutants. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and subject to injunctive relief.
Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended and comparable state and local laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Governmental agencies (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to strictly comply with air pollution regulations or permits and generally enforce compliance through administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions, resulting in fines, injunctive relief (which could include requiring us to forego construction, modification or operation of sources of air pollutants) and imprisonment. While we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Greenhouse Gas Regulation. More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (GHGs) may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. The EPA has begun to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the CAA. The EPA adopted rules to permit GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting programs including the “Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule,” requiring that the largest sources first obtain permits for GHG emissions. The United States Supreme Court, however, ruled that the EPA did not have the authority to require permits for GHG emissions and also did not have the authority to adopt that rule. The Court did hold that if a source required a permit under the program because of other pollutants, the EPA had the authority to require that the source demonstrate that it would use the best available control technology to minimize GHG emissions that exceeded a minimal amount.
 
Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislation program addressing GHGs, the EPA is using its existing regulatory authority to promulgate regulations requiring reduction in GHG emissions from various categories of sources, starting with fossil fuel-fired power plants. There is a great deal of uncertainty as to how and when additional federal regulation of GHGs might take place. Some members of Congress have expressed the intention to promote legislation to curb the EPA’s authority to regulate GHGs. In addition to federal regulation, a number of states, individually and regionally, and localities also are considering implementing or have implemented GHG regulatory programs. These regional and state initiatives may result in so–called cap–and–trade programs, under which overall GHG emissions are limited and GHG emission “allowances” are then allocated and sold to and between persons subject to the program. These and possibly other regulatory requirements could result in our incurring material expenses to comply, for example by being required to purchase or to surrender allowances for GHGs resulting from other operations or otherwise being required to control or reduce emissions.
 
Occupational Safety. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and its regulations. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA’s community right-to-know regulations and similar state programs may require us to organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements.
Foreign Regulation. We are subject to various laws, regulations and ordinances to protect the environment, human health and safety promulgated by the governmental authorities in Mexico, Europe, Singapore, and in other countries where we do business. Each country has laws and regulations concerning waste treatment, storage and disposal, discharges to waterways, air emissions and workplace safety and worker health. Their respective regulatory authorities are given broad authority to enforce compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and can require that operations be suspended pending completion of required remedial action.
Licenses, Permits and Product Registrations. Certain licenses, permits and product registrations are required for our products and operations in the United States, and in other countries where we do business. The licenses, permits and product registrations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by governmental authorities. In the United States in particular, producers and distributors of chemicals such as penta and creosote are subject to registration and notification requirements under federal law (including under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”) and the Toxic Substances Control Act, and comparable state law) in order to sell those products in the United States. Compliance with these laws has had, and in the future will continue to have, a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under FIFRA, the law’s registration system requires an ongoing submission to the EPA of substantial scientific research and testing data regarding the chemistry and toxicology of pesticide products by manufacturers.
