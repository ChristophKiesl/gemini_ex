Background
We are one of the world's largest brewers and have a diverse portfolio of owned and partner brands, including core brands Carling, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Molson Canadian and Staropramen, as well as craft and specialty beers such as the Blue Moon Brewing Company brands, the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company brands, Creemore Springs, Cobra and Doom Bar. With centuries of brewing heritage, we have been crafting high-quality, innovative products with the purpose of delighting the world's beer drinkers and with the ambition to be the first choice for our consumers and customers. Our success depends on our ability to make our products available to meet a wide range of consumer segments and occasions.
Molson and Coors were founded in 1786 and 1873, respectively. Our commitment to producing the highest quality beers is a key part of our heritage and remains so to this day. Our brands are designed to appeal to a wide range of consumer tastes, styles and price preferences. Our largest markets are the U.S., Canada and Europe.
Coors was incorporated in June 1913 under the laws of the state of Colorado. In October 2003, Coors merged with and into Adolph Coors Company, a Delaware corporation. In February 2005, upon completion of the Merger, Adolph Coors Company (the Delaware corporation) changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company. 
Acquisition
During 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV’s (“ABI”) announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SABMiller plc ("SABMiller") (“ABI/SABMiller transaction”) and concurrently, on November 11, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”) with ABI to acquire, contingent upon the closing of the ABI/SABMiller transaction, all of SABMiller’s 58% economic interest and 50% voting interest in MillerCoors and all trademarks, contracts and other assets primarily related to the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for $12.0 billion in cash, subject to downward adjustment as described in the Purchase Agreement (the "Acquisition"). On October 11, 2016, the Acquisition was completed and MillerCoors, previously a joint venture between MCBC and SABMiller, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC and as a result, MCBC now owns 100% of the outstanding equity and voting interests of MillerCoors. 
Industry Overview
The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years, becoming an increasingly global beer market. The industry was previously founded on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export, license and partnership arrangements. More recently, it has become increasingly complex, as the consolidation of brewers has occurred globally, resulting in fewer major global market participants. In addition to the acquisitive element of this industry consolidation, the market continues to utilize export, license and partnership arrangements; however, these are often with the same global competitors that make up the majority of the market. This industry consolidation has resulted in a small number of large global brewers representing the majority of the worldwide beer market. At the same time, smaller local brewers within certain established markets are experiencing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on locally-produced, regionally-sourced products. As the beer industry continues its evolution of consolidation and diversification of its products to meet consumer demand with broadening preferences, large global brewers are uniquely positioned to leverage the scale, depth of product portfolio and industry knowledge to continue to lead the market forward.

Our Segments
In 2016, we operated the following segments: the U.S., Canada, Europe and MCI. A separate operating team manages each segment and each segment manufactures, markets, and sells beer and other beverage products. 
 As result of the Acquisition, effective January 1, 2017, various European markets including Sweden, Spain, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, which are currently reported under our MCI segment, will move to our Europe segment. Additionally, effective January 1, 2017, the results of the MillerCoors Puerto Rico business, which are currently reported as part of the U.S. segment, will be reported within the MCI segment. 
See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3, "Segment Reporting" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ("Notes") for information relating to our segments and operations, including financial and geographic information. For certain risks attendant to our operations, refer to Part I—Item 1A Risk Factors.
United States Segment
We are the second largest brewer by volume in the U.S., selling approximately 25% of the total 2016 U.S. brewing industry shipments (excluding exports). MillerCoors was formed on July 1, 2008, as a joint venture between MCBC and SABMiller. Each party contributed its U.S. and Puerto Rico businesses and related operating assets and certain liabilities. Prior to the Acquisition which was completed on October 11, 2016, MCBC owned a 50% voting and 42% economic interest in MillerCoors, and MillerCoors was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Following the completion of the Acquisition, MillerCoors became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC and its results were fully consolidated by MCBC prospectively beginning on October 11, 2016.
Sales and Distribution
In the United States, beer is generally distributed through a three-tier system consisting of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. A national network of approximately 400 independent distributors and one owned distributor, Coors Distribution Company, purchases MillerCoors' products and distributes them to retail accounts. 
Channels
In the United States, the on-premise channel, which includes sales in bars and restaurants, declined approximately 3% in 2016. On-premise declines were driven by a reduction in visits as consumers shifted their on-premise occasions to off-premise. 
The off-premise channel includes sales in convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores and other retail outlets. The off-premise channel volumes declined approximately 1% in 2016 versus prior year. 
We wholly own one distributorship, which handled less than 2% of our total owned and non-owned volume in 2016.
The following table reflects the percentage of our U.S. segment's sales volume by channel over the last five years.

 | Sales volume by channel
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012
On-premise | 16 | % | | 17 | % | 17 | % | | 18 | % | 18 | %
Off-premise | 84 | % | | 83 | % | 83 | % | | 82 | % | 82 | %

Manufacturing, Production and Packaging
Brewing Raw Materials
We use high quality ingredients to brew our products. We malt a portion of our production requirements, using barley purchased under annual contracts from independent farmers located in the western United States. Other barley, malt, and cereal grains are purchased from suppliers primarily in the U.S. Hops are purchased from suppliers in the U.S., Europe and New Zealand. We both own and lease water rights to provide for and to sustain brewing operations in case of a prolonged drought in 
5

the regions where we have operations. We do not currently anticipate future difficulties in accessing water or agricultural products used in our brewing process in the near term.
Brewing and Container Facilities
We currently operate seven large breweries, five craft breweries, two container operations and one cidery. MillerCoors closed its Eden, North Carolina brewery in September of 2016. We import Molson brands from Molson Coors Canada and Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Pilsner Urquell, Grolsch and other import brands formerly from SABMiller with purchases now from Asahi and ABI.
Packaging Materials
Approximately 66% of U.S. products sold were packaged in aluminum cans or bottles in 2016. A portion of the aluminum containers were purchased from Rocky Mountain Metal Container ("RMMC"), a joint venture between MillerCoors and Ball Corporation ("Ball"), whose production facilities, which are leased from us, are located near our brewery in Golden, Colorado. In addition to the supply agreement with RMMC, we have a supply agreement with Ball to purchase cans and ends in excess of what is supplied through RMMC. In 2011, MillerCoors signed a 10-year contract extension with Ball to extend the RMMC joint venture agreement along with the can and end purchase agreements, both of which will expire December 31, 2021. Approximately 24% of U.S. products sold in 2016 were packaged in glass bottles, of which a portion was provided by Rocky Mountain Bottle Company ("RMBC"), a joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. ("Owens"). In 2015, MillerCoors signed a 10-year contract extension with Owens to extend the RMBC joint venture agreement which expires July 31, 2025. MillerCoors and Owens entered into a supply agreement effective January 1, 2015, for requirements in excess of RMBC's production. Approximately 8% of U.S. production volume sold in 2016 was packaged in half, quarter, and one-sixth barrel stainless steel kegs. A limited number of kegs are purchased each year, and there is no long-term supply agreement. Approximately 2% of U.S. products sold in 2016 were in plastic bottles. Crowns, labels, corrugate and paperboard are purchased from a small number of sources unique to each product. In recent years, we have experienced a slight shift in the allocation among different packaging types toward aluminum cans and bottles and away from glass bottles. In general, aluminum cans allow for lower packaging costs compared to most other types of packaging materials. We do not currently anticipate future difficulties in accessing packaging products in the near term.
Contract Manufacturing
We have an agreement to brew, package and ship products for Pabst Brewing Company through June 2020. Additionally, the U.S. segment produces beer for our Canada and MCI segments. As a result of the Acquisition, we produce a small amount of beer for an affiliate of ABI under an Amended and Restated Brewing Agreement ("Brewing Agreement") in which we continue to produce Redd’s and Foster’s products for the ABI affiliate for sale outside of the U.S. This Brewing Agreement is temporary in nature and has a contractual term of 18 months from the close of the Acquisition.
Seasonality of the Business
Total industry volume in the U.S. is sensitive to factors such as weather, changes in demographics, consumer preferences and drinking occasions. Weather conditions consisting of high temperatures and extended periods of warm weather favor increased consumption of our products, while unseasonably cool or wet weather, especially during the summer months, adversely affects our sales volumes and net sales. Accordingly, consumption of beer in the U.S. is seasonal, with approximately 38% of industry sales volume typically occurring during the warmer months from May through August.
Known Trends and Competitive Conditions
2016 U.S. Beer Industry Overview
The beer industry in the United States is highly competitive, and the two largest brewers, ABI and MillerCoors together represented the majority of the market in 2016. The formation of MillerCoors in 2008 created a stronger U.S. presence for MCBC with the scale, operational efficiency and distribution platform to compete more effectively in the U.S. marketplace and we expect to continue our U.S. presence through the MillerCoors business which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC on October 11, 2016, as a result of the Acquisition. Growing or even maintaining market share has required significant investments in marketing. From 1998 to 2008, the U.S. beer industry shipments annual growth rate approximated 1%, compared with declines ranging from 1% to 2% in each of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. With ideal weather conditions, industry volumes improved slightly in 2012, growing approximately 1%. However, in 2013 the industry saw a decline of less than 1%, and in 2014, the industry grew slightly, by less than 1%. In 2015 and 2016, the industry slightly declined by approximately 1%.
6

Overall declines in the U.S. beer industry volumes since 2009 have been partially attributed to per capita beer consumption declines as consumer preferences shifted to higher alcohol, full calorie beers, as well as spirits and wine. Competition from outside of the beer category continues to be a challenge and despite recent improvement in economic indicators, the industry is still recovering from multiple years of challenging economic conditions such as with higher rates of unemployment, declining labor participation rates and lower consumer confidence that negatively affected the purchasing behaviors of legal age key beer drinkers. 
The following table summarizes the estimated percentage market share by volume of beer (including adjacencies, such as cider) and other alcohol beverages as a component of the overall U.S. alcohol market over the last five years. We anticipate that 2016 data, when available, will reflect a continuation of the recent consumer trends. Note that percentages reflect estimates based on market data currently available.

 | 2015 | | 2014 | | 2013 | 2012 | | 2011
Beer | 51 | % | | 51 | % | 52 | % | | 53 | % | 53 | %
Other alcohol beverages | 49 | % | | 49 | % | 48 | % | | 47 | % | 47 | %

Our Competitive Position
Our portfolio of beers competes with numerous above-premium, premium, and economy brands. These competing brands are produced by international, national, regional and local brewers. We compete most directly with ABI brands, but also compete with imported and craft beer brands. The following table summarizes the estimated percentage share of the U.S. beer market represented by MillerCoors, ABI and all other brewers over the last five years. Note that current year percentages reflect estimates based on market data currently available. 

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012
MillerCoors' share | 25 | % | | 26 | % | 27 | % | | 28 | % | 29 | %
ABI's share | 44 | % | | 45 | % | 46 | % | | 47 | % | 48 | %
Others' share | 31 | % | | 29 | % | 27 | % | | 25 | % | 23 | %

Our products also compete with other alcohol beverages, including wine and spirits, and thus their competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories. Driven by increased spirits advertising along with increased wine and spirits sales execution, sales of wine and spirits have grown faster than sales of beer in recent years, resulting in a reduction in the beer segment's lead in the overall alcohol beverage market.
Regulation
The U.S. beer business is regulated by federal, state, and local governments. These regulations govern many parts of our operations, including brewing, marketing and advertising, transportation, distributor relationships, sales, and environmental issues. To operate our facilities, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including the U.S. Treasury Department, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, state alcohol regulatory agencies, and state and federal environmental agencies.
Governmental entities also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In 2016, excise taxes on malt beverages were approximately $15 per hectoliter sold on a reported basis. State excise taxes are levied in specific states at varying rates. Refer to Part I—Item 1A, Risk Factors for risks associated with the regulatory environment in the U.S.
Canada Segment
We are Canada's second-largest brewer by volume and North America's oldest beer company. Our market share of the Canada beer market in 2016 was approximately 34%. We brew, market, sell and distribute a wide variety of beer brands nationally. Our portfolio has leading brands in all major product and price segments. Our focus and investment is on Canada core brands, primarily Coors Light and Molson Canadian, as well as other key owned brands, including Coors Banquet, Creemore Springs, Granville Island, Molson Dry, Molson Export, Old Style Pilsner and Rickard's and strategic distribution partnerships, including those with Heineken. In 2016, Coors Light had an approximate 11% market share and was the second largest selling beer brand in Canada, and Molson Canadian had an approximate 6% market share and was the fourth largest selling beer in Canada. As a result of the Acquisition, the Miller brands returned to our Canada business. 
7

The Canada segment also includes our partnership arrangements related to the distribution of beer in Ontario, Brewers' Retail Inc. ("BRI"), and in the Western provinces, Brewers' Distributor Ltd. ("BDL"). BRI and BDL are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The majority of ownership in BRI resides with MCC, Labatt Breweries of Canada LP (a subsidiary of ABI) and Sleeman Breweries Ltd. (a subsidiary of Sapporo International). BDL is jointly owned by MCC and Labatt Breweries of Canada LP.
Sales and Distribution
In Canada, provincial governments regulate the beer industry, particularly with regard to the pricing, mark-up, container management, sale, distribution and advertising of beer. Distribution and the retail sale of alcohol products involve a wide range and varied degree of Canadian government control through their respective provincial liquor boards. See below discussion for details by province. 
Channels
In Canada, the on-premise channel includes sales in bars and restaurants. In Ontario and Western Canada, MCC uses jointly-owned distribution systems to deliver beer to on-premise customers along with products from Labatt Breweries of Canada LP and Sleeman Breweries Ltd., and other small participating brewers. In Quebec and Eastern Canada, MCC primarily delivers directly. The on-premise channel, and relationships with customers, are highly regulated and the regulations differ significantly across different provincial jurisdictions.
The off-premise channel includes sales to convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores and other specialty retail outlets, including "The Beer Store" in Ontario, which is the world's largest beer retailer and is co-owned by Ontario's three largest brewers. The off-premise channel is highly regulated and differs significantly across different provincial jurisdictions. 
The following table reflects the percentage of our Canada segment's sales volume by channel over the last five years.

 | Sales volume by channel
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012
On-premise | 19 | % | | 19 | % | 19 | % | | 18 | % | 18 | %
Off-premise | 81 | % | | 81 | % | 81 | % | | 82 | % | 82 | %

Province of Ontario
In Ontario, beer is primarily purchased at retail outlets operated by BRI, at government-regulated retail outlets operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, at approved agents of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, at certain licensed grocery stores, or at any bar, restaurant, or tavern licensed by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario to sell alcohol for on-premise consumption. The BRI retail outlets operate under The Beer Store name. Brewers may deliver directly to BRI's outlets or may choose to use BRI's distribution centers to access retail stores in Ontario, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario system, the grocery channel and licensed establishments.
We, together with certain other brewers, have historically participated in the ownership of BRI in proportion to provincial market share relative to other brewers in the ownership group. Effective January 1, 2016, we, along with the other owners of BRI and the Province of Ontario, agreed to revise the ownership structure of BRI. The new BRI shareholder agreement (“New Shareholder Agreement”) adjusted the existing BRI ownership structure to allow all other small and large Ontario based brewers the ability to participate in the ownership of BRI. As part of this change, the board of directors of BRI has been expanded to include representation for these new ownership groups, as well as independent director representation. The new owners are subject to the same fee structure as the current owners, with the exception of smaller brewers, who have discounted fees, as they are not required to fund certain costs associated with pension obligations. BRI operates on a cash neutral basis under the new ownership structure. BRI also converted all existing capital stock into a new share class, as well as created a separate new share class to facilitate new and existing brewer participation and governance. While governance and board of director participation continues to have the ability to fluctuate based on market share relative to the other owners, our equity interest has become fixed under the New Shareholder Agreement. 
Province of Québec
In Québec, the distribution and sale of beer is governed by the Quebec Alcohol Corporation ("SAQ"). Beer is distributed to retail outlets directly by each brewer or through approved independent agents. We are the agent for the licensed brands we distribute. The brewer or agent distributes the products to permit holders for retail sales for on-premise consumption. Québec retail sales for off-premise consumption are made through grocery and convenience stores, as well as government operated outlets. 
8

Province of British Columbia
In British Columbia, the government's Liquor Distribution Branch controls the regulatory elements of distribution of all alcohol products in the province. BDL, which we co-own with ABI, manages the distribution of our products throughout British Columbia. Consumers can purchase beer at any Liquor Distribution Branch retail outlet, at any independently owned and licensed retail store or at any licensed establishment for on-premise consumption. Establishments licensed primarily for on-premise alcohol sales may also be licensed for off-premise consumption.
Province of Alberta
In Alberta, the distribution of beer is managed by independent private warehousing and shipping companies or by a government sponsored system in the case of U.S. sourced products. All sales of liquor in Alberta are made through retail outlets licensed by the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission or licensees, such as bars, hotels and restaurants. BDL manages the distribution of our products in Alberta.
Other Provinces
Our products are distributed in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan through local liquor boards. Manitoba and Saskatchewan also have licensed private retailers. BDL manages the distribution of our products in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In the Maritime Provinces (other than Newfoundland), local liquor boards distribute and sell our products. In Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, government liquor commissioners manage the distribution and sale of our products.
Manufacturing, Production and Packaging
Brewing Raw Materials
We select global suppliers in order to procure high quality materials and services at the lowest prices available. We also use hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of volatility in certain commodities and foreign exchange markets.
We source barley malt from one primary provider, from which we have a committed supply through 2021. Hops are purchased from a variety of global suppliers in the U.S. and Europe through contracts that vary in length based on market conditions and cover our supply requirements through 2019. Other starch brewing adjuncts are sourced from two main suppliers, both in North America. Water used in the brewing process is from local sources in the communities where our breweries operate. We do not currently anticipate future difficulties in accessing water or agricultural products used in our brewing process in the near term.
Brewing and Packaging Facilities
We operate seven breweries, strategically located throughout Canada. These locations brew and package all owned and certain licensed brands sold in, and exported from, Canada. See Item 2, "Properties" for further detail.
Packaging Materials
We single source glass bottles and have a committed supply through December 2019. We source lids and cans from two primary providers with contracts ending February 2017 and December 2023. We currently utilize a hedging program for aluminum requirements and related transportation and storage costs in Canada. The distribution systems in each province generally provide the collection network for returnable bottles and aluminum cans. The standard bottle for beer brewed in Canada is the 341 ml returnable bottle and represents the vast majority of our bottle sales. Bottle sales continue to decline as we have experienced a shift in consumers' preference toward aluminum cans. This standard returnable bottle requires significant investment behind our returnable bottle inventory and bottling equipment. Therefore, the trend away from returnable bottles could result in higher fixed cost deleverage related to these assets and an ultimate decreased need for the assets that support this packaging, which could adversely impact profitability. A limited number of kegs are purchased every year, and we have no long-term supply commitment. Crowns are currently sourced from two suppliers with contracts through February 2017 and December 2018. Paperboard and labels are currently sourced from one supplier with contracts through December 2017 and December 2021, respectively. Corrugate is purchased from a small number of sources with contracts through December 2017. We do not currently anticipate future difficulties in accessing any of our required packaging materials in the near term. The following table reflects the percentage of total sales volumes (excluding imports) for each of the last five years by type of packaging material.

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012
Aluminum cans | 56 | % | | 53 | % | 49 | % | | 46 | % | 42 | %
Bottles | 34 | % | | 37 | % | 40 | % | | 43 | % | 47 | %
Stainless steel kegs | 10 | % | | 10 | % | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 11 | %

Contract Manufacturing
We have an agreement with North American Breweries, Inc. ("NAB") to brew, package and ship certain Labatt brands to the U.S. market through 2020. We also have an agreement with Asahi to brew and package Asahi Super Dry and Asahi Select to the U.S. market through early 2017. We are currently finalizing negotiations with Asahi for an extension of this contract through early 2020.
Seasonality of Business
Total industry volume in Canada is sensitive to factors such as weather, changes in demographics, consumer preferences and drinking occasions. Weather conditions consisting of high temperatures and extended periods of warm weather favor increased consumption of our products, while unseasonably cool or wet weather, especially during the summer months, adversely affects our sales volumes and net sales. Accordingly, consumption of beer in Canada is seasonal, with approximately 41% of industry sales volume typically occurring during the warmer months from May through August.
Known Trends and Competitive Conditions
2016 Canada Beer Industry Overview
The Canadian brewing industry is a mature market and ABI and MCBC are the two largest brewers. It is characterized by aggressive competition for volume and market share from regional brewers, microbrewers and certain foreign brewers, as well as our main domestic competitor. These competitive pressures require significant annual investment in marketing and selling activities. In 2016, the Ontario and Québec markets accounted for approximately 60% of the total beer market in Canada.
There are three major beer price segments: above premium, which includes craft and most imports; premium, which includes the majority of domestic brands and the light sub-segment; and value (below premium). Since 2001, the premium beer segment in Canada has gradually lost volume to the above premium and value segments. 
Recently, the beer industry has been weak, with declines in three of the last five years. Aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages have been the main contributors to the declining state of the beer industry.
The following table summarizes the estimated percentage market share by volume of beer (including adjacencies, such as cider) and other alcohol beverages as a component of the overall Canadian alcohol market over the last five years, for which data is currently available. We anticipate that 2016 data, when available, will reflect a continuation of the recent consumer trends. Note that percentages reflect estimates based on market data currently available. 

 | 2015 | | 2014 | | 2013 | 2012 | | 2011
Beer | 48 | % | | 48 | % | 48 | % | | 49 | % | 50 | %
Other alcohol beverages | 52 | % | | 52 | % | 52 | % | | 51 | % | 50 | %

Our Competitive Position
Our brands compete with competitor beer brands and other alcohol beverages, including wine and spirits, and thus our competitive position is affected by consumer preferences among these other categories. Our brand portfolio gives us strong representation in all major beer segments.
The Canada brewing industry is composed principally of two major brewers, MCBC and ABI. The following table summarizes the estimated percentage share of the Canadian beer market represented by MCBC, ABI and all other brewers over the last five years. Note that the sum of the percentages below may not equal 100% due to rounding. Current year percentages reflect estimates based on market data currently available. 
10


 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012
MCBC's share(1) | 34 | % | | 34 | % | 37 | % | | 39 | % | 40 | %
ABI's share(1) | 43 | % | | 43 | % | 43 | % | | 40 | % | 41 | %
Others' share | 24 | % | | 23 | % | 21 | % | | 20 | % | 19 | %


(1) | The decrease in MCBC's share in 2015 was largely driven by the loss of the contract with Miller Brewing Company ("Miller"), under which we had exclusive rights to distribute certain Miller brands in Canada and was terminated effective March 2015. As a result of the Acquisition, beginning October 11, 2016, these Miller brands returned to our Canada business. The decrease in MCBC's share and increase in ABI's share from 2013 to 2014 is primarily the result of ABI's acquisition of Grupo Modelo S.A.B. de C.V. ("Modelo") in 2013. Subsequent to the termination of Modelo Molson Imports, L.P. ("MMI"), our joint venture with Modelo in Canada, in the first quarter of 2014, the Modelo brands are now distributed by ABI in Canada.

Regulation
In Canada, provincial governments regulate the production, marketing, distribution, selling and pricing of beer (including the establishment of minimum prices), and impose commodity taxes and license fees in relation to the production, distribution and sale of beer. In addition, the federal government regulates the advertising, labeling, quality control, and international trade of beer, and also imposes commodity taxes on both domestically produced and imported beer. In 2016, our Canada segment excise taxes were approximately $51 per hectoliter sold on a reported basis. Further, certain bilateral and multilateral treaties entered into by the federal government, provincial governments and certain foreign governments, especially with the United States, affect the Canadian beer industry. 
We, along with other owners of BRI, entered into a new beer framework agreement with the Province of Ontario on September 22, 2015, which became effective January 1, 2016. Refer to Part I—Item 1A, Risk Factors for risks associated with the regulatory environment in Canada.
Europe Segment
We are the second largest brewer by volume, on a combined basis, within the European countries in which we operate, with an approximate aggregate 20% market share (excluding factored products) in 2016. The majority of our European segment sales are in the U.K., Croatia, Czech Republic and Romania. Our portfolio includes beers that have the largest share in their respective countries, such as Carling in the U.K., Ozujsko in Croatia and Niksicko in Montenegro. We have beers that rank in the top three in market share in their respective segments throughout the region, including Staropramen in Czech Republic, Bergenbier in Romania, Jelen in Serbia, Kamenitza in Bulgaria and Borsodi in Hungary. Additionally, as a result of the Acquisition, we began selling Miller Genuine Draft in various European countries. We also brew and distribute Beck's, Lowenbrau, Spaten and Stella Artois under license agreements with ABI companies, and beginning in January 2015, we distribute certain of the Modelo brands throughout the Central European countries in which we operate. Our Europe segment includes our consolidated joint venture arrangements for the production and distribution of Grolsch and Cobra brands in the U.K. and Republic of Ireland and factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies, but sold and delivered to retail by us). In 2015, we purchased the Rekorderlig cider brand distribution rights in the U.K. and Republic of Ireland and also sold our U.K. malting facility. Additionally, in 2015, we closed a brewery in the U.K. and terminated our distribution agreement with Carlsberg whereby it held the exclusive distribution rights for the Staropramen brand in the U.K. As a result, we repatriated the Staropramen brand back to the U.K. at the end of 2015.
In the second half of 2016, we entered into a long-term partnership agreement with Dutch brewer, Bavaria. The agreement gives us the exclusive rights in the on- and off-premise channels to the sales, distribution and customer marketing of Bavaria and its portfolio of brands in the U.K. Additionally, effective January 1, 2017, various European markets including Sweden, Spain, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, which were previously presented within our MCI segment will be included within our Europe segment. 
Sales and Distribution
In Europe, beer is generally distributed through either a two-tier system consisting of manufacturers and retailers, or a three-tier system consisting of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Distribution activities for both the on-premise and off-premise channels are conducted primarily by third-party logistics providers. Most of our beer in the U.K. is sold directly to retailers. We have an agreement with Tradeteam Ltd. ("Tradeteam", a subsidiary of DHL) to provide the distribution of our products throughout the U.K. through 2023. We utilize several hundred third-party logistics providers across our Central European operations. We also conduct a small amount of secondary distribution in Czech Republic utilizing our own fleet of vehicles. It is also common in the U.K. for brewers to distribute beer, wine, spirits, and other products owned and produced by 
11

other companies, which we refer to as factored brands, to the on-premise channel (bars and restaurants). Approximately 19% of our Europe segment net sales in 2016 represented factored brands. In addition, we have an agreement with Heineken through December 2019, whereby they sell, market and distribute Coors Light in Republic of Ireland. 
Channels
In Europe, the on-premise channel includes sales to pubs and restaurants. The installation and maintenance of draught beer dispensing equipment in the on-premise channel is generally the responsibility of the brewer. Accordingly, we own refrigeration units and other equipment used to dispense beer from kegs to consumers that are used in on-premise outlets. This includes beer lines, cooling equipment, taps, and counter mounts. 
The off-premise channel includes sales to supermarkets, convenience stores, liquor stores, distributors, and wholesalers. The off-premise channel has become increasingly concentrated among a small number of super-store chains, placing increasing downward pressure on beer pricing.
Generally, over the years, volumes in Europe have shifted from the higher margin on-premise channel, where products are consumed in pubs and restaurants, to the lower margin off-premise channel, also referred to as the "take-home" market. In 2016, approximately 40% of sales were on-premise and 60% were off-premise. Consistent with prior years, the on-premise channel has continued to experience declines from shifting consumer preference to off-premise partially due to smoking bans in many countries. The off-premise channel continues to be challenged by competitive pricing. 
Similar to other brewers, we utilize loans in securing supply relationships with customers in the on-premise market in the U.K. These loans can be granted at below-market rates of interest, with the outlet purchasing beer at lower-than-average discount levels to compensate. We reclassify a portion of sales revenue to interest income to reflect the economic substance of these loans. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes for additional information.
Manufacturing, Production and Packaging
Brewing Raw Materials
We use high quality water, barley, malt and hops to brew our products. During 2016, our malt requirements were sourced from third party suppliers. We have multiple agreements with various suppliers that cover almost all of our total required malt, with terms ending in 2019 through 2025. Hops are purchased under various contracts with suppliers in Germany, the U.S. and the U.K., which cover our requirements through 2017. Adjuncts are purchased under various contracts with local producers, which are typically crop year contracts commencing in October of each year. Water used in the brewing process is sourced from various wells and through water rights and supply contracts. We do not currently anticipate future difficulties in accessing required water or agricultural products used in our brewing process in the near term.
Brewing and Packaging Facilities
We operate twelve breweries in Europe, which brew and package brands sold in Europe. As part of the continued strategic review of our European supply chain network, in 2015 we closed our brewing facilities in Alton, Hampshire, U.K. and in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Additionally, in 2015, we announced the planned closure of our Burton South brewery in the U.K. which is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. See Item 2, "Properties" for additional information. 
Packaging Materials
Approximately 29% of our Europe volumes sold in 2016 were packaged in bottles, with a significant majority in returnable bottles sourced under various agreements with third party suppliers. Kegs and casks comprised approximately 28% of volume sold in Europe in 2016. Cans represent approximately 26% of our Europe volumes sold in 2016. We have long-term contracts with four providers for our required supply of cans. Approximately 17% of our Europe volume sold in 2016 consisted of products packaged in recyclable plastic containers for which we are currently negotiating agreements for our 2017 requirements with various manufacturers in the region. Crowns, labels and corrugate are purchased from sources unique to each category. We do not currently foresee future difficulties in accessing these or other packaging materials in the near term.
Seasonality of Business
In Europe, the beer industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations primarily influenced by holidays, weather and by certain major televised sporting events. Weather conditions consisting of high temperatures and extended periods of warm weather favor increased consumption of our products, while unseasonably cool or wet weather, especially during the summer months, adversely affects our sales volumes and net sales. Accordingly, the peak selling seasons typically occur during the summer and during the Christmas and New Year holiday season.

Known Trends and Competitive Conditions
2016 Europe Beer Industry Overview
We estimate that the Europe beer market decreased by approximately 1% in 2016, driven by decreased beer consumption versus last year in some of the largest regions in which we operate. Since 2010, the off-premise market share has increased in our European markets from 55% to nearly 60% of total volume, and the on-premise market share has declined from 45% to approximately 40%. Europe beer industry retail shipments have declined by approximately 1% to 2% yearly since 2011, with the exception of 2015 where we saw a recovery of approximately 2%. These market fluctuations are consistent with the fluctuations within the overall alcohol market in each of the respective years.
The following table summarizes the estimated percentage market share by volume of beer (including adjacencies, such as cider) and other alcohol beverages as a component of the overall European alcohol market, within the countries in which we have production facilities, over the last five years, for which data is currently available. We anticipate that 2016 data, when available, will reflect a continuation of the recent consumer trends. Note that percentages reflect estimates based on market data currently available.

 | 2015 | | 2014 | | 2013 | 2012 | | 2011
Beer | 36 | % | | 36 | % | 36 | % | | 36 | % | 36 | %
Other alcohol beverages | 64 | % | | 64 | % | 64 | % | | 64 | % | 64 | %

Our Competitive Position
Our beers compete not only with similar products from competitors, but also with other alcohol beverages, including wines, spirits and ciders. We believe our brand portfolio gives us strong representation in all major beer categories. 
In European countries where we currently operate, our primary competitors are Heineken, Carlsberg and ABI. During 2016, Asahi acquired brands previously owned by SABMiller in Western Europe and announced the acquisition of brands previously owned by SABMiller in Central and Eastern Europe. The following table summarizes our estimated percentage share of the beer market within the European countries where we operate and our primary competitors over the last five years. Note that current year percentages reflect estimates based on market data currently available.

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012
MCBC's share | 20 | % | | 20 | % | 20 | % | | 20 | % | 20 | %
Primary competitors' share | 57 | % | | 57 | % | 59 | % | | 59 | % | 60 | %
Others' share | 23 | % | | 23 | % | 21 | % | | 21 | % | 20 | %

Regulation
Each country that is part of our Europe segment is either a member of the European Union ("EU") or a current candidate to join, with the exception of Bosnia, which is a potential candidate, and, as such, there are similarities in the regulations that apply to many parts of our Europe segment's operations and products, including brewing, food safety, labeling and packaging, marketing and advertising, environmental, health and safety, employment and data protection regulations. To operate breweries and conduct our business in Europe, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits and licenses from various governmental agencies. 
In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. voted in favor of the U.K. leaving the EU. Negotiations on exit terms may take two years to complete once the U.K. formally initiates its exit from the EU and negotiations on new trade agreements may take longer. Because the terms of the exit are unknown, we may face regulatory uncertainty and we may need to quickly adapt to regulatory changes.
Each country's government levies excise taxes on all alcohol beverages. With the exception of Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia, all countries' laws on excise taxes are consistent with the directives of the EU. With the exception of Serbia, where a flat excise per hectoliter is used, all European countries use similar measurements based on either alcohol by volume or Plato degrees. In 2016, the excise taxes for our Europe segment, excluding a provision for indirect taxes related to the assessments discussed in Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes were approximately $43 per hectoliter on a reported basis. Refer to Part I—Item 1A, Risk Factors for risks associated with the regulatory environment in Europe.

Molson Coors International Segment
The objective of MCI is to grow and expand our business and brand portfolio in new and existing markets, including emerging markets, outside the U.S., Canada and Europe segments. The focus of MCI includes Latin America (including Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America and excluding Puerto Rico through December 31, 2016, as it was part of the U.S. segment as discussed above), Asia Pacific and Africa. Various European markets were a focus of MCI through December 31, 2016, prior to the segment change discussed below. The MCI portfolio of beers competes within the above-premium category in most of our markets. Our principal competitors include large global brewers, as well as local brewers. As MCI's objective is to grow and expand our business, we are developing scale and building market share in the countries where we operate. Many of the markets in which we operate are considered emerging beer markets, with other brewers controlling the majority of the market share. Our beers compete not only with similar products from competitors, but also with other alcohol beverages, including wines, spirits, and ciders, and thus our competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories. Effective January 1, 2017, the results of operations in our various European markets including Sweden, Spain, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, currently included within MCI, will be presented within our Europe segment. Additionally, the Puerto Rico business, which is currently presented within the U.S. segment will be presented within MCI.
Latin America Business
In Latin America, Coors Light, Coors 1873 and Blue Moon are exported from the U.S. and sold through agreements with independent distributors. We also have an exclusive licensing agreement with Heineken to brew and distribute Coors Light in Mexico and licensing agreements with other distributors for the manufacturing and distribution of Coors Light and Coors 1873 in Chile and Colombia. 
Asia Pacific Business
Our operations in the Asia region are based in India, Japan, China and Australia. 
Our business in India consists of our joint venture which gives us a majority share and operational control of Molson Coors Cobra India Ltd., based in the state of Bihar, India, as well as Molson Coors India Private Ltd. (formally known as Mount Shivalik Breweries Ltd.), with its largest operations in the states of Punjab and Haryana, India, which we acquired in 2015. Our consolidated India business produces, markets and sells a beer portfolio consisting of Thunderbolt, Iceberg 9000 and Carling Strong in select Indian states. We own and operate three breweries in India, where we use high quality ingredients to brew our products, which are sourced through various contracts with local suppliers. We do not currently anticipate any significant disruption in the supply of these raw materials or brewing inputs in the near term. During the second quarter of 2016, a complete prohibition of the sale and consumption of all forms of alcohol in the state of Bihar was implemented. The expected length of the prohibition is unclear but we continue to monitor legal proceedings impacting the regulatory environment as it relates to our ability to resume operations in the state. As a result of this ban, our Molson Coors Cobra India business is currently not operating and is idled pending any future change in law or regulation. This ban does not impact our Mount Shivalik business, which operates outside of Bihar, India. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for further details.
In Japan our focus is on the marketing and selling of the Blue Moon, Coors Light and Zima brands. We also have a contract with ABI to sell and distribute the Modelo brands, however, we have received notification of ABI's intention to terminate this contract in June 2017. Our brands are imported into Japan and are sold through independent wholesalers to both the on-premise and off-premise channels. 
Our China business sells the Coors family of brands through a trade distribution model. 
Our Australia business consists of a partnership with Coca Cola Amatil (CCA), which manufactures and distributes Blue Moon, Coors and other products for us. 
Europe Business
Our Europe business consists of both export and license businesses. Our Europe export business focuses on expanding the reach of our international brands which are exported from our breweries in the U.K. and Czech Republic. The brands sold include Blue Moon, Carling, Cobra, Coors Light, Miller brands, Molson Canadian and Staropramen. Our Europe license business seeks to build long-term partnerships with leading global brewers to market and grow our international brands, which include licensing arrangements with ABI to brew and distribute Staropramen in Russia and Ukraine. We also have various licensing agreements for the manufacturing and distribution of Carling primarily in Spain and Ukraine. As noted above, effective January 1, 2017, various European markets previously included within MCI, will be presented within our Europe segment.
14

Miller Business
With the recent Acquisition of the Miller global brands, MCI’s global volume footprint has doubled. We have expanded our reach into new and existing markets in Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America. In existing priority markets, such as Panama and Honduras, we intend to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. In new attractive markets, such as Argentina and South Africa, we have begun expanding distribution with local partners, on-boarding our country managers, and activating various transitional service agreements. 
As part of the acquisition of the Miller global brand rights, MCI entered into various Transitional Service Agreements (“TSAs”) with local SABMiller and now ABI owned entities. The intent of these TSAs is to enable the brands to continue to be produced and/or distributed in the local markets while MCI is finalizing its route to market. The services provided through these agreements range from fully brewing, selling, distributing and marketing Miller products on behalf of MCI to solely providing back office services. These TSAs are intended to be temporary in nature and have contractual terms up to a period of three years with the ability to terminate earlier within a specified period of notice. We intend to use the TSAs until MCI has created a presence and route to market in each of these markets.
Corporate
Corporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to any of the operating segments. The majority of these corporate costs relate to worldwide administrative functions, such as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, information technology, finance, internal audit, insurance and risk management, global growth and commercial initiatives, as well as acquisition, integration and financing costs associated with the Acquisition. Additionally, we include in Corporate the results of our water resources and energy operations in Colorado as well as the unrealized changes in fair value on our commodity swaps not designated in hedging relationships, which are later reclassified when realized to the segment in which the underlying exposure resides.
Other Information
Global Intellectual Property
We own trademarks on the majority of the brands we produce and have licenses for the remainder. We also hold several patent and design registrations with expiration dates through 2038 relating to brewing methods, beer dispensing systems, packaging and certain other innovations. We are not reliant on patent royalties for our financial success. Therefore, these expirations are not expected to have a significant impact on our business.
Corporate Responsibility
Corporate responsibility, or Our Beer Print, is integral to our business strategy. We are committed to growing our business the right way while improving the impact we have on our communities, our people and the environment. Since 2012 we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, and were named Beverage Sector Leader in 2012 and 2013. We have retained a position on the World Index since 2012, for five consecutive years.
In 2012, Molson Coors built on long-standing efforts to reduce harmful drinking by becoming a signatory of the Beer, Wine and Spirits Producers’ Commitments to Reduce Harmful Drinking (www.producerscommitments.org). In support of the Commitments we have a robust plan to ensure support across the business, with particular emphasis on our commercial activity through a Commercial Integrity Policy incorporating the recently launched International Alliance for Responsible Drinking Digital Guiding Principles. 
Our approach to improving Our Beer Print within our brewing operations is outlined in our 2020 Sustainability Strategy found on our website at www.molsoncoors.com. Launched in 2013, our 2020 Sustainability Strategy integrates how we manage energy, greenhouse gas emissions, water and solid waste and sets out how we intend to meet our 2020 ambitions. The cornerstone of our 2020 Sustainability Strategy is a commitment to invest in waste water treatment and generate clean energy from this waste stream. These investments will alleviate the impact of our operations on municipal water treatment resources, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and save greenhouse gas emissions. 
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to a variety of extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse effects on human health or the environment. Such laws, regulations or ordinances may impose liability for the cost of remediation, and for certain damages resulting from sites of past releases of hazardous materials. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. While we cannot predict our eventual aggregate cost for the environmental and related matters in which we may be or are currently involved, we believe that any payments, if required, for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any 
15

one year to our operating results, cash flows, or our financial or competitive position. We believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable. However, there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not become more stringent in the future or that we will not incur material costs in the future in order to comply with such laws. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes under the caption "Environmental" for additional information regarding environmental matters.
Employees 
As of the end of 2016, we had approximately 17,400 full-time employees within MCBC globally, including 8,100 within our U.S. segment, 6,100 within our Europe segment, 2,600 within our Canada segment, 400 within our MCI segment, and 200 within our Corporate headquarters in Colorado.
