Overview
We develop and market DNA-based technology solutions utilizing our LinearDNATM large-scale polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) based manufacturing platform. Our proprietary platform produces large quantities of DNA for use in nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostics and preclinical nucleic-acid based drug development and manufacturing markets (“Biotherapeutic Contract Research and Manufacturing”) and for supply chain security, anti-counterfeiting and anti-theft technology purposes (“Non-Biologic Tagging”). In response to the SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”) pandemic, we developed a PCR-based molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19, which was granted Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in May 2020. We currently manufacture and sell our EUA authorized COVID-19 molecular diagnostic test kit under the LineaTM COVID-19 Assay KitTM (“COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Kit”). In addition, and in further response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and are currently offering COVID-19 testing services under our wholly owned subsidiary, Applied DNA Clinical Labs, LLC (“ADCL”). ADCL currently holds a New York clinical laboratory permit and a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §263a (“CLIA”) certification for virology (“Clinical Testing Laboratory”). Using the Company’s COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Kit, ADCL currently offers to clients a high throughput pooled COVID-19 testing program, known as safeCircle(TM), which utilizes high-sensitivity pooled testing to help prevent virus spread by quickly identifying infections within a community, school, or workplace. safeCircle provides to its clients rapid testing results using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) testing (“COVID-19 Testing Services”). The Company is also developing an invasive circulating tumor cell capture and identification technology (“iCTC Technology”) which uses a patented functional assay to capture live invasive circulating tumor cell and associated lymphocytes that can be identified and expanded for further analysis, including genetic sequencing.
The LinearDNA platform was developed to empower the rapid large-scale manufacture of high-fidelity DNA for biotherapeutic applications without the use of bacteria and their extrachromosomal plasmids. Our LinearDNA PCR platform is capable of producing large scale DNA, which we believe offers many benefits over the limitations of other large-scale DNA manufacturing systems, including:

• | Speed – Production of DNA via the LinearDNATM platform can be measured in terms of hours, not days and weeks like other large-scale DNA manufacturing platforms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scale – The LinearDNATM platform is flexible and can be adapted to encompass large quantity production.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Purity – DNA produced via PCR is pure, resulting in only large quantities of the target DNA sequence. Unwanted DNA sequences such as bacterially derived DNA are not present.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customization – DNA produced via PCR can be easily chemically modified to suit specific customer applications.

Industry Background
Biotherapeutic Contract Research and Manufacturing
Our patented continuous flow PCR systems and other proprietary PCR-based production technology and post-processing systems that comprise the LinearDNA platform allow for the large-scale enzymatic production of specific DNA sequences. The LinearDNA platform is currently being used for customers to manufacture DNA as components of in vitro diagnostic tests and for preclinical nucleic acid-based drug development in the fields of adoptive cell therapies (CAR T and TCR therapies), DNA vaccines (anti-viral and cancer), RNA therapies, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) based therapies and gene therapies. We believe our LinearDNATM platform confers a distinct competitive advantage in cost, cleanliness, and time-to-market as compared to other DNA manufacturing systems.
We provide preclinical contract research and manufacturing services for the nucleic acid-based therapeutic markets. We work with biotech and pharmaceutical companies to convert conventional nucleic-acid based preclinical biotherapeutics into PCR-produced LinearDNA-based forms that can be produced on our LinearDNA platform. In addition, we also use our LinearDNA platform to produce very large-scale quantities of DNA for the in vitro diagnostic market where our DNA is used for both commercially available diagnostics and diagnostics under development.
We also seek to develop, acquire, and commercialize, ourselves or with partners, a diverse portfolio of nucleic acid-based therapeutics based on PCR-produced LinearDNA to improve existing nucleic acid-based therapeutics or to create new nucleic acid-based therapeutics that address unmet medical needs.
We are also engaged in preclinical and animal drug candidate development activities focusing on therapeutically relevant DNA constructs manufactured via our LinearDNA production platform. We seek to develop, acquire and commercialize, alone or with partners, a diverse portfolio of nucleic acid-based therapeutics based on PCR-produced linearDNA which we believe will improve existing nucleic acid-based therapeutics or create new nucleic acid-based therapeutics that address unmet medical needs. To this end, we are currently working with our development partners Takis S.R.L. and Evvivax S.R.L. (“Takis/Evvivax”) to develop an amplicon-based linearDNA vaccine for COVID-19 that would be manufactured on our LinearDNA platform. Together with our development partners, our amplicon-based linear COVID-19 vaccine candidate has shown potential therapeutic effect in preclinical cell, mouse and feline animal studies. In September 2020, we entered into an Animal Clinical Trial Agreement with Takis/Evvivax and with Veterinary Oncology Services, PLLC, an affiliate of Guardian Veterinary Specialists (“GVS”), a multi-specialty veterinary hospital. In November 2020, we, together with Takis/Evvivax and GVS, announced receipt of approvals from the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) on an advanced clinical strategy to conduct a veterinary trial of a vaccine candidate. Our jointly developed amplicon-based LinearDNA vaccine for COVID-19 is currently in a veterinary clinical trial in domestic feline. In April 2021, the Company announced preliminary data from its veterinary clinical trial in felines conducted with Takis/Evvivax and GVS. The preliminary data showed that all felines in the trial produced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after a single prime dose of the vaccine candidate. Subsequently in May 2021, we announced additional preliminary data from our feline clinical trial that showed a booster injection of the amplicon-based linear DNA vaccine candidate delivered 30 days after the prime vaccination elected a 5-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titers, with every member of the trial cohort producing neutralizing antibody titers. In June 2021, we further announced preliminary data from an in vitro neutralization study of sera from the feline trial cohort against the B.1.1.7 (U.K.), P1 (Brazil), and B.1.526 (New York) SARS-CoV-2 variants. The preliminary data showed that the amplicon-based linear DNA vaccine candidate induced neutralizing antibodies against the 1.1.7 (U.K.), P1 (Brazil), and B.1.526 (New York) SARS-CoV-2 variants in 100% of the trial cohort. In October 2020, Applied DNA and The Cornell University School of Veterinary Medicine began a SARS-CoV-2 challenge trial in ferrets to assess the protective efficacy of the LinearDNA vaccine against live SARS-CoV-2 virus.

COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Kit
On May 13, 2020 we received an EUA from the FDA for the clinical use of the LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens including anterior nasal swabs, self-collected at a healthcare location or collected by a healthcare worker, and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, mid-turbinate nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal washes/aspirates or nasal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens collected by a healthcare worker from individuals who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Under the EUA, testing is limited to laboratories certified under CLIA, that meet requirements to perform high complexity tests. Subsequently, during July and November 2020, we were granted EUA amendments that expand the installed base of PCR equipment platforms on which our Linea™ COVID-19 Assay Kit can be processed and significantly increased the daily testing capacity of the Linea™ COVID-19 Assay Kit through the use of automation. On May 11, 2021, the EUA was amended to expand the intended use of the LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit to include use with anterior nasal swab specimens that are self-collected in the presence of a healthcare provider from individuals without symptoms or other reasons to suspect COVID-19 when tested at least weekly and with no more than 168 hours between serially collected specimens. The expanded intended use allows ADCL and other certified laboratory users of the LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit, to provide serial screening testing to individuals with the return of individual testing results. The May 11, 2021 amended EUA also updated the LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit’s Instructions for Use to include the KingFisher™ Flex Purification System, a high-throughput robotic nucleic acid extraction system. The scope of the EUA, as amended, is expressly limited to use consistent with the Instructions for Use by authorized laboratories, certified under CLIA to perform high complexity tests. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 is terminated or until the EUA’s prior termination or revocation. Our Linea™ COVID-19 Assay Kit has not been FDA cleared or approved, and the EUA’s limited authorization is only for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens.
In late November 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant of Concern (B.1.1.529) (the “Omicron VOC”) was detected. The Omicron VOC contains over thirty mutations in the Spike region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. On November 29, 2021, the Company announced that initial in silico analysis show that the analytical sensitivity of the Linea COVID-19 Assay Kit may be impacted by the Omicron VOC, resulting in a unique detection pattern that may be specific for the Omicron variant. More specifically, the Linea COVID-19 Assay Kit unique detection pattern may result in false negative results in patients infected with the Omicron variant when tested with the Linea 1.0 Assay as a primary diagnostic. In addition, the Company announced that the Linea COVID-19 Assay Kit may have utility as a reflex test for COVID-19 positive samples from third-party assays to detect whether a sample potentially contains the Omicron VOC. Specifically, the Linea 1.0 Assay may be potentially used as a reflex test to indicate the presence of Omicron in samples that have tested positive for COVID-19 via third-party assays that cannot discriminate for the new variant because these same samples will test negative on the Linea 1.0 Assay due to the kit’s unique detection pattern. The Company also announced a Linea 2.0 Assay, a laboratory developed test (LDT) targeting the N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2, for which validation data has been submitted to New York State Department of Health. In silico analysis has shown that the Linea 2.0 Assay can detect Omicron as well as all other known variants of concern and variants of interest.
We currently manufacture the LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit at our facilities in Stony Brook, New York. The Company’s COVID-19 Assay Test Kit is predominantly utilized by ADCL to provide safeCircle high-throughput pooled COVID-19 testing services.
COVID-19 Testing Services
Under our ADCL subsidiary, on May 10, 2021 we received our New York clinical laboratory permit and our CLIA certification from the New York State Department of Health CLEP, which is currently permitted for virology. As part of our COVID-19 Testing Services our laboratory provides individual COVID-19 testing utilizing our EUA-authorized Linea COVID-19 Assay Kit, pooled screening testing under our July 13, 2021 LDT submission to NYSDOH and pooled surveillance testing that is not regulated by FDA, CDC or CMS.
On November 15, 2021 FDA revised its guidance document titled “Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised)” (FDA COVID-19 Testing Guidance) to require all COVID-19 diagnostic assays conducted as Laboratory-Developed Tests (LDTs) to apply for EUA authorization within a 60-day period from the revised guidance’s issuance date. The FDA Guidance provides an exception for certain notified states, who can authorize in-state laboratories to develop and perform COVID-19 tests under the authority of their own State law in instances where the laboratory did not otherwise submit an EUA request to FDA.

On July 13, 2021, ADCL submitted data supporting the validation of a high-throughput robotic 5-sample pooling workflow utilizing the Linea COVID-19 Assay Kit to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), which is currently pending. New York State falls within the exemption contemplated by FDA’s revised COVID-19 Testing Guidance, meaning ADCL can obtain NYSDOH authorization for conducting the test in lieu of an EUA from FDA. Pursuant to current NYSDOH guidance, ADCL is currently performing the validated workflow in its COVID-19 testing during the pendency of the NYSDOH review.
In the event that NYSDOH declines to authorize ADCL’s performance of the Linea COVID-19 assay on pooled samples, ADCL will be required to submit an EUA to FDA in order to continue performing the validated pooling workflow in its COVID-19 testing. Pursuant to the revised FDA COVID-19 Testing Guidance, laboratories can continue performing validated assays during the pendency of the EUA review by FDA. It is important to note that FDA retains the authority to review, or decline to review, as well as authorize, or decline to authorize, any EUA request for any product. ADCL cannot, therefore, guarantee that it will ultimately obtain authorization to perform its Linea COVID-19 assay on pooled samples if it is required to submit an EUA.
In addition to COVID-19 testing, we intend to work towards expanding our New York clinical laboratory permit and CLIA certifications to include, among other diagnostic tests, our iCTC Technology, which would allow us to further commercialize this technology.
Clinical Testing Laboratory
Under our ADCL subsidiary, on May 10, 2021 we received our New York clinical laboratory permit and our CLIA certification from the New York State Department of Health CLEP for virology. On July 13, 2021, ADCL submitted data supporting the validation of a high-throughput robotic 5-sample pooling workflow utilizing the Linea COVID-19 Assay Kit to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), which is currently pending. Pursuant to current NYSDOH guidance, ADCL is performing the validated workflow in its COVID-19 testing during the pendency of the NYSDOH review.
iCTC Technology
We seek to further develop, manufacture and commercialize our Vita-AssayTM iCTC Technology acquired from Vitatex, Inc. in August 2019. Our iCTC Technology uses a patented functional assay to capture live invasive circulating tumor cell and associated lymphocytes that can be identified and expanded for further analysis, including genetic sequencing. We believe our iCTC Technology can be used as an early cancer diagnostic tool, to facilitate cancer disease progression monitoring, to assess metastatic tumor risk and to discover epitopes to serve as targets for nucleic acid-based immunotherapies. Our iCTC Technology has been used and is currently being used in a human cancer drug candidate clinical trial to monitor cancer disease progression in the trial subjects as a RUO diagnostic assay. We believe our iCTC Technology has several advantages over existing in vitro circulating tumor cell diagnostic technologies that do not capture live iCTC cells. The Company seeks to further develop and commercialize this technology and to potentially integrate aspects of the iCTC Technology with the LinearDNA platform for cancer research and nucleic acid-based drug development.
Non-Biologic Tagging and Security Products and Services
Our supply chain security business allows our customers to use non-biologic DNA (molecular) tags manufactured on our LinearDNA platform to mark objects in a unique manner and then identify these objects by detecting the absence or presence of the molecular tag. We believe our molecular tags are not economically feasible nor practical to replicate, and that our disruptive tracking platform offers broad commercial relevance across many industry verticals.
The underlying strategy in our tagging business is to become an authenticity and traceability platform provider for large complex supply chains, particularly in process industries in which contracts for our products and services are typically larger and recurring over longer duration as compared to our historic norms, where the benefits to customers and consumers are more significant, and where our forensic security and traceability offer a unique and protected value. Using our tagging products and technology, manufacturers, brands, and other stakeholders can ensure authenticity and protect against diversion throughout a product’s journey from manufacturer to use.
SigNature® Molecular Tags, SigNature® T Molecular Tags, fiberTyping®, SigNify® Beacon® and CertainT® comprise our principal Non-Biologic tagging and security technology platform.
