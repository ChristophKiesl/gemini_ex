ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) applications platform developer. Our platform is comprised of a suite of interactive, video-based sales enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis. Our applications, available in both mobile and desktop versions, are offered as a fully integrated suite, as well as on a standalone basis, and include verbCRM, our white-labelled Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) application for large, sales-based enterprises; verbTEAMS, our CRM application for small- and medium-sized businesses and solopreneurs; verbLEARN, our Learning Management System application, and verbLIVE, our Live Stream eCommerce application.
Our Technology
 
Our suite of applications can be distinguished from other sales enablement applications because our applications utilize our proprietary interactive video technology as the primary means of communication between sales and marketing professionals and their customers and prospects. Moreover, the proprietary data collection and analytics capabilities of our applications inform our users on their devices in real time, when and for how long their prospects have watched a video, how many times such prospects watched it, and what they clicked on, which allows our users to focus their time and efforts on ‘hot leads’ or interested prospects rather than on those that have not seen such video or otherwise expressed interest in such content. Users can create their hot lead lists by using familiar, intuitive ‘swipe left/swipe right’ on-screen navigation. Our clients report that these capabilities provide for a much more efficient and effective sales process, resulting in increased sales conversion rates. We developed the proprietary patent-pending interactive video technology, as well as several other patent-issued and patent-pending technologies that serve as the unique foundation for all our platform applications.
Our Products
 
verbCRM combines the capabilities of CRM lead-generation, content management, and in-video ecommerce capabilities in an intuitive, yet powerful tool for both inexperienced as well as highly skilled sales professionals. verbCRM allows users to quickly and easily create, distribute, and post videos to which they can add a choice of on-screen clickable icons which, when clicked, allow viewers to respond to the user’s call-to-action in real-time, in the video, while the video is playing, without leaving or stopping the video. For example, our technology allows a prospect or customer to click on a product they see featured in a video and impulse buy it, or to click on a calendar icon in the video to make an appointment with a salesperson, among many other novel features and functionalities designed to eliminate or reduce friction from the sales process for our users. The verbCRM app is designed to be easy to use and navigate, and takes little time and training for a user to begin using the app effectively. It usually takes less than four minutes for a novice user to create an interactive video from our app. Users can add interactive icons to pre-existing videos, as well as to newly created videos shot with practically any mobile device. verbCRM interactive videos can be distributed via email, text messaging, chat app, or posted to popular social media directly and easily from our app. No software download is required to view Verb interactive videos on virtually any mobile or desktop device, including smart TVs.
 
verbLEARN is an interactive, video-based learning management system that incorporates all of the clickable in-video technology featured in our verbCRM application and adapts them for use by educators for video-based education. verbLEARN is used by enterprises seeking to educate a large sales team or a customer base about new products, or elicit feedback about existing products. It also incorporates Verb’s proprietary data collection and analytics capabilities that inform users in real time when and for how long the viewers watched the video, how many times they watched it, and what they clicked on, in addition to adding gamification features that enhance the learning aspects of the application.
 
verbLIVE builds on popular video-based platforms such as Facebook Live, Zoom, WebEx, and Go2Meeting, among others, by adding Verb’s proprietary interactive in-video ecommerce capabilities – including an in-video Shopify shopping cart integrated for Shopify account holders – to our own live stream video broadcasting application. verbLIVE is a next-generation live stream platform that allows hosts to utilize a variety of novel sales-driving features, including placing interactive icons on-screen that appear on the screens of all viewers, providing in-video click-to-purchase capabilities for products or services featured in the live video broadcast, in real-time, driving friction-free selling. verbLIVE also provides the host with real-time viewer engagement data and interaction analytics. verbLIVE is entirely browser-based, allowing it to function easily and effectively on all devices without requiring the host or the viewers to download software, and is secured through end-to-end encryption. A mobile app-based version of verbLIVE, with enhanced features, is currently in development and is expected to be released in early second quarter of 2021.
 
verbTEAMS is our interactive, video-based CRM for small-and medium-sized businesses and solopreneurs. verbTEAMS also incorporates verbLIVE as a bundled application. verbTEAMS incorporates self-sign-up, self-onboarding, self-configuring, content management system capabilities, user level administrative capabilities, and high-quality analytics capabilities in both mobile and desktop platforms that sync with one another. It also has a built-in one-click sync capability with Salesforce.

Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business and Industry
 
In the three months ended June 30, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant uncertainty and volatility in a wide variety of industries and markets, including in our industry, and prompted many federal, state, local, and foreign governments to implement various lock-down measures in an attempt to contain the spread and mitigate the impact of the disease. The initial implementation of such lock-down measures, and their re-introduction in response to a nation-wide resurgence of COVID-19 cases in late-2020, resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and the cancellation or postponement of events.
 
Despite recent approval and initial distribution of vaccines, both the pandemic and the containment and mitigation measures have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse impact on the global and U.S. economies, the severity and duration of which are uncertain. It is likely that government stabilization efforts will only partially mitigate the consequences to the economy. As such, both the pandemic and containment and mitigation measures may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition by, among other things, reducing demand for our applications, impairing the productivity of our workforce, and reducing our access to capital. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, financial conditions, and results of operations in the future remains uncertain and will be affected by a number of factors. These include the duration and extent of the pandemic, the duration and extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures, the extent, duration, and effective execution of government stabilization and recovery efforts, including those from the successful distribution of effective vaccines.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic may have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working. This may present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business. However, we are committed to our employees returning to the workplace in the long-term. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2020 and through the filing of this Annual Report, we have encouraged safe practices designed to stem the infection and spread of COVID-19 within our workforce and beyond and to maintain the mental health and well-being of our employees. Beginning in March 2020, in an effort to protect our employees and comply with applicable government orders, we restricted non-essential employee travel and transitioned our employees to a remote work environment. We currently expect the majority of our employees will continue working remotely at least through the second quarter of 2021. Our workforce has continued to effectively develop and support our product and service offerings notwithstanding the current environment.
 
We began the year ended December 31, 2020 with healthy demand for our products and services, many of which are designed to enable our customers to manage their businesses virtually. In the three months ended June 30, 2020, we experienced some uncertainty regarding whether there would be variability in demand for the services we provide on our platform after lock-down measures were implemented. We expect demand variability for our products and services may continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, our sales team reported a higher level of interest in our products and services during the year ended December 31, 2020. Although the impact has not been material to date, a prolonged downturn in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our customers and demand for our services.
 
We continue to actively communicate with and listen to our customers to ensure we are responding to their needs in the current environment with innovative solutions that will not only be beneficial now but also over the long-term. We monitor developments related to COVID-19 and remain flexible in our response to the challenges presented by the pandemic. To mitigate the adverse impact COVID-19 may have on our business and operations, we implemented a number of measures in the year ended December 31, 2020 to protect the health and safety of our employees, as well as to strengthen our financial position. These efforts include eliminating, reducing, or deferring non-essential expenditures, as well as complying with local and state government recommendations to protect our workforce.
 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Annual Report. For a complete description of the material risks we currently face, refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
 
Verb Partnerships and Integrations
 
We have completed and deployed the integration of verbLIVE into Salesforce and passed their security review process. In recent weeks we launched a joint marketing campaign with Salesforce to introduce the verbLIVE plug-in functionality to current Salesforce users. A verbCRM sync application for Salesforce users is currently being utilized by at least one of our large enterprise clients and the verbLIVE plug-in is now being offered to all Salesforce users on a monthly subscription fee basis.
 
We have completed the integration of verbCRM into systems offered by 17 of the most popular direct sales back-office system providers, such as Direct Scale, Exigo, By Design, Thatcher, Multisoft, Xennsoft, and Party Plan. Direct sales back-office systems provide many of the support functions required for direct sales operations, including payroll, customer genealogy management, statistics, rankings, and earnings, among other direct sales financial tracking capabilities. The integration into these back-office providers, facilitated through our own API development, allows single sign-on convenience for users, as well as enhanced data analytics and reporting capabilities for all users. We believe that our integration into these back-end platforms accelerates the adoption of verbCRM by large direct sales enterprises that rely on these systems and as such, we believe this represents a competitive advantage.
 
We are currently working to introduce an integration of our interactive video technology into Microsoft Outlook followed by a broad-scale launch in early 2021, pursuant to and in accordance with our existing Microsoft partnership agreement. We expect to follow the Microsoft Outlook integration with the integration into other Microsoft Office 365 products.
 
Non-Digital Products and Services
 
Historically, we have also provided certain non-digital services to some of our enterprise clients such as printing and fulfillment services. We designed and printed welcome kits and starter kits for their marketing needs and provided fulfillment services, which consisted of managing the preparation, handling and shipping of our client’s custom-branded merchandise they use for marketing purposes at conferences and other events. We also managed the fulfillment of our clients’ product sample packs that verbCRM users order through the app for automated delivery and tracking to their customers and prospects.
 
However, on May 20, 2020, we executed a contract with Range Printing (“Range”), a company in the business of providing enterprise class printing, sample assembly, warehousing, packaging, shipping, and fulfillment services. Pursuant to the contract, through an automated process we have established for this purpose, Range will receive orders for samples and merchandise from us as and when we receive them from our clients and users, and print, assemble, store, package and ship such samples and merchandise on our behalf. The Range contract provides for a revenue share arrangement based upon the specific services to be provided by Range that is designed to maintain our relationship with our clients by continuing to service their non-digital needs, while eliminating the labor and overhead costs associated with the provision of such services by us. The transition to Range Printing is now complete.

Our Market
 
Our client base consists primarily of multi-national direct sales enterprises to whom we provide white-labeled, client-branded versions of our products. Our clients also include large professional associations and educational institutions, including school districts, auto sales, auto leasing, insurance, real estate, home security, not-for-profits, as well as clients in the health care industry, and the burgeoning CBD industry, among other business sectors. As of March 26, 2021, we provide subscription-based application services to approximately 140 enterprise clients for use in over 60 countries, in over 48 languages, which collectively account for a user base generated through more than 1.9 million downloads of our verbCRM application. Among the new business sectors targeted for this year are pharmaceutical sales, government institutions, small businesses and individual entrepreneurs.

We generate revenue from the following sources:
 

● | recurring subscription fees paid by enterprise users and affiliates; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | recurring subscription fees paid by non-enterprise, small business, and individual users; 
● | recurring subscription fees paid by users who access in-app purchases of various premium services, features, functionality, and upgrades; 
● | recurring subscription fees paid by users who access in-app purchases of third-party software provider apps in our forthcoming app store; 
● | recurring subscription fees paid by users of Salesforce and Microsoft among others with whom we have executed partnership agreements, for access to our applications that we either have integrated or intend to integrate into these platforms, including recurring subscription fees paid by users who subscribe to bundled service offerings from these partners and/or their respective value-added resellers; 
● | recurring subscription fees paid by users for all of the foregoing products and services generated through our recently launched Japan operations; 
● | recurring subscription fees paid by users generated through our forthcoming reseller and affiliate distribution programs; and

Distribution Methods
 
We distribute our services through the following methods:
 

● | Prospective customers and clients can subscribe to our applications on a monthly or annual contract through a simple, web-based sign-up form accessible on our website (https://www.verb.tech), as well as through interactive sign-up links that we distribute via email, text messaging and through social media; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enterprise users that subscribe to our verbCRM software service can distribute custom-branded sign-up links to their internal and external staff via email or other electronic means; 
● | We have entered into partnership agreements with other CRM providers to incorporate our interactive video technology into such other CRM providers’ software platforms to be offered to their existing and prospective client base for an additional monthly recurring fee, which fee is shared with us. In January 2018, we entered into such an agreement with Oracle America, Inc. to integrate our interactive video technology into their NetSuite platform on a revenue-share basis. In February 2018, we entered into a similar agreement with Adobe Marketo to integrate our interactive video technology into their platform on a revenue-share basis. On January 23, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to integrate our interactive video technology into Microsoft’s Office 365 services product line, beginning with its email platform Outlook and their internal communications platform TEAMS. On February 4, 2019, we entered into a revenue share partnership agreement with Salesforce.com to integrate our interactive video technology into the Salesforce.com CRM platform.

● | We have entered into license and partnership agreements with digital marketing companies and advertising agencies to resell our Verb interactive video technology to their existing and prospective client bases for monthly fees which fees are shared with us. In March 2018, we entered into such an agreement with DR2Marketing, LLC to use and resell our applications to their clients on a revenue-share basis; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We expect to enter into partnership agreements with large cloud services providers, to bundle our application with such providers’ other applications offered to their existing and prospective global customer base in order to generate greater utilization fees from such customers’ need for more data storage and bandwidth required by video-based applications. For example, under our agreement with Microsoft, their value-added cloud services resellers may choose to bundle our application for resale to their respective customer bases; and 
● | We employ a direct sales team, as well as outside sales consultants. 

Our Japan Operations
 
In April 2020, we commenced local language sales, sales support, customer support, and marketing operations in Japan. In order to ensure compliance with Japan’s laws, rules and regulations, our operations were established pursuant to, and in accordance with, an exclusive reseller agreement with an existing Tokyo-based Japanese corporation operated by a team with over 30-years’ experience in the Japan direct sales industry. They operate and market our applications in Japan under the Verb brand.
 
Japan represents the 3rd largest global economy and the 5th largest direct sales market. There are approximately four million direct sales representatives in Japan which accounted for approximately $16B in 2018 direct sales revenue. More than 50% of our current U.S.-based enterprise clients have a substantial number of sales representatives in Japan that currently do not subscribe to our application, with five of those clients generating the majority of their revenue from their Japan-based sales. We believe the in-country sales, sales support, and customer service we can provide through native language speaking staff in Japan represents a significant opportunity for us to grow our applications subscription business and enhance our clients’ Japan initiatives. Since we began operations, we have executed verbCRM subscription agreements with 6 Japanese enterprise clients. As of December 31, 2020, Japan isn’t a significant source of revenue.
 
We are exploring a similar expansion opportunity in Korea, which has the 3rd largest direct sales market in the world.
 
Our Historical Background
 
We are a Nevada corporation originally formed as a limited liability company in 2012 as Cutaia Media Group, LLC, or CMG. In May 2014, CMG merged into bBooth, Inc., and in October 2014, bBooth, Inc. changed its name to bBooth (USA), Inc.
 
In October 2014, bBooth (USA), Inc. was acquired by Global System Designs, Inc. In connection with the acquisition, Global Systems Design, Inc. changed its name to bBooth, Inc.
 
In April 2017, we changed our name from bBooth, Inc. to nFüsz, Inc, and in February 2019 we changed our name from nFüsz, Inc. to Verb Technology Company, Inc.
 
On February 1, 2019, we implemented a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, or common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every fifteen shares of our pre-split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. Our consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock.

In April 2019, we acquired Sound Concepts Inc. (“Sound Concepts”) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger. As a result of the merger, Sound Concepts merged with and into our wholly owned subsidiary, NF Acquisition Company, LLC. Upon completion of the merger, NF Acquisition Company, LLC changed its name to Verb Direct, LLC (“Verb Direct”).
 
On September 4, 2020, Verb Acquisition Co., LLC (“Verb Acquisition”), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Ascend Certification, LLC, dba SoloFire (“SoloFire”).
 
Our common stock and common stock purchase warrants trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “VERB” and “VERBW,” respectively. Our Internet website address is https://www.verb.tech.
 
Marketing
 
We utilize our own proprietary interactive video platform as the foundation of our ongoing marketing initiatives. Our initiatives include, among other things, daily, broad-based social media engagement by a dedicated team of full-time employees and outside consultants; management of our interactive video-based website; and interactive video-based email campaigns and television commercials. In addition, the 17 direct sales back office systems providers with whom we have integrated verbCRM, market our applications to their customers and prospects in exchange for finders’ fees.
Competition
 
CRM software generated more than $48.2 billion in sales revenue throughout the world in 2018, has grown to become the largest software segment, overtaking data management software, and is expected to reach more than $80 billion in sales revenue by 2025. We compete in the CRM applications industry, as well as in the video conferencing/webinar industry. We believe that CRM applications that incorporate our proprietary Verb interactive video technology provide significant competitive advantages over the CRM applications that do not. Salesforce, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and Adobe, the long-term leaders in the CRM sector, collectively account for approximately 41% of industry sales. These companies, as well as many others, have numerous differences in feature sets and functionality, but all share certain basic attributes. Most of them were designed before the advent and proliferation of mobile phones, social media, and the technology behind the current ubiquity of video over the internet and more recently on mobile devices. While many of them have attempted to incorporate video capabilities into their respective CRM platforms, sometimes in ‘‘bolt-on’’ fashion, we do not believe any of them has done so in a manner that is as effective as our interactive in-video ecommerce platform that allows users to place clickable calls-to-action right in the video, including into users’ pre-existing sales and product videos. In addition, Verb’s interactive videos are viewable on both mobile and desktop devices regardless of operating system and without the need to download a proprietary player or program.
 
We also compete in the video webinar and ecommerce solution provider sectors. The webinar sector is dominated by Zoom, WebEx, and Go2Meeting, among others. The ecommerce solution provider sector is dominated by Shopify, among others. However, we believe our verbLIVE application provides a superior solution for users seeking to use video webinars as a sales tool because our in-video clickable icons provide seamless in-video ecommerce capabilities that are not offered by either Zoom (or other large webinar providers) or Shopify. We believe verbLIVE represents a unique solution that combines the best features of Zoom and Shopify in a single application, offering users a more friction-free and effective selling experience. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the market share, marketing strength, and established positions in the marketplace of our competitors may prevent us from obtaining a large share of these markets.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our policy is to protect our technology through, among other things, a combination of patents, trade secrets and copyrights. We primarily rely upon trade secrets and copyrighted proprietary software, code, and know-how to protect our interactive video technology platform and associated applications. We have taken security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to the extent possible. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not prove to be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Trade secret and copyright laws afford only limited protection for our technology and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace.

We recently filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) with respect to providing interactive video streams involving interactive buttons which we utilize in our video products. However, our provisional patent application may not result in the issuance of a patent, or may result in narrow claims, which may limit the protection we are attempting to obtain. We also hold a number of granted patents in two families with pending continuations. A first family relates to systems and methods for enhanced networking, conversion tracking, and conversion attribution. This family contains two issued patents (U.S. Pat. No. 9,792,380, issued October 17, 2017; and U.S. Pat. No. 10,467,317, issued Nov. 5, 2019) and a pending continuation. A second family relates to systems and methods for generating a custom campaign. This family contains one issued patent (U.S. Pat. No. 10,643,247, issued May 5, 2020) and a pending continuation. These existing patents and any future patents that may be issued to us, may not protect commercially important aspects of our technology. Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of such patents may be challenged by third parties, which may result in our patents being invalidated or modified by the PTO, various legal actions against us, the need to develop or obtain alternative technology and/or obtain appropriate licenses under third party patents, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
 
Third parties may independently develop technology that is not covered by our patents, that is similar to, or competes with, our technology. In addition, our intellectual property may be infringed or misappropriated by third parties, particularly in foreign countries where the laws and governmental authorities may not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as those in the United States.
 
There is a risk that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights may not be adequate, and weaknesses or failures in this area could adversely affect our business or reputation, financial condition, and/or operating results.
 
We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. Despite our precautions, we cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims.
 
Research and Development
 
We incurred $7,933,000 and $4,312,000 of research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These expenses were incurred for the development of our interactive video-based sales enablement platform and associated applications.
Suppliers
 
While most of our design, development, and engineering team is U.S.-based, we currently utilize a small group of dedicated full-time and part-time off-shore experienced professionals for some of the coding and maintenance of our software. We believe we have mitigated the risks associated with managing an external team of software development professionals by incorporating experienced internal management and oversight, as well as appropriate systems, protocols, controls, and procedures to ensure the protection and integrity of all our applications. We have also ensured access to additional qualified professionals to provide like or complementary services on an as-needed basis.
Dependence on Key Customers
 
Based on our current business and anticipated future activities as described in this Annual Report, we do not have any customers that represent more than 10% of our 2020 revenue.
Government Regulation
 
Our software and services are subject to certain legal, regulatory and other requirements. These laws are complex and evolving. Various U.S. federal and state laws govern many of our business activities, including, without limitation, the processing of payments and handling of consumer information. Despite our significant efforts to comply with all applicable requirements, there can be no guarantee that our efforts will be sufficient or that existing laws, rules or other requirements will not be interpreted, revised, augmented or rewritten in a way that adversely affects our regulated business activities, which comprise a significant majority of our overall business. For additional information related to these risk-related issues, refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” within this Annual Report.

Employees
 
As of March 26, 2020, we had 104 full-time statutory employees, four part-time employees, and 59 independent contractors. We engage independent contractors on an as-needed-basis to provide specific expertise in areas of software design, development and coding, content creation, audio and video editing, video production services, and other business functions, including marketing and accounting. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and believe our relationship with our employees, consultants, and consultants, both full-time and part-time, is satisfactory.
 
We believe our people are at the heart of our success and our customers’ success. We endeavor to not only attract and retain talented employees, but also to provide a challenging and rewarding environment to motivate and develop our valuable human capital. We look to our talented employees to lead and foster various initiatives that support our company culture including those related to diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we rely heavily on our talented team to execute our growth plans and achieve our long-term strategic objectives.
 
We provide competitive compensation and benefits for our employees. Our compensation packages may include base salary, commission or annual performance-based bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We also offer general employee medical, dental, and vision insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, mental health resources, paid time off, paid family leave, life and disability insurance, and 401(k) plan matching contributions. These programs and our overall compensation packages seek to attract and retain talented employees.
 
We take the health and welfare of our employees very seriously, and have encouraged safe practices designed to stem the infection and spread of COVID-19 within our workforce and beyond and to maintain the mental health and well-being of our employees. Beginning in March 2020, in an effort to protect our employees and comply with applicable government orders, we restricted non-essential employee travel and transitioned our employees to a remote work environment. We currently expect the majority of our employees will continue working remotely at least through the second quarter of 2021. We are committed to our employees returning to the workplace in the long-term.
