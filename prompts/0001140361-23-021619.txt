Partners
 Kaspien views our retail customers as our partners. Our partners include brands, suppliers, and distributors. Our categories of focus include but are not limited to: Baby, Pets & Sporting Goods, Tools/Office/Outdoors, and Health & Personal Care.  In fiscal 2022, these top categories accounted for approximately 83% of our total revenue.  To accelerate the growth of our businesses, we have defined an operating model by segmenting our businesses into teams, with a single-threaded leader or “Partner Success Manager” runs. A cross-functional team, including a marketing specialist and a buyer, supports each Partner Success Manager, collectively called a “business POD.”
 
Kaspien uses leading online tools to identify brands that would be good strategic fits for its services. We utilize content marketing to strengthen visibility within the e-commerce industry. The Company’s public relations efforts consist of press releases, articles in industry publications, and articles on its website to build its brand. Kaspien also has an aggressive business development outreach program and attends several industry tradeshows annually.
 
Partnership Models
 Kaspien can be leveraged and engaged via two primary and distinct business models.
 
Retail Partnership: We own the inventory. We sell it.
 In this model, Kaspien buys and sells inventory on marketplaces such as Amazon.com, Walmart.com and Target.com as a third-party seller. Kaspien supports private label and dropship integrations with various suppliers and distributors.  Kaspien has also developed four incubated brands – Jumpoff Jo, Brilliant Bee, Big Betty, and Domestic Corner.
Agency Partnership: Partner owns the inventory. We sell it.
 In this model, Kaspien serves as an extension of our partner’s e-commerce team, providing full service inventory management, marketing management, creative services, content optimization, brand protection, compliance protection, fee recovery, and other marketplace growth services. Kaspien charges a retainer and receives a percentage of the revenue generated.

Technology and Integrations
 
The Company’s marketplace knowledge and expertise is built on fifteen years of selling data and constantly evolving marketplace experience. The company utilizes a variety of automated and artificial intelligence powered solutions supporting brand protection services, logistics optimization, automated pricing, budget forecasting, campaign bid automation, dayparting, and much more.
 
The Company uses an insight-driven approach to digital marketplace retailing using both proprietary and licensed software. Using data collected from marketplaces, optimal inventory thresholds and purchasing trends are calculated within its advanced inventory management software developed in-house. Kaspien also leverages best in class software to automate pricing, advertisement management, marketplace seller tracking, and channel auditing.

Kaspien has formed strategic partnerships with NetSuite to power our ERP, MyFBAPrep for their logistics and fulfillment network, IPSecure for brand protection, Seller Investigators and Charge Guard for fee recovery services, Helium10 for keyword research, Vantage for content optimization, and many others.
 
Business Environment
 Digital marketplaces allow consumers to shop from various merchants in one place and have become an integral part of many brand manufacturers’ businesses.
 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. e-commerce sales in 2022 were $1.0 billion, up 7.7% from 2021.  e-commerce sales ended the year accounting for 14.6% of total sales, the same level as 2021.
 
In the United States, we sell on marketplaces that represent greater than 50% of national e-commerce visits and sales including Amazon.com US, Amazon.com CA, Walmart.com, and Target.com.
 
Competition and Strategic Positioning
 Kaspien operates in a category within e-commerce called “Marketplace Growth Services”. Businesses in this category provide services to brands and other sellers to facilitate growth on marketplaces. The market is fragmented, and most providers focus on only a few areas where sellers need support. Subcategories in this market include Account and Marketing Services, Supply Chain and Logistics Providers, Manufacturers and Product Suppliers, Legal Services and Accounting, Tax and Financial Services. The Account and Marketing Services subcategory divides services into retail and agency services. This is analogous to our business models – Retail and Agency.
 
Kaspien is a comprehensive and fully customizable offering of services tailored toward online marketplace growth. Kaspien’s core focus is on the Account and Marketing Services subcategory, which competes with Software Providers, Agencies, and Retailers.
 
Revenue Distribution
 Kaspien’s primary source of revenue is through its Retail business, specifically as a third-party seller on the Amazon US marketplace. Retail revenues represented 98.6% of total revenue in fiscal 2022, the same level as fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, the share of our retail revenues generated from our Amazon US business was 94.8%, as compared to 93.3% in fiscal 2021. Our international retail business represented 2.5% of retail sales in fiscal 2022 compared to 3.9% in fiscal year 2021. The remaining retail revenue is generated from other marketplaces, including Amazon.com CA, Walmart.com, eBay.com, and Target.com.
 
Kaspien focuses on various categories, including pets and sporting goods, baby, tools / office / outdoor, health & personal care, and home / kitchen.  In fiscal year 2022, these categories represented approximately 83% of our total revenue. Kaspien analyzes our operations by category, developing a deep understanding and subject matter expertise in these areas, enabling us to drive better results across these categories.
 


Human Capital
  As of January 28, 2023, the Company employed approximately 80 full-time people. At the end of fiscal 2022, the Company had department heads in marketing, supply chain, private label, business development, account management, human resources, accounting, FP&A, warehouse operations, compliance, and technology. Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business, and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
 
 The Company believes its success depends on attracting, developing, retaining, and incentivizing new and existing employees. It also believes that its employees' skills, experience, and industry knowledge significantly benefit the operation, performance, and competitiveness within the industry. The principal purposes of equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain, and reward personnel by granting stock-based and cash-based compensation awards.  This results in a best-in-class employee experience, which ultimately increases shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 
Customer Acquisition
 Kaspien engages its partners through brand building, inbound digital marketing, outbound sales techniques, and its proprietary data platform to identify brands that would be a strategic fit for its services. Kaspien utilizes tradeshows and content marketing to strengthen its visibility within the industry. Kaspien’s public relations efforts consist of press releases, articles in industry publications, and articles on its website to build its brand.
