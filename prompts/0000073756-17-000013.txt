GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
Oceaneering International, Inc. is a global oilfield provider of engineered services and products, primarily to the offshore oil and gas industry, with a focus on deepwater applications. Oceaneering also serves the defense, aerospace and commercial theme park industries. Oceaneering was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1969 out of the combination of three diving service companies founded in the early 1960s. Since our establishment, we have concentrated on the development and marketing of underwater services and products to meet customer needs requiring the use of advanced deepwater technology. We believe we are one of the world's largest underwater services contractors. The services and products we provide to the oil and gas industry include remotely operated vehicles, specialty subsea hardware, engineering and project management, subsea intervention services, including manned diving, survey and positioning services and asset integrity and nondestructive testing services. Our foreign operations, principally in the North Sea, Africa, Brazil, Australia and Asia, accounted for approximately 57% of our revenue, or $1.3 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Our business segments are contained within two businesses – services and products provided to the oil and gas industry ("Oilfield") and all other services and products ("Advanced Technologies"). Our four business segments within the Oilfield business are Remotely Operated Vehicles ("ROVs"), Subsea Products, Subsea Projects and Asset Integrity. We report our Advanced Technologies business as one segment. Unallocated Expenses are expenses not associated with a specific business segment. These consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans, including restricted stock and bonuses, as well as other general expenses.
Oilfield. The primary focus of our Oilfield business over the last several years has been toward increasing our asset base and capabilities for providing services and products for deepwater offshore operations and subsea completions. In more recent years we have focused on increasing our service and product offerings toward our customers' operating expenses.
During the past ten years, we have acquired businesses to expand and complement our service and product offerings. These include:

• | a Canadian manufacturer of clamp connectors, check valves and universal ball joints;


• | a Norwegian-based provider of inspection, maintenance, subsea engineering and field operations services, principally to the oil and gas industry


• | a Norwegian rental provider of specialized subsea dredging equipment, including ROV-deployed units, to the offshore oil and gas industry;


• | a Norwegian oilfield technology company specializing in providing subsea tooling services and plugging, abandonment and decommissioning of offshore oil and gas production platforms and subsea wellheads;


• | a Norwegian design and fabrication company specializing in subsea tools for the offshore oil and gas industry;


• | a U.S.-based international provider of survey and positioning services;


• | a business that uses ROVs to perform surveys on mobile offshore drilling units and floating production systems that satisfy the underwater inspection in lieu of drydocking (UWILD) requirements of all major classification societies; and 


• | the assets of a provider of riserless light well intervention services.

ROVs. We provide ROVs, which are tethered submersible vehicles remotely operated from the surface, to customers in the oil and gas industry for drilling support and vessel-based services, including subsea hardware installation, construction, pipeline inspection, survey and facilities inspection, maintenance and repair. We design and build our new ROVs at in-house facilities, the largest of which is in Morgan City, LA. In 2016, we manufactured and added 6 ROVs to our fleet and retired 41. Our work-class ROV fleet size was 280 at December 31, 2016, 315 at December 31, 2015 and 336 at December 31, 2014. We have decreased our ROV fleet size over the last two years as a result of lower market demand.

Subsea Products. We manufacture or assemble a variety of specialty subsea oilfield products. These encompass production control umbilicals, tooling and subsea work systems, installation and workover control systems ("IWOCS"), and subsea hardware.
While most of our products are sold, we also rent tooling and provide IWOCS and subsea work systems as a service, including hydrate remediation, well stimulation, dredging and decommissioning.
To improve operational efficiency, in 2016 we reorganized our Subsea Products segment into two business units – (1) manufactured products and (2) service and rental. Manufactured products include production control umbilicals and specialty subsea hardware, while service and rental includes tooling, subsea work systems and installation and workover control systems, which we design and build but operate as a service. This internal reorganization does not affect our segment reporting structure or the historical comparability of our segment results.
We provide various types of subsea umbilicals through our Umbilical Solutions division from plants in the United States, Scotland and Brazil. Offshore operators use umbilicals to control subsea wellhead hydrocarbon flow rates, monitor downhole and wellhead conditions and perform chemical injection. Subsea umbilicals are also used to provide power and fluids to other subsea processing hardware, including pumps and gas separation equipment. We continue to invest in our plants to meet the requirements of the deepwater operations of our customers.
Subsea Projects. Our Subsea Projects segment consists of our subsea installation, inspection, maintenance and repair services, principally in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola and India, utilizing a fleet of two owned and three long-term chartered dynamically positioned deepwater vessels with integrated high-specification work-class ROVs onboard, and four owned shallow water diving vessels, spot-chartered vessels and other assets. All of our owned vessels are Jones Act-compliant. The dynamically positioned vessels are equipped with thrusters that allow them to maintain a constant position at a location without the use of anchors. They are used in the inspection, maintenance and repair of subsea facilities, pipeline or flowline tie-ins, pipeline crossings and installations. These vessels can carry and install equipment or umbilicals required to bring subsea well completions into production (tie-back to production facilities). 
Unless indicated otherwise, each of the chartered vessels discussed below is a deepwater multiservice subsea support vessel outfitted with two of our high-specification work-class ROVs. 
Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, we chartered a vessel, the Olympic Intervention IV, for an initial term of five years. Following extension periods, the charter expired in July 2016, and we released the vessel to its owner. We had been using the Olympic Intervention IV in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
In 2012, we moved the chartered vessel Ocean Intervention III to Angola and also chartered the Bourbon Oceanteam 101 to work on a three-year field support vessel services contract for a unit of BP plc. We had extended the charter of the Bourbon Oceanteam 101 to January 2017. However, in early 2016, the customer exercised its right, under the field support vessel services contract, to terminate its use of the Bourbon Oceanteam 101 at the end of May 2016. Under the terms of the contract, the costs incurred by us associated with the early release and demobilization of the vessel were reimbursed by the customer. Following the release of the vessel, we redelivered it to the vessel supplier. Under the field support vessel services contract, which has been extended through January 2019, we are continuing to supply project management, engineering and the Ocean Intervention III, which we have under charter on a month-to-month basis through July 2017. We also provide ROV tooling, asset integrity services and installation and workover control system services. We also have provided other chartered vessels and barges as requested by the customer.
In March 2013, we commenced a five-year charter for a Jones Act-compliant multi-service support vessel, the Ocean Alliance, we have been using in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In January 2015, we commenced a two-year contract with a customer for the use of the Ocean Alliance. The contract expired in January 2017, and we are marketing the vessel for spot market work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

In December 2013, we commenced a three-year charter for the Normand Flower, a multi-service subsea marine support vessel. We made modifications to the vessel and used the vessel in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to perform inspection, maintenance and repair projects and hardware installations. In December 2016, we declined our option to extend the charter and the vessel was released.
In November 2015, we commenced a two-year charter for the use of the Island Pride, a multi-service subsea marine support vessel. We are using the vessel under a two-year contract to provide field support services off the coast of India for an oil and gas customer based in India. We have options to extend the charter for up to two additional years.
We also charter or lease vessels on a short-term basis as necessary to augment our fleet.
In 2010, we acquired a vessel, which we renamed the Ocean Patriot, and we have converted it to a dynamically positioned saturation diving and ROV service vessel. We installed a 12-man saturation ("SAT") diving system and one work-class ROV on the vessel, and we placed the vessel into service in December 2011. 
During the third quarter of 2013, we signed an agreement with a shipyard for the construction of a subsea support vessel, to be named the Ocean Evolution. We expect delivery of that vessel in the middle of 2017. We intend for the vessel to be U.S.-flagged and documented with a coastwise endorsement by the U.S. Coast Guard. It is expected to have an overall length of 353 feet, a Class 2 dynamic positioning system, accommodations for 110 personnel, a helideck, a 250-ton active heave-compensated crane, and a working moonpool. We expect to outfit the vessel with two of our high specification work-class ROVs. The vessel will also be equipped with a satellite communications system capable of transmitting streaming video for real-time work observation by shore personnel. We anticipate the vessel will be used to augment our ability to provide subsea intervention services in the ultra-deep waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. These services are required to perform inspection, maintenance and repair projects and hardware installations.
In 2015, we acquired C & C Technologies, Inc. ("C&C") for approximately $224 million. C&C is a global provider of ocean-bottom mapping services in deepwater utilizing customized autonomous underwater vehicles and provides marine construction surveys for both surface and subsea assets, as well as satellite-based positioning services for drilling rigs and seismic and construction vessels. C&C also provides land and near-shore survey services along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Mexico, and performs shallow water conventional geophysical surveys in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
In 2016, we acquired the assets of Blue Ocean Technologies, LLC, a privately held provider of riserless light well intervention ("RLWI") services. Subsea well intervention services are intended to maximize production and increase the recovery rate from offshore oil and gas reservoirs or, alternatively, prepare wells to be plugged and abandoned. These RLWI systems have the capability to perform a wide variety of cost-effective services for well interventions, including well diagnostics, damaged well remediation and workovers, and well plugging and abandonment. 
Asset Integrity. Through our Asset Integrity division, we provide asset integrity management, corrosion management, inspection, and non-destructive testing services, principally to customers in the oil and gas, power generation, and petrochemical industries. We perform these services on both onshore and offshore facilities, both topside and subsea.
In December 2011, we purchased a Norwegian-based provider of inspection, maintenance, subsea engineering and field operations services, principally to the oil and gas industry. 
General. During the last five years, we have also made several small acquisitions to add complementary technology or niche markets. We intend to continue our strategy of acquiring, as opportunities arise, additional assets or businesses, to improve our market position or expand into related service and product lines.
Advanced Technologies. Our Advanced Technologies provides engineering services and related manufacturing, principally to the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA and its prime contractors, and the commercial theme park industry.

MARKETING
Oilfield. Oil and gas exploration and development expenditures fluctuate from year to year. In particular, budgetary approval for more expensive drilling and production in deepwater, an area in which we have a high degree of focus, may be postponed or suspended during periods when exploration and production companies reduce their offshore capital spending. In more recent years, we have focused on increasing our service and product offerings toward our customers' operating expenses.
We market our ROVs, Subsea Products, Subsea Projects and Asset Integrity services and products to domestic, international and foreign national oil and gas companies engaged in offshore exploration, development and production. We also provide services and products as a subcontractor to other oilfield service companies operating as prime contractors. Customers for these services typically award contracts on a competitive-bid basis. These contracts are typically less than one year in duration, although we enter into multi-year contracts from time to time.
In connection with the services we perform in our Oilfield business, we generally seek contracts that compensate us on a dayrate basis. Under dayrate contracts, the contractor provides the ROV, vessel or equipment and the required personnel to operate the unit and compensation is based on a rate per day for each day the unit is used. The typical dayrate depends on market conditions, the nature of the operations to be performed, the duration of the work, the equipment and services to be provided, the geographical areas involved and other variables. Dayrate contracts may also contain an alternate, lower dayrate that applies when a unit is moving to a new site or when operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather or water conditions or other conditions beyond the contractor's control. Sales contracts for our products are generally for a fixed price.
Advanced Technologies.  We market our marine services and related engineering services to government agencies, major defense contractors, NASA and NASA contractors, and to theme park and other commercial customers outside the energy sector. 
Major Customers. Our top five customers in 2016, 2015 and 2014 accounted for 43%, 38% and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. In 2016, four of our top five customers were oil and gas exploration and production companies served by our Oilfield business segments, with the other one being the U.S. Navy or other parts of the U.S. Government, which is served by our Advanced Technologies segment. In 2015 and 2014, all of our top five customers were oil and gas exploration and production companies served by our Oilfield business segments. During each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, revenue from one customer, BP plc and subsidiaries, accounted for 18% of our total consolidated annual revenue. 
While we do not depend on any one customer, the loss of one of our significant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
RAW MATERIALS
Most of the raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations, such as steel in various forms, copper, electronic components and plastics, are available from many sources. However, some components we use to manufacture subsea umbilicals are available from limited sources. With the exception of certain kinds of steel tube, where we are limited in the number of available suppliers, we can offer alternative materials or technologies in many cases, which depends on the requisite approval of our customers. While we have experienced some level of difficulty in obtaining certain kinds of steel tube in the past due to global demand outstripping capacity, an increase in supplier 
7

capacity, coupled with a drop in global demand, has resolved this issue, and we believe the situation is unlikely to recur in the near future. 
COMPETITION
Our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments.
Oilfield
We are one of several companies that provide underwater services and specialty subsea hardware on a worldwide basis. We compete for contracts with companies that have worldwide operations, as well as numerous others operating locally in various areas. We believe that our ability to provide a wide range of underwater services and products on a worldwide basis enables us to compete effectively in all phases of the offshore oilfield life cycle. In some cases involving projects that require less sophisticated equipment, small companies have been able to bid for contracts at prices uneconomical to us. Additionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete.
ROVs. We believe we are the world's largest owner/operator of work-class ROVs employed in oil and gas related operations. At December 31, 2016, we owned 280 work-class ROVs, and we estimate that this represented approximately 28% of the work-class ROVs utilized in the oilfield service industry. We compete with several major companies on a worldwide basis and with numerous others operating locally in various areas.
Competition for ROV services historically has been based on equipment availability, location of or ability to deploy the equipment, quality of service and price. The relative importance of these factors can vary over time based on market conditions. The ability to develop improved equipment and techniques and to train and retain skilled personnel is also an important competitive factor in our markets. Demand for ROVs has been decreasing since mid 2014 due to the oil price environment, and our margins have decreased in recent periods due to lower utilization and pricing pressure, as price has become a more important factor in the current oil price environment.
Subsea Products. There are many competitors offering specialized products. We are one of several companies that compete on a worldwide basis for the provision of thermoplastic and steel tube subsea control umbilicals, and compared to current and forecasted market demand, we are faced with overcapacity in the umbilical manufacturing market.
Subsea Projects. We perform subsea intervention and hardware installation services, principally in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola and India, from two owned and three chartered multiservice deepwater vessels. We are one of many companies that offer these services. In general, our competitors can move their vessels to where we operate from other locations with relative ease. We also have many competitors that supply commercial diving services to the oil and gas industry in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Our survey and positioning services are similarly competitive.
Asset Integrity. The worldwide asset integrity and inspection markets consist of a wide range of inspection and certification requirements in many industries. We compete in only selected portions of this market. We believe that our broad geographic sales and operational coverage, long history of operations, technical reputation, application of various pipeline inspection technologies and accreditation to international quality standards enable us to compete effectively in our selected asset integrity and inspection services market segments.
Advanced Technologies
Engineering services is a very broad market with a large number of competitors. We compete in specialized areas in which we can combine our extensive program management experience, mechanical engineering expertise and the capability to continue the development of conceptual project designs into the manufacture of custom equipment for customers.

SEASONALITY AND BACKLOG
We generate a material amount of our consolidated revenue from contracts for services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in our Subsea Projects segment, which is usually more active in the second and third quarters, as compared to the rest of the year. The European operations of our Asset Integrity segment are also seasonally more active in the second and third quarters. Revenue in our ROV segment is subject to seasonal variations in demand, with our first quarter generally being the low quarter of the year. The level of our ROV seasonality depends on the number of ROVs we have engaged in vessel-based subsea infrastructure inspection, maintenance, repair and installation, which is more seasonal than drilling support. Revenue in each of our Subsea Products and Advanced Technologies segments has generally not been seasonal.
The amounts of backlog orders we believed to be firm as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions):


 | As of December 31, 2016 | | As of December 31, 2015
 | Total | | 1+ yr* | | Total | | 1+ yr*
Oilfield | | | | | | | 
ROVs | $ | 498 | | | $ | 263 | | $ | 890 | $ | 459

Total | $ | 1,553 | | | $ | 507 | | $ | 2,515 | $ | 944

 *    Represents amounts that were not expected to be performed within one year.
No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts by the U.S. government.
PATENTS AND LICENSES
We currently hold numerous of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications. We have acquired patents and licenses and granted licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations.
REGULATION
Our operations are affected from time to time and in varying degrees by foreign and domestic political developments and foreign, federal and local laws and regulations, including those relating to:

• | operating from and around offshore drilling, production and marine facilities;


• | national preference for local equipment and personnel;


• | marine vessel safety;


• | protection of the environment;


• | workplace health and safety;


• | taxation of earnings;


• | license requirements for exportation of our equipment and technology; and


• | currency conversion and repatriation.

In addition, our Oilfield business depends on the demand for our services and products from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing offshore exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic and other policy reasons would adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.
Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed.
Environmental laws and regulations that apply to our operations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (each, as amended) and similar laws that provide for responses to, and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Environmental laws and regulations also include similar foreign, state or local counterparts to the above-mentioned federal laws, which regulate air emissions, water discharges, hazardous substances and waste, and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, primarily, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We cannot predict all of the environmental requirements or circumstances that will exist in the future but anticipate that environmental control and protection standards will become increasingly stringent and costly. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future.
Our quality management systems are registered as being in conformance with ISO 9001:2000 and cover:

For a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations, see the discussion in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" under the heading "Our international operations involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations."
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the "safe harbor" protection for forward-looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords.
From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our company. These statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future orders, revenue, income and capital spending. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate," "plan," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "forecast," "budget," "goal," "may," "should," or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In addition, sometimes we will specifically describe a statement as being a forward-looking statement and refer to this cautionary statement.
In addition, various statements this report contains, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention are forward-looking statements. Those forward-looking statements appear in Part I of this report in Item 1 – "Business," Item 2 – "Properties" and Item 3 – "Legal Proceedings" and in Part II of this report in Item 7 – "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," Item 7A – "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated into Item 8 and elsewhere in this report. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, we disclaim any obligation to update these statements, and we caution you not to rely unduly on them. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following:

• | worldwide demand for and prices of oil and gas;


• | changes in, or our ability to comply with, government regulations, including those relating to the environment;


• | the continued availability of qualified personnel;


• | general economic and business conditions and industry trends;


• | the volatility and uncertainties of credit markets;


• | the highly competitive nature of our businesses;


• | decisions about offshore developments to be made by oil and gas exploration, development and production companies;

11


• | cancellations of contracts, change orders and other contractual modifications and the resulting adjustments to our backlog;


• | collections from our customers;


• | the use of subsea completions and our ability to capture associated market share;


• | the strength of the industry segments in which we are involved;


• | the levels of oil and gas production to be processed by the Medusa field production spar platform;


• | our future financial performance, including availability, terms and deployment of capital;


• | the consequences of significant changes in currency exchange rates;


• | changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretation by taxing authorities;


• | our ability to obtain raw materials and parts on a timely basis and, in some cases, from limited sources;


• | operating risks normally incident to offshore exploration, development and production operations;


• | hurricanes and other adverse weather and sea conditions;


• | cost and time associated with drydocking of our vessels;


• | adverse outcomes from legal or regulatory proceedings;


• | the risks associated with integrating businesses we acquire;


• | rapid technological changes; and


• | social, political, military and economic situations in foreign countries where we do business and the possibilities of civil disturbances, war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks.

We believe the items we have outlined above are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in a forward-looking statement made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf. We have discussed most of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this report. These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update our description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises. We advise our security holders that they should (1) be aware that important factors we do not refer to above could affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and (2) use caution and common sense when considering our forward-looking statements.
