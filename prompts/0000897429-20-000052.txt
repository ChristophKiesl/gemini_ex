ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Founded in 1983, Chico’s FAS, Inc.1, is a leading omnichannel specialty retailer of women's private branded, sophisticated, casual-to-dressy apparel, intimates and complementary accessories. We operate under the Chico's®, White House Black Market® ("WHBM"), Soma® and TellTaleTM brand names. As of February 1, 2020, we operated 1,341 stores across 46 states, Puerto Rico, the United States ("U.S.") Virgin Islands and Canada, and sold merchandise through 70 international franchise locations in Mexico and 2 domestic airport locations. We refer to our Chico's and WHBM brands collectively as our "Apparel Group" and refer to our Soma and TellTale brands collectively as our "Intimates Group." Our distinct lifestyle brands serve the needs of fashion-savvy women 35 years and older. We earn revenue and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our domestic and international retail stores, our various Company-operated e-commerce websites, our call center (which takes orders for all of our brands), through unaffiliated franchise partners and through third-party channels. 
We utilize an integrated, omnichannel approach to managing our business. We want our customers to experience our brands holistically and to view the various retail channels we operate as a single, integrated experience rather than as separate sales channels operating independently. This approach allows our customers to browse, purchase, return or exchange our merchandise through whatever sales channel and at whatever time is most convenient. As a result, we track total sales and comparable sales on a combined basis.
We offer high quality and unique merchandise, supported by outstanding personalized customer service. While each of our brands has a distinct customer base, the overall portfolio caters to a broad age and economic demographic, with household incomes in the moderate to high income level.
Our fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to January 31 and are designated by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the fiscal years ended February 1, 2020 (“fiscal 2019”, “2019” or “current period”), February 2, 2019 (“fiscal 2018”, “2018” or “prior period”), February 3, 2018 (“fiscal 2017” or “2017”), January 28, 2017 (“fiscal 2016” or “2016”) and January 30, 2016 (“fiscal 2015” or “2015”). Each of these periods had 52 weeks, except for fiscal 2017, which consisted of 53 weeks. 
Our Brands
The Company's brands, described in more detail below, are organized into three operating segments and aggregated into one reportable segment due to the similarities of the economic and operating characteristics of the brands.
Chico’s
Our Chico’s brand began operations in 1983 and primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 45 and older. The style sensibility is unique with an individual expression created to illuminate the women wearing the brand. Chico's apparel, including the Black Label, Zenergy and Travelers collections, emphasizes problem solving styles, comfort and relaxed fit. Accessories and jewelry are original and designed to elevate the clothing assortment, allowing our customer to individualize her personal style. 
The distinctive nature of Chico’s clothing is also reflected in its sizing, which is comprised of sizes 000, 00 (size 0-2), 0 (size 4-6), 1 (size 8-10), 2 (size 12-14), 3 (size 16-18) and 4 (size 20-22). Chico’s will occasionally offer half-sizes (up to 3.5), one-size-fits-all, petite sizes, short and tall inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The relaxed fit allows us to utilize this kind of sizing and thus offer a wide selection of clothing without investing in a large number of sizes within a single style.

1 | As used in this report, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company,” refer to Chico’s FAS, Inc., a Florida corporation, and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Chico's is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of pattern, print, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers. 
White House Black Market
The WHBM brand began operations in 1985 and was acquired by the Company in September 2003. WHBM is dedicated to being a go-to style destination and authority on wardrobe building. WHBM primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 35 and older. WHBM offers a modern collection to support her every lifestyle moment, selling stylish and versatile clothing and accessory items, including everyday basics, polished casual apparel, relaxed workwear, black and white pieces, and feminine all-occasion dresses. The accessories at WHBM, such as shoes, belts, scarves, handbags and jewelry, are specifically designed to coordinate with each collection, allowing customers to easily individualize their wardrobe selections. 
WHBM uses American sizes in the 00-14 range (with online sizes up to 16), including petite sizing, as well as short and long inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The fit of the WHBM clothing is tailored to complement the figure of a body-conscious woman, while still remaining comfortable.
WHBM is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of patterns, prints, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers.
Intimates Group
The Soma brand, which began operations in 2004, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded lingerie, sleepwear and loungewear products focusing on women who want solutions that are as comfortable as they are beautiful. The Soma brand's core franchises emphasize innovative styles that focus on fit and uncompromising comfort, including Vanishing Back bras, Vanishing Edge panties, slimming leggings and Cool Nights sleepwear. 
Bras range in size from 32A-46H. The sleepwear and loungewear offerings range in size from extra small to extra-extra-large. 
The Soma team develops product offerings by working closely with a small number of independent suppliers to design proprietary products in-house and, in some cases, designs provided by its independent suppliers under labels other than the Soma brand.
The TellTale brand, which began operations in 2019, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded lingerie products focusing on women who know that their sensuality is their own, their comfort is a right, and their story is always unfolding. TellTale offers flattering fashion and quality intimate apparel choices at an attainable price. The TellTale core franchises focus on lounge bras, every-day and special occasion bras, and their matching panties. Bras range in size from 32A-40DD.
Our Business Strategy
Our overall business strategy is focused on building a collection of distinct high-performing retail brands serving the fashion needs of women 35 and older. The primary function of the Company is the production and procurement of beautiful merchandise that delivers the brand promise and brand positioning of each of our brands and resonates with customers. To that end, we are further strengthening our merchandise and design capabilities and enhancing our sourcing and supply chain to deliver product in a timely manner to our customers while also concentrating on improvements to the quality and aesthetic of our merchandise. Over the long term, we may build our brand portfolio by organic development or acquisition of other specialty retail concepts if research indicates that the opportunity complements our current brands and is appropriate and in the best interest of the shareholders.
We pursue improving the performance of our brands by building our omnichannel capabilities, managing our store base, growing our online presence, executing marketing plans, effectively leveraging expenses, considering additional sales channels and markets, and optimizing the merchandise offerings of each of our brands. We continue to invest heavily in our omnichannel capabilities so our customers can fully experience our brands in the manner they choose.
We view our stores and Company-operated e-commerce websites as a single, integrated sales function rather than as separate, independently operated sales channels. As a result, we maintain a shared inventory platform for our primary operations, allowing us to fulfill orders for all channels from our distribution center ("DC") in Winder, Georgia. Our domestic customers can return merchandise to a store or to our DC, regardless of the original purchase location. Using our enhanced “Locate” tool, we ship in-store orders from other locations directly to the customer, expediting delivery times while reducing our shipping costs. In addition, our shared inventory system, Endless Aisle, enables customers to make purchases online and ship from store. In fiscal 2019, we completed the implementation of our Buy On-Line, Pick-up In-Store (BOPIS) capability across all our brands, further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities.
We seek to acquire new customers and retain existing customers by leveraging existing customer-specific data and through targeted marketing, including digital marketing, social media, television, catalogs and mailers. We seek to optimize the potential of our brands with improved product offerings, potential new merchandise opportunities, and brand extensions that enhance the current offerings, as well as through our continued emphasis on our trademark “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We also will continue to consider potential alternative sales channels for our brands, including international franchise, wholesale, licensing and other opportunities.
In fiscal 2018, we launched multiple initiatives that utilize technology and new platforms to drive growth such as Endless Aisle and STYLECONNECTTM (which enables store associates to personalize the customer experience). As a result of these multi-year initiatives, we have the technology and tools in place to leverage our omnichannel capabilities, which should allow us to capture and stay connected with our customers, whether in-store or online. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company announced a three-year retail fleet optimization plan to rebalance the mix between our physical store presence and our digital network. This initiative is part of the Company's efforts to better capitalize on its omnichannel platform, reduce costs, and improve our profitability and return on invested capital. We closed 94 underperforming stores since the announcement of our plan, with anticipated closures of approximately 60 to 70 stores in fiscal 2020. We will continue to re-evaluate each prospective store closure in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 against anticipated improvements in our sales trends and modify our closure plan as appropriate.
On April 24, 2019, the Company announced a Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") transition plan and appointed Bonnie Brooks, former Vice Chair, President and CEO of Hudson’s Bay Company and a member of the Company's Board, as Interim CEO of the Company. Ms. Brooks made significant changes to leadership and reset the Company’s priorities for growth and value creation in fiscal 2019. Actions are underway across the brands with a focus on three distinct areas that we believe will positively impact results. These operating priorities are: 

• | Driving stronger sales through improved product and marketing;


• | Optimizing the customer journey by simplifying, digitizing and extending our unique and personalized service; and


• | Transforming our sourcing and supply chain operations to increase product speed to market and improve quality.

On July 18, 2019, the Company announced the appointment of Ms. Brooks as CEO and President of Chico's FAS, Inc. and a new leadership structure to drive a simpler, nimbler organization. The responsibility of our apparel brands, Chico’s and WHBM, was consolidated under one leader, Molly Langenstein, President, Apparel Group, to create clear lines of responsibility and accelerate sales driving priorities. The Company’s intimates brands, Soma and TellTale, are led by Mary van Praag, President, Intimates Group.
During the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Ms. Brooks continued her consolidation and transformation efforts at the Company. As a result of these efforts, the Company took action to reduce costs and reposition its organizational structure. The Company also reported its first quarter of positive comparable sales for all three brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, as it continued to deliver on each of its strategic priorities as discussed above.
Our Customer Service Model
We strive to deliver outstanding and personalized customer service to our customers through our trademark “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We believe this service model is one of our competitive advantages and a key to our continued success. An important aspect to the successful implementation of this model includes specialized training provided to our sales associates to help them better meet their customers’ fashion and wardrobe needs. Such needs may include clothing and accessory style, color selection, coordination of complete outfits and suggestions on different ways to wear the clothing and accessories. Our sales associates are encouraged to develop long-term relationships with their customers, to know their customers’ preferences and to assist our customers in selecting merchandise best suited to their tastes and wardrobe needs. Our brands utilize STYLECONNECT to access customer purchase history and style preferences as a clienteling tool that enhances the shopping experience in a personalized and efficient manner. 
We also serve our customers’ needs and build customer loyalty through our customer rewards programs. Our programs are designed to reward our loyal customers by leveraging the rich data our customers share with us to deliver a relevant and engaging experience with our brands. The benefits provided are routinely evaluated in conjunction with our overall customer relationship management and marketing activities to ensure they remain a compelling reason for customers to shop at our brands.

• | Chico’s. A Chico’s customer can join the “Passport” program at no cost and receive additional benefits after spending a fixed amount. Features of the program include a 5% discount, exclusive offers, special promotions, free shipping, invitations to private sale events and advance notice regarding new arrivals.


• | WHBM. With “WHBM Rewards”, a customer can join at no cost for tier-based discounts, a 5% discount after spending a specified amount, free shipping, special promotions and invitations to private sales based on annual spend.


• | Soma. A Soma customer can join “Love Soma Rewards” at no cost and earns points based on purchases. Features of the program include reward coupons at specified loyalty point levels, exclusive promotions and free shipping.

Our Boutiques and Outlet Stores
Our boutiques are located in upscale indoor shopping malls, outdoor shopping areas and standalone street-front locations in the U.S., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. Boutique locations are determined based on various factors, including, but not limited to: market and demographic characteristics, nearby competitors, our own network of existing boutiques, the location of the shopping venue, including the site within the shopping center, proposed lease terms, anchor or other co-tenants, parking accommodations and convenience. Our merchandise is also sold through international franchise locations in Mexico, including boutique locations as well as shop-in-shop formats within a department store environment. 
Our outlet stores are primarily located in quality outlet centers. The Chico’s and WHBM brand outlets contain a mixture of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise. The made-for-outlet product carries a higher margin than the clearance items from our boutique stores. Soma outlets contain a mix of boutique and clearance merchandise. We also sell clearance merchandise on our websites. We regularly review the appropriate ratio of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise sold at our outlets and adjust that ratio as appropriate.
As of February 1, 2020, we operated 1,341 retail stores in 46 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada, and sold merchandise through 70 international franchise locations in Mexico and 2 domestic airport locations. The following tables set forth information concerning our retail stores during the past five fiscal years:

As part of our retail fleet optimization plan, we closed 94 underperforming stores since the announcement of our plan, with anticipated closures of approximately 60 to 70 stores in fiscal 2020. We also plan to invest in opening approximately 10 Soma stores in fiscal 2020. We continuously evaluate the appropriate store base in light of economic conditions and our business strategy and may adjust the openings and closures as conditions require or as opportunities arise. 
Information Technology/Data Analytics
We are committed to having information systems that enable us to obtain, analyze and act upon information on a timely basis and to maintain effective financial and operational controls. We periodically test new technologies and platforms to support and enhance our processes across all areas of our business. We use a proprietary customer database, together with data analytics, to customize our communications and make targeted offers to customers in an effort to increase traffic in-store and online and to increase conversion.
Digital Commerce
Each of our brands has a digital flagship: www.chicos.com, www.whbm.com, www.soma.com and www.mytelltale.com, which provide customers the ability to browse and order merchandise, locate our stores and engage with content to enhance the shopping experience. We also offer www.chicosofftherack.com, our e-commerce website that gives customers 24/7 access to the same exclusive styles available at our Chico's Outlet locations. 
Our websites are designed to complement the in-store experience and play a vital role in both our omnichannel strategy and the customer experience. Some products are available exclusively online including extended sizes, additional style and color choices, premier partner brands and clearance items. Online merchandise is also available for order through our call center, through clienteling applications in our stores and through third parties. We also utilize ecommerce solutions, such as ShopRunner, and are exploring new digital opportunities to expand our customer base and drive sales. 
We remain focused on our omnichannel approach by ongoing enhancements to all brand websites through new features, functionality, search engine optimization and content designed to improve and evolve the customer's experience. 
Marketing and Advertising 
Our brands use industry-leading transactional data to develop targeted and effective marketing strategies. To optimize our marketing efforts and to attract new customers, we continue to shift our advertising from traditional media, instead placing more emphasis on digital media. We also use predictive modeling and advanced segmentation methodologies to drive customer retention and reactivation. 
We use the following marketing and media-mix programs to engage current customers and attract prospective customers:

• | Loyalty and rewards programs;


• | Direct marketing: catalogs, postcards, email and calling campaigns;


• | Digital marketing: mobile paid search, product listing ads, display banner advertising and remarketing, affiliate programs;


• | Social marketing: organic and paid efforts across social platforms;


• | National and local print and broadcast advertising;


• | Editorial content;


• | Public relations; and


• | Charitable giving and outreach programs.

In 2020, our marketing efforts will focus on retaining existing, reactivating lapsed customers and attracting new customers to our iconic brands' differentiated positioning by leveraging retail science and introducing alternative sales channels.
Product Sourcing
Our product sourcing activities are performed by a centralized shared service team that is focused on maintaining our quality standards and identifying cost-effective opportunities to improve production speed and flexibility. During fiscal 2019, China sourced product accounted for approximately 46% of our merchandise cost. We take ownership of merchandise either in the foreign country, at a designated point of entry into the U.S., or at our DC, depending on the specific terms of sale. 
To support our supply chain strategy, we continue to reduce our exposure in China by diversifying into other countries of origin. We expect to continue reducing our exposure to tariffs in 2020, with tactics such as diversifying country of origin, and managing and adjusting our forward buys and product pricing. We are monitoring the development of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and may adjust our product sourcing activities accordingly. 
The majority of our merchandise is purchased through core suppliers with whom we have established strategic collaborations; these core suppliers represented 72% of our purchases in fiscal 2019 with our largest supplier accounting for 19% of the total. 
 Substantial work was done to reduce the supply base starting in fiscal 2017. As of February 1, 2020, the supply base count was reduced by approximately 47%. Throughout 2020, we expect to focus on developing and perfecting relationships with those core suppliers. As we reach scale, we believe we will have stronger partnerships, greater control over product quality, and the ability to achieve better terms and lower costs. We intend to supplement the remaining volume with a subset of market suppliers to meet any unique needs of the brands.
Merchandise Distribution
The distribution function for our brands is primarily handled from our DC in Winder, Georgia. New merchandise is generally received daily at the DC. Imported merchandise is shipped from the country-of-export either by sea, air, truck or rail, as circumstances require. Domestic merchandise is primarily shipped by truck or rail. Upon arrival at our DC, merchandise is sorted and packaged for shipment to individual stores or is held for future store replenishment and direct shipment to customers. Merchandise is generally pre-ticketed with price and related informational tags at the point of manufacture. 
Our DC has been granted Foreign Trade Zone status from both the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This status facilitates international expansion and allows us to move certain merchandise into the DC without paying U.S. Customs duty until the merchandise is subsequently shipped to domestic stores or online customers.
Competition
The women’s retail apparel and intimate apparel business is highly competitive and includes local, national and international department stores, specialty stores, boutique stores, catalog companies and online retailers. We believe that our distinctively designed merchandise offerings and emphasis on customer service distinguish us from our competitors.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We are the owner of certain registered and common law trademarks and service marks (collectively referred to as “Marks”).
Our Marks include, but are not limited to: CHICO’S, CHICO'S PASSPORT, ZENERGY, SO SLIMMING, WHITE HOUSE BLACK MARKET, WHBM, WHBM REWARDS, SOMA, SOMA INTIMATES, ENTICING, COOL NIGHTS, EMBRACEABLE, ENBLISS, VANISHING, VANISHING BACK, VANISHING EDGE, LOVE SOMA REWARDS, STYLECONNECT, CHICO'S OFF THE RACK, WHITE HOUSE BLACK MARKET OFF THE RACK AND TELLTALE. We have registered or are seeking to register a number of these Marks in the U.S, Canada, Mexico and other foreign countries.
In the opinion of management, our rights in the Marks are important to our business. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our Marks and the related registrations and applications. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to our rights to use any registered Marks in the U.S.

Employees
As of February 1, 2020, we employed approximately 17,100 people, 28% of whom were full-time employees and the balance of whom were part-time employees. The number of part-time employees fluctuates during peak selling periods. As of the above date, approximately 90% of our employees worked in our boutique and outlet stores. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced any material labor disruption and are unaware of any efforts or plans to organize our employees. We consider the overall relations with our employees to be good.
