ITEM 1–BUSINESS
General
Inotiv, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“We,” “Our,” “us,” the “Company,” or “Inotiv”) is a leading contract research organization ("CRO") specializing in nonclinical and analytical drug discovery and development services to the pharmaceutical, chemical, and medical device industries, and sells analytical instruments to the pharmaceutical development and contract research industries. Our mission is to focus on bringing new drugs and medical devices through the discovery and preclinical phases of development, all while increasing efficiency, improving data, and reducing the cost of taking new drugs to market. Inotiv is committed to supporting discovery and development objectives as well as helping researchers realize the full potential of their critical R&D projects, all while working together to build a healthier and safer world. Our strategy is to provide services that will generate high-quality and timely data in support of new drug and product approval or expand their use. Our clients and partners include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, biomedical device, academic and government organizations. We believe that we offer an efficient, variable-cost alternative to our clients’ internal drug and product development programs. Outsourcing development work to reduce overhead and speed product approvals through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and other regulatory authorities is an established alternative to in-house product development efforts. We derive our revenues from sales of our research services and instruments, both of which are focused on evaluating drug and product safety and efficacy. The Company has been involved in the research of drugs and products to treat diseases in numerous therapeutic areas for over 47 years since its formation as a corporation organized in Indiana in 1974, under the name Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. On March 18, 2021, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and amended its Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended, to reflect a corporate name change from Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. to Inotiv, Inc.
We support both the non-clinical and clinical development needs of researchers and clinicians for primarily small molecule drug candidates, but also provide services to biotherapeutics and device companies. We believe that our scientists have the skills in analytical instrumentation development, chemistry, computer software development, pharmacology,

histology, pathology, physiology, medicine, surgery, analytical chemistry, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology to make the services and products we provide increasingly valuable to our current and potential clients. Our principal clients are scientists engaged in analytical chemistry, pharmacology, drug safety evaluation, clinical trials, drug metabolism studies, pharmacokinetics and basic research from small startup biotechnology companies to some of the largest global pharmaceutical companies. We are committed to bringing scientific expertise, quality and speed to every drug discovery and development program to help our clients develop safe and effective life-changing therapies.
Developments within the industries we serve have a direct, and sometimes material, impact on our operations. Currently, many large pharmaceutical companies have major "blockbuster" drugs that are nearing the end of their patent protections. This puts significant pressure on these companies to discover, acquire or develop new drugs with large market opportunity, and to re-evaluate their cost structures and the time-to-market of their products. CROs have benefited from these developments, as the pharmaceutical industry has turned to outsourcing to both reduce fixed costs and to increase the speed of research and data development necessary for new product applications. The number of significant drugs that have reached or are nearing the end of their patent protection has also benefited the generic drug industry. Generic drug companies provide a significant source of new business for CROs as they develop, test and manufacture their generic compounds.
A significant portion of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is now driven by smaller, venture capital funded drug discovery companies. Many of these companies are "single-molecule" entities, whose success depends on one or a few innovative compounds. While several biotech companies have reached the status of major pharmaceutical companies, the industry is still characterized by numerous smaller entities. These developmental companies generally do not have the resources to perform much of their research within their organizations and are therefore increasingly dependent on the CRO industry for both their research and for guidance in preparing their regulatory submissions. These companies have provided significant new opportunities for the CRO industry, including Inotiv. As reported by Frost and Sullivan, the non-clinical market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7% to reach an estimated $24 billion by 2026. We believe that the Company is ideally positioned to serve these clients as they look for alternatives to the large CROs that cater primarily to the large pharmaceutical company segment of the marketplace.

Industry Overview
Drug discovery and development is the process of creating drugs for the treatment of human and animal disease. The drug discovery process aims to identify potential drug candidates, while the drug development process involves the testing of these drug candidates in animals and humans to meet requirements for regulatory approval. The process for researching and developing new medicines is growing in difficulty and length. On average, it takes at least ten years for a new medicine to complete the journey from initial discovery to the marketplace, with clinical trials alone taking six to seven years on average. The average cost to research and develop each successful drug is estimated to be $2.6 billion. This number incorporates the cost of failures, as only a few of the thousands and sometimes millions, of compounds that may be screened and assessed early in the R&D process, will ultimately receive regulatory approval. The overall probability of clinical success (the likelihood that a drug entering clinical testing will eventually be approved) is estimated to be less than 10%.
The CRO industry provides independent product development services to pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and government organizations. This industry has evolved from providing limited clinical trial services in the 1970s to a full-service industry today characterized by broader relationships with clients and by service offerings that encompass the entire drug discovery and development process, including non-clinical efficacy and safety evaluations, study design, clinical trial management, data collection, biostatistical analyses, regulatory consulting, clinical laboratory and diagnostic services, pre- and post-approval safety analysis, product registration and post-approval support.
Over the past few decades, technological advances, as well as the emergence of the biotechnology industry, have dramatically changed the drug discovery process. New and improved technologies have evolved such as ultra-high-throughput screening, new in vitro and in vivo preclinical profiling techniques and the gene-based drug research commonly referred to as genomics. The objective of these innovations is to find more drug targets and to screen chemical compounds against targets much more quickly, with literally millions of compounds possible. This process is expected to produce many more molecules having the ability to affect biological activity. These molecules then need to be tested quickly and economically to determine their viability as potentially safe and effective drug candidates.
Trends Affecting the Drug Discovery and Development Industry
Our services and products are primarily marketed globally to pharmaceutical, medical research and biotechnology companies and institutions (academic and governmental) engaged in drug research and development. The research services industry is highly fragmented among many niche vendors as well as a small number of consolidating larger companies; the latter offer an ever-growing portfolio of start-to-finish pharmaceutical development services. Our services and products may have distinctly different clients (including separate divisions in a single large pharmaceutical company) and requirements. We believe that market trends in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries demonstrate an increasing emphasis towards outsourcing, as companies seek to maintain reduced internal resources in favor of variable cost models that offer high quality and higher accountability alternatives to meet their drug discovery, development and manufacturing needs. We believe that our clients are facing increased pressure to outsource facets of their research and development activities and that the following factors will increase client outsourcing.
Limited Research Model Availability
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and CRO’s have experienced significant limitations in their access to animal research models, specifically including a sharp reduction in the availability of non-human primates (NHP) originating from breeding farms in Southeast Asia and limited access to the generation of genetically-modified rodent models used in efficacy evaluations. Prior to the pandemic, China was the leading exporter of NHP’s employed in basic and applied research; however, early in 2021, China ceased exportation of cynomolgus monkeys, the species most commonly involved in pharmaceutical product development. This change in the world supply of this critical research model has resulted in increased demand from breeding farms principally located in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Mauritius Island, with a resultant marked increase in unit pricing. China’s internal consumption of its domestically-produced research models is not expected to decrease, nor is a loosening of its embargo on their exportation in the future.

Accelerated Drug Development
Clients continue to demand faster, more efficient, more selective development of an increasing pool of drug and device candidates. Consequently, our clients require fast, high-quality service in order to make well-informed decisions to quickly exclude poor candidates and speed development of successful ones. The need for additional development capacity to exploit more opportunities, accelerate development, extend market exclusivity and increase profitability drives the demand for outsourced services.
Increase in Potential New Drug Candidates
While research and development spending and the number of drug candidates are increasing, the time and cost required to develop a new drug or device candidate have also generally increased. Many small and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies do not have sufficient internal resources to pursue development of all of the new drug and device candidates on their own. Consequently, these companies are looking to the drug discovery and development services industry for cost-effective, innovative and rapid means of developing new drugs.
Cost Pressures of Introducing New Drugs
Market forces, healthcare reform and other governmental initiatives place significant pressures on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to reduce drug prices. In addition, increased competition as a result of patent expiration, market acceptance of generic drugs, and governmental and privately managed care organization efforts to reduce healthcare costs have added to drug pricing pressures. The pharmaceutical industry is responding by consolidating, streamlining operations, decentralizing internal discovery and development processes, and minimizing fixed costs. In addition, increased pressures to differentiate products and justify drug pricing are resulting in an increased focus on healthcare economics, safety monitoring and commercialization services. Moreover, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to increase the speed and efficiency of internal new drug discovery and development processes.
Patent Expiration
As exclusivity ends with patent expiry, drug companies defend their proprietary positions against generic competition with various patent extension strategies. Both the drug company pursuing these extensions and the generic competitors provide additional opportunities for the Company.
Alliances
Strategic alliances allow pharmaceutical companies to share research know-how and to develop and market new drugs faster in more diverse, global markets. We believe that such alliances will lead to a greater number of potential drugs in testing, many under study by small and virtual companies lacking broad technical resources. These small companies can add shareholder value by further developing new products through outsourcing, reducing risk for potential allies. Clients seek realistic business partnerships with their service provider in an effort to ensure that costs are controlled and scientific continuity is maintained as their development programs progress. We have long-standing business relationships with many pharmaceutical companies and continue to offer flexible services and adapt to our clients’ requirements.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry as well as its supporting contract research industry is commonplace. As pharmaceutical industry firms blend personnel, resources and business activities, we believe they will continue to streamline operations and minimize staffing, which will lead to more outsourcing and a dependence on small and virtual drug discovery efforts to feed their pipelines. Consolidation may result in a disruption in the progress of drug development programs as merging companies rationalize their respective drug development pipelines. In addition, we believe that recent consolidation within the contract research industry has created a unique opportunity for the emergence of mid-market CRO providers who can offer clients a high degree of “touch” not only in study execution, but in program design and regulatory agency interactions.

Biotechnology Industry and Virtual Drug Company Growth
The U.S. biotechnology industry has grown rapidly over the last two decades and has emerged as a key client segment for the drug discovery and development services industry. In recent years, this industry has generated significant numbers of new drug candidates that will require development and regulatory approval. Many biotechnology drug developers do not have sufficient in-house resources to conduct early stage drug development. Many new companies choose only to carry a product to a developed stage sufficient to attract a partner who will manufacture and market the drug. Because of the time and cost involved, these companies rely heavily on CROs to conduct research for their drug candidates.
Unique Technical Expertise
The increasing complexity of new drug candidates requires highly specialized, innovative, solution-driven research not available in all client labs. We believe that this need for unique technical expertise will increasingly lead to outsourcing of research activity. We believe further that the reliance of the pharmaceutical industry on small innovative drug discovery companies, which are often overlooked by large CROs, creates an opportunity for strategic partnership with small, consulting-based and innovative CROs such as ours.
Data Management and Quality Expertise
Our clients and worldwide regulatory authorities require more data, greater access to that data, consistent and auditable management of that data, and greater security and control of that data. We have made investments in software throughout our contract services groups to optimize efficiency and promote compliance with regulations and market expectations.
Globalization of the Marketplace
Foreign firms rely on independent development companies like ours with experience in the U.S. to provide integrated services through all phases of product development and to assist in preparing complex regulatory submissions. Domestic drug firms are broadening product availability globally, demanding local regulatory approval. We believe that we and other domestic service providers with global reach, established regulatory expertise, and a broad range of integrated development services and products will benefit from this trend.
Our Solution
We address the needs of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as academic, non-profit and government organizations, for drug discovery and development by providing integrated products and services to help our clients maximize the return on their research and development investments. We have focused on securing critical supply chain issues particularly related to research models. Our application of innovative technologies and products and our commitment to quality throughout the drug discovery and development process offer our clients a way to identify and develop successful drugs and devices more quickly and cost-effectively. We have obtained significant drug development expertise from more than 47 years of operation, and during 2021 we have added to our CRO service offerings through expansion of current facilities, acquisitions and startup initiatives to build new service offerings internally.
The Company’s Role in the Drug Development Process
In addition to providing research support prior to identification of new product candidates, after a new drug candidate is identified and carried through this preliminary screening, the development process for new drugs has three distinct phases.
1)           The nonclinical phase includes safety testing to prepare an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application for submission to the FDA. The IND must be accepted by the FDA before the drug candidate can be initially tested in humans. Once a pharmacologically active molecule is fully analyzed to confirm its potential utility, the initial dosage form for 

8



clinical trials is created. An analytical chemistry method is developed to enable reliable quantification. Stability and purity of the formulation are also determined.
Clients work with our nonclinical services group to establish initial pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety characteristics of the drug candidate. The safety studies range from dose ranging studies, that involve acute safety evaluation of drug candidates and medical devices to chronic, multi-year oncogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies. Dose formulation analysis is provided by our pharmaceutical analysis group. Bioanalyses of blood sampled under these protocols by our bioanalytical services group provide pharmacokinetic and metabolism data that is used with the safety and toxicity information to determine the exposure required to demonstrate toxicity. A no observable adverse effect level is then established for the drug and sets the basis for future safety testing and clinical phase I studies. Upon successful completion of nonclinical safety studies, an IND submission is prepared and reviewed by FDA prior to initiation of human clinical trials.
Many of our products are designed for use in discovery and nonclinical development. The Culex® family of robotic automated dose delivery, blood and other biofluids sampling and physiological parameters measurement systems enable researchers to quickly and cost effectively determine PK/PD profiles of drugs in large and small animal models. The Culex® system allows experiments on freely moving conscious animals from early research for therapeutic target validation to lead optimization of compounds. Using the Culex® system, researchers are able to automatically dose and sample in-vivo to develop pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of drugs during early screening in rodents and other animals quickly and cost effectively. Our bioanalytical services group utilizes our depth of expertise in liquid chromatography with detection by mass spectrometry to support research, nonclinical and clinical programs. We also offer bioanalytical services that utilize electrochemistry, spectrophotometric (UV/Vis or fluorescence) and Corona Discharge detection as options. We have invested in robotics and mass spectrometry systems. Application of this technology allows us to rapidly develop and validate methods for new compounds and obtain information suitable for regulatory submission.
2)           The clinical phase further explores the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate in humans. The sponsor conducts Phase I human clinical trials in a limited number of healthy individuals to determine safety and tolerability. Bioanalytical assays determine the availability and metabolism of the active ingredient following administration. Expertise in method development and validation is critical, particularly for new chemical entities. During the clinical phase of development, additional non-clinical animal studies (including sub-chronic and chronic toxicology studies, carcinogenicity studies, reproductive toxicology studies) are performed to allow the drug to proceed through clinical development and to support product registration.
Exhaustive safety, tolerability and dosing regimens are established in patients in Phase II trials. Phase III clinical trials verify efficacy and safety. After successful completion of Phase III trials, the sponsor of the new drug submits a New Drug Application ("NDA") or Biologics License Application ("BLA") to the FDA requesting that the product be approved for marketing. Early manufacturing demonstrates production of the substance in accordance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") guidelines. Data are compiled in an NDA, or for biotechnology products a BLA, for submission to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug or product. The bioanalytical sample count per study grows rapidly from Phase I through Phase III. Phase II and III studies may take several years to complete, supported by well-proven and consistently applied analytical methods.
Our services include evaluation of bioequivalence and bioavailability to monitor the rate and extent to which a drug is available in the body and to demonstrate that the availability is consistent between formulations. We also offer in-vitro bioequivalence testing for poorly absorbed oral drugs. We offer support and testing services in clinical sample development, release and stability.
3)           The Post-approval phase follows FDA approval of the NDA or BLA. This includes production and continued analytical and clinical monitoring of the drug. The post-approval phase also includes development and regulatory approval of product modifications and line extensions, including improved dosage forms. The drug manufacturer must comply with quality assurance and quality control requirements throughout production and must continue analytical and stability studies of the drug during commercial production to continue to validate production processes and confirm product shelf life. Samples from each manufactured batch must be tested prior to release of the batch for distribution to the public.

9



We also provide services during the post-approval phase, including bioequivalence studies of new formulations, line extensions, new disease indications and drug interaction studies. Our ability to offer GMP electrochemical detection services has provided increased business opportunities for release testing.
Increases in our services offerings have resulted in our ability to provide a broader range of services to our clients, often using combined services of several disciplines to address program needs. Our ability to solve problems by combining our knowledge base, services and products has been a factor in our selection by small startup biotechnology companies and major pharmaceutical companies to assist in several preclinical through post-approval phases.
Company Services and Products
Overview
We focus on developing innovative services and products that increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with taking new drugs to market. We operate in two business segments – contract research services and research products, both of which address the bioanalytical, nonclinical, and clinical research needs of drug and device developers. Both segments arose out of our expertise in a number of core technologies designed to quantify trace chemicals in complex matrices.
Contract Research Services
The contract research services segment provides screening and pharmacological testing, nonclinical safety testing, formulation development, regulatory compliance and quality control testing. Revenues from the contract research services segment were $85.8 million for fiscal 2021. The following is a description of the services provided by our contract research services segment:

Clients
We provide our services to companies engaged in pharmaceutical R&D. In fiscal 2021 we had sales to over 350 companies, ranging from emerging biopharmaceutical companies up to the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Approximately 4.7% and 6.7% of our sales were generated from clients outside of North America in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Repeat business from existing clients is important to ongoing operations. Our clients’ needs for our services increase and decrease depending on their research activities, so we experience some client turnover. Our business development efforts focus on generating client loyalty and also on the acquisition of new clients. In fiscal 2021, one client accounted for approximately 6.7% of total sales and 3.0% of total trade accounts receivable at September 30, 2021. In fiscal 2020 this client accounted for approximately 7.0% of total sales and 3.9% of total trade accounts receivable at September 30, 2020. The client discussed is included in our Services segment.
Sales and Marketing
We promote our services through concentrated business development efforts, scientist-to-scientist communications, centralized corporate marketing programs and social media to both pharmaceutical and medical device 

11



companies, as well as academic and government research institutions. We recognize that our growth depends upon our ability to continually improve client satisfaction in order to deepen existing, and create new, client relationships.
In November of 2019, the Company rebranded its contract research services business as “Inotiv.” Adoption of the tradename Inotiv symbolized the expansion and supplementation of the Company’s legacy contract research service operations through significant business acquisitions as well as internal growth. Since the rebranding, the Company has marketed and otherwise managed its contract research services operations under the name Inotiv. On March 18, 2021, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and amended its Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended, to reflect a corporate name change from Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. to Inotiv, Inc. The research product manufacturing division has continued to operate under the name BASi Research Products. BASi Research Products represents more than 45 years of developing niche instrumentation and supplies for commercial and academic partners in the fields of preclinical drug development, neuropharmacology, and electrochemistry research applications. Research product customers equate the BASi brand with high quality instrumentation and excellent scientific support, and maintaining the BASi name on these products provided trust and continuity. 
Our commercial initiatives include integrated campaigns designed to help differentiate and promote our products and services. Through trade events, digital and print advertising, direct communication, newsletters, social media, virtual exhibit space and our website, we provide our perspective on current industry challenges and developments to create an ongoing dialogue with our clients and to promote our industry expertise, quality, technology and innovation. Historically, we have reinforced key messages and selling points through client visits, presentations, corporate material and at trade events and industry conferences, although our participation at in-person events has been limited in fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We encourage and sponsor the participation of our scientific and technical personnel in a variety of professional endeavors, including via in-person and virtual speaking engagements, the presentation of papers at national and international professional trade meetings and the publication of scientific articles in medical and pharmaceutical journals, although these in-person endeavors were limited in fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through these endeavors we seek to further our reputation for professional excellence.
As of September 30, 2021, in addition to our leadership team and scientists, we had 22 employees on our commercial team supporting sales, marketing, client experience and program management for our services clients. To promote our products, we have a network of 20 established distributors covering Japan, South Korea, China, India, Central America, South America, South Africa, the Middle East and Europe. All of our distributor relationships are managed from our corporate headquarters in West Lafayette.
Contractual Arrangements
Our service contracts typically establish an estimated fee to be paid for identified services. In most cases, some percentage of the contract costs is paid in advance. While we are performing a contract, clients often adjust the scope of services to be provided based on interim project results. Fees are adjusted accordingly. Generally, our fee-for-service contracts are terminable by the client upon written notice of 30 days or less for a variety of reasons, including the client’s decision to forego a particular study, the failure of product prototypes to satisfy safety requirements, and unexpected or undesired results of product testing. Cancellation or delay of ongoing contracts may result in fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results. We are generally able to recover, at minimum, our invested costs when contracts are terminated.
Our products business offers both annual and multi-year service and maintenance agreements on many of our product lines.

Government Regulation
The Company is subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations and inspections designed to promote compliance therewith. We strive to conduct our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations by CROs may result in sanctions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action (including potential facilities improvement requirements), revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, criminal prosecution and even the denial of the right to conduct business. The Company holds a range of permits and licenses, related to its activities.
We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of our data and products and to government inspections and audits related thereto. These regulations include those promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended from time to time, and include Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP"), Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP"), Bioequivalence regulations (“BE”) and Good Clinical Practices ("GCP"). These requirements demand rigorous attention to research; development; safety; manufacturing quality control; employee training; detailed documentation; equipment and computer validation; promotion and advertising; careful tracking of changes and routine auditing of compliance. Noncompliance with these standards could result in disqualification of project data collected by the Company, which would substantially impact our ability to meet our obligations to clients, and, in severe cases, discontinuance of selected operations. The products and services we offer to international clients are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements, which vary from country to country. Since our formation, we have been inspected, on a routine basis, by the FDA at each of our locations.

14



We are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare and other regulations, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977), and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws. In particular, the relationships that we, and third parties that market and/or sell our products, have with purchasers of our products, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws, including those referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
The Company’s facilities and operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of human health and the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment and the storage, handling, use, treatment, disposal, and recycling of hazardous substances and wastes, as further described below. Such laws include, without limitation, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Resource, Conservation, and Recovery Act. As environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, it is likely the Company will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time.
Analytical Services
Laboratories that provide information included in INDs, NDAs and BLAs must conform to regulatory requirements that are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the testing process. Most of our contract research services are subject to government standards for laboratory practices that are embodied in regulations for GLP, GMP, BE and GCP. The FDA, Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory authorities require that test results submitted to such authorities be based on studies conducted in accordance with the regulations listed above. These requirements include but are not restricted to the following areas:

● | Resources – organization, personnel, facilities and equipment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rules – protocols and written procedures;
--+------------------------------------------


● | Characterization – test items and test systems;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Documentation – raw data, final report and archives; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality assurance unit – formalized internal audit function.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

We must also maintain reports for each study for specified periods for auditing by the study sponsor and by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other parts of the world. Regulatory monitoring authorities such as the FDA, have indicated an increased emphasis on the management of electronic records generated by computerized systems to ensure data integrity. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in the disqualification of data collected during the preclinical trial.
Nonclinical Services
Our animal research facilities are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including The Animal Welfare Act and the rules and regulations enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"). These regulations establish the standards for the humane treatment, care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities. Our animal research facilities maintain detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation necessary to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody. If the USDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable Animal Welfare Act standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. For continued noncompliance, the USDA may impose fines, suspend and/or revoke animal research licenses or confiscate research animals. In addition to being licensed by the USDA as a research facility, we are also accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International and have registered assurance with the NIH.

15



Quality Assurance and Information Technology
To promote compliance with applicable regulations, we have established quality assurance programs at our facilities, which include auditing of test data, personnel training, review of procedures and regular inspection of facilities. Regulatory guidelines serve as a basis for our Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) where applicable. On an ongoing basis, we endeavor to standardize SOPs across all relevant operations. We have both developed and purchased software to ensure compliant documentation, handling and reporting of laboratory-generated study data.
We adhere to 21 CFR Part 11 (FDA regulations on electronic records and electronic signatures that define the criteria under which electronic records and electronic signatures are considered to be trustworthy, reliable and equivalent to paper records). Our contract research operations were compliant with applicable U.S. FDA regulations (including 21 CFR Part 11) in our analytical, bioanalytical, toxicology, laboratory information management, and document management systems. Systems compliant with 21 CFR Part 11 were formally validated and released for use in regulated studies.
We manage our business systems through the use of an Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system. We are continually refining and adjusting our ERP system to improve efficiency, provide better management tools and address changes in our business. These changes are appropriately documented and tested before implementation. We also test these systems in connection with management’s annual review of our internal control systems. Management’s assessment and report on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting is included in Item 9A.
Controlled, Hazardous, and Environmentally Threatening Substances
Some of our development and testing activities are subject to the Controlled Substances Act administered by the Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA"), which strictly regulates all narcotic and habit-forming substances. We maintain restricted-access facilities and heightened control procedures for projects involving such substances due to the level of security and other controls required by the DEA.
Our laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste, as well as the safety and health of laboratory employees. All of our laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to the storage and disposal of laboratory specimens, including regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, the National Fire Protection Agency and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The Company may incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off-site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances. Generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, and state counterparts. CERCLA Imposes strict, joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators, site owners and operators, and other potentially responsible parties. The Company may be held liable for all costs arising out of any release of hazardous substances and for consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances, which costs may be material. In addition, changes in any environmental laws may increase costs of compliance and liabilities arising from any past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances and may materially adversely affect the business.
The regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. Our laboratories must also comply with the International Air Transport Association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens. Furthermore, when materials are sent to a foreign country, the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws, rules and regulations of such foreign country.
Safety
In addition to comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace generally, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus, chemicals and drugs, and 

16



respiratory hazards. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals, transmission of blood-borne and airborne pathogens, and other potential hazards. Relevant employees receive initial and periodic training focusing on compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines.
HIPAA
Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulates the disclosure of confidential medical information in the United States. We have had a global privacy policy in place since January 2001 and believe that we are in compliance with HIPAA and current European Union requirements regarding confidential medical information. We continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations, and we intend to take appropriate steps to promote compliance as these and other privacy regulations are revised or additional regulations come into effect.
Product Liability and Insurance
We maintain product liability and professional errors and omissions liability insurance, providing coverage on a claims-made basis. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we seek to manage our liability risk through contractual provisions to be indemnified by the client or covered by the client’s liability insurance policies. Also, in certain types of engagements, we seek to limit our contractual liability to clients to the amount of fees received. Our client contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation, and the terms and scope of indemnification, liability limitation and insurance coverage vary by client and project.
Research and Development
In fiscal 2021 and 2020, we spent $405 and $617, respectively, on research and development. In addition to research and development for additional contract research services, we maintain applications research and development to enhance our products business. Expenditures cover hardware and software engineering costs, laboratory supplies, labor, prototype development and laboratory demonstrations of new products and applications for those products.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Accordingly, we actively seek protection for those rights both in the United States and abroad. Where we deem it to be an appropriate course of action, we will vigorously prosecute patent infringements. The loss of any one or more of our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other proprietary rights could be material to our consolidated revenues or earnings.
We currently hold three U.S. federally registered trademarks. We also have two issued U.S. patents on the Dried Blood Spot (DBS) sampling card for the Culex® Automated Blood Sampling Instrumentation. There are also twelve issued international patents for this technology in Japan, Canada, Europe, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, and Sweden. Additionally, we have three issued U.S. patents for the Empis Automated Drug Infusion technology for the Culex® instrument. There are fourteen issued international patents for this technology in Europe, Japan, Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Ireland, Sweden, and Turkey. There is one additional issued U.S. patent and thirteen issued international patents in Belgium, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Europe, Spain, France, The United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Netherlands and Sweden relating to the No Blood Waste technology for the Culex® instrument. There is also one issued U.S. patent relating to pinch valve technology.
Our issued patents are protected for durations ranging from June of 2022 to February of 2034. In addition to these formal intellectual property rights, we rely on trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing applications research which we seek to protect through means of reasonable business procedures, such as confidentiality agreements.

Raw Materials
There are no specialized raw materials that are particularly essential to our business. We have a variety of alternative suppliers for the components in our products.
Human Capital Management
At September 30, 2021, we had 541 full-time employees and 26 part-time employees. All employees enter into confidentiality agreements intended to protect our proprietary information. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high. We believe that our employee benefit plans enhance employee morale, professional commitment and work productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with the Company.
Our primary objectives and philosophy of our compensation programs are to (i) drive leadership behaviors that maximize long-term stockholder value creation, (ii) attract and retain talented colleagues with the skills necessary to successfully manage and grow our business. 
Attracting, retaining, and developing talent is a core principle of our talent management and total rewards strategy. Compensation and benefit programs are an important part of our employment relationship, which also includes challenging and rewarding work, growth and career development opportunities and being part of a leading contract research organization with a diverse and talented workforce that helps develop life-changing therapies.

Envigo Business
We entered into a Merger Agreement with Envigo on September 21, 2021 and completed the Envigo Acquisition on November 5, 2021. Following completion of the Envigo Acquisition, Envigo is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Inotiv, Inc. In order to provide our shareholders and other investors with information that is relevant to our business, we are providing a description of Envigo's business below. References in this discussion to "Envigo" include Envigo and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
Overview
Envigo is primarily a products business that provides research-quality animals for use in laboratory tests, as well as standard and custom laboratory animal diets and bedding and other associated services for contract research organizations, biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governments and other research organizations. Envigo provides our customers with laboratory animals used in basic research and product development and non-clinical testing of compounds to support the development and approval of new medicines. Utilizing its portfolio of products, Envigo enables our customers to create a more flexible product development model and reduce their costs, enhance their productivity, and increase speed to market. Envigo's vision, working together to build a healthier and safer world, includes helping our customers meet certain regulatory requirements in order to bring life-saving and life-enhancing new medicines to patients.
Envigo is the second largest commercial provider of research model products and services globally and has been supplying research models since 1931. With over 130 different strains, Envigo is a global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains, and is able to offer the broadest range of species in our sector. Envigo also manufactures and sells premium Teklad brand diets for laboratory animals and provides a variety of related services that are designed to assist our clients in the use of animal models in research and development. Envigo maintains production centers, including barrier and isolator facilities, in the U.S., U.K., mainland Europe, and Israel.
Envigo's Market
The market for Envigo's services includes contract research organizations, biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governments and other research organizations.
Envigo offers a broad range of research-quality small and large animal models, research-quality standard and custom diets, as well as an associated suite of services to support the research community. Envigo's portfolio of products and services provides our customers vital support in their efforts to perform fundamental life sciences research, as well as developing life-saving and life-enhancing new medicines.
We believe that Envigo is well positioned to benefit from the following market trends:
Increased Research & Development (“R&D”) spending by biopharmaceutical companies. As reported by Frost and Sullivan, the non-clinical market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7% to reach an estimated $24 billion by 2026. Drivers of this growth include the increased complexity of studies required by global drug regulators to better predict safety and efficacy of compounds in development, and growth in personalized medicine leading to more targets for discovery and safety assessment work. 
Demand for NHPs. Since their inception in the 1980’s, biological therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, have been growing in importance as powerful new tools to manage and treat disease and, as such, have represented an increasing proportion of novel drugs in development. For many biotherapeutics, the ability to assess safety, which is a vital step in the development and approval of a new medicine, is critically dependent upon the ability of the potential drug to bind to its target receptor in the model organism. The closest animal model to a human is the non-human primate, and in many cases, this is the only species in which these developing medicines will bind. We believe the trend for increasing numbers of new biological therapies will continue and drive additional demand for NHPs. As the largest importer of NHPs in North America, with long-established relationships with the source breeders around the world, Envigo is favorably positioned for this trend.
Increasing research complexity and specificity. Over recent years, searching for new therapies has become increasingly complex and specific as our understanding of disease mechanisms and pathways has increased. 

19



Researchers have increasingly looked for specific ways to interact with the molecular pathways during disease development and progression. This has led to increasing demand for animal models that not only have those same, or similar, pathways, but models that have been altered so that, for example, critical elements of those pathways have been removed or replaced with the human versions. The ability to generate these altered animals relies on molecular tools that can alter the DNA of the animal to achieve the desired model, a so-called ‘transgenic’ animal model. These modified models are becoming increasingly important tools for researchers to better understand disease progression and pathology, and then to develop more highly-targeted therapies.
Envigo's Role in Drug Development
Envigo offers products and services that are critical to drug discovery, development and registration. Discovering and developing new drugs is an expensive and time-consuming process and is highly regulated. Before a new drug reaches commercialization, it must undergo extensive non-clinical and clinical testing to verify that it is safe and effective.
Drug discovery represents the earliest stages of research in new drug development, directed at the identification, screening, and selection of lead molecules for further development. During this stage, new molecules are tested for therapeutic value using various in silico, in vitro and in vivo models. Discovery activities typically extend anywhere from three to six years.
Envigo's laboratory animals and research models are extensively used by academic research centers, government agencies and biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other regulatory agencies require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested in research models like Envigo's prior to product registration. As a result, Envigo's research models are an essential part of the drug research and development process.
Envigo is unique in being the only provider that can supply the whole range of animal model species that regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, require for the safety assessment of both small chemical and biological new drugs.
Research Models and Services (“RMS”)
Envigo's RMS business is comprised of (1) Research Models, (2) Diets and Bedding, and (3) Research Model Services.
Research Models. Envigo's research models business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of laboratory animals and research models, principally purpose-bred rats and mice and large animal models (NHPs, canines and rabbits) for use by researchers. Envigo provides these models to numerous customers around the world, including many academic institutions, government agencies, biopharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations. Envigo has a global footprint with production facilities strategically located in six countries. Envigo's operations are located in close proximity to our customers, enabling it to provide top-tier customer service with a high degree of animal welfare.
Envigo's research models include standard stocks and strains, immunocompromised models (which are useful for oncology research), disease models (which are in demand as early-stage research tools) and genetically-engineered models (“GEMs”, which are often created for specific research projects). 
​
Small Animal Research Models. Envigo's rodent species have been, and continue to be, some of the most extensively used research models in the world, largely as a result of Envigo's geographic footprint and commitment to quality and customer service. Envigo's products create high customer loyalty, due to the strong preference of customers to avoid variability in their data and to work with an industry founder with more than 90 years of experience. Envigo's small animal research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments, which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents, and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort research results. With its production capabilities, Envigo strives to consistently deliver high-quality research models worldwide.
Envigo's rodent research models include:

●outbred, which are purposefully bred for heterogeneity;

20



●inbred, which are bred to be genetically identical;

● | spontaneous mutant, which contain a naturally occurring genetic mutation (such as immune deficiency);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●hybrid, which are the offspring of two different inbred parents; and
●GEMs.
Certain of Envigo's models are proprietary, disease-specific rodent models used to research treatments for diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and kidney disease.
Large Research Models. Envigo's large animal portfolio includes NHPs, canines and rabbits. NHPs are generally imported into the U.S. from Asia and Africa, with very limited breeding in the U.S. Envigo operates a large quarantine facility in the U.S. to house and clear these imported animals, ensuring they have high health status before onward shipment to customers. NHPs are used by our customers primarily for the safety testing of new biological therapies. Canines are purpose-bred in the U.S. and used primarily for the safety testing of new chemical therapies. Rabbits are bred in both the U.K. and U.S. and utilized primarily for the reproductive safety testing of potential new therapies.
Diets and Bedding. Through its Teklad product line, Envigo produces and sells laboratory animal diets, bedding, and enrichment products. With primary manufacturing operations in the U.S. and a primarily company-owned and/or managed distribution network throughout the U.S., U.K. and Europe, Envigo distributes Teklad products globally. Envigo also maintains contract-manufacturing relationships with companies in the U.K. and Italy. In October 2019, Envigo RMS, LLC (“Envigo U.S.”) entered into a master services agreement with Vanguard Supply Chain Solutions LLC (“Vanguard”) to provide transportation and warehousing services for its operations in the U.S. and Canada for research models and Teklad products. Prior to this agreement, Envigo had utilized internal resources to transport its research models and large laboratory animals, and transport and warehouse its Teklad products in those geographies. 
Teklad has been manufacturing animal diets for over 40 years and offers a full line of off-the-shelf formulations as well as custom diets to meet our customers’ specific research needs. A team of nutritionists, including several PhD’s, works with our customers to determine the best diet for their research objectives. If a custom diet is required, our nutritionists define the appropriate formula and our custom diet manufacturing line produces the feed. Our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9001:2008 certified.
Teklad diets are manufactured from natural ingredients and use fixed formulas. In conjunction with strict quality standards for raw materials, this approach ensures quality and consistency by minimizing variability of both nutrients and certain natural chemicals in the diet which might affect a research study. Teklad offers a variety of bedding and enrichment products to support model breeding, weaning, and holding.
Research Model Services. Envigo also offer a variety of services designed to support our customers' use of research models in basic research and product development. These services include specialized surgical modifications such as cannulation, implants, and the creation of surgically derived disease state models. Envigo also provides contract breeding, contract colony management, health monitoring, quarantine, cryopreservation, rederivation and revitalization services, as well as antibody development and production. In addition, Envigo offers care and boarding services for customer-owned animals at its facilities. Lastly, through the Envigo GEMS business, Envigo is able to offer the creation of new transgenic research models specific to individual customers’ needs.

Envigo's strategy is to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of research model products and services to support our customers’ research and development requirements, and enable them to conduct essential research faster and more cost effectively.


● | Strengthen existing and develop new strategic partnerships. Envigo believes its long-term relationships with a wide range of contract research organizations, academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies are a key driver of its success. Envigo plans to build on its diverse animal portfolios. In addition, the Envigo GEMS business offers transgenic models and associated services providing another product offering to our customers. We believe Envigo's global reach, high quality facilities and diverse line of animal models will enable us to provide additional services to our existing customers and develop relationships with new ones.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improve margins through focus on efficiency. Envigo's management and operational teams are continuously focused on improving productivity and optimizing our cost structure. Envigo continually reviews its network of operating facilities and distribution centers to ensure the most cost-efficient use of its footprint.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drive the human capital asset base to grow existing relationships. Envigo's employees are critical to its ability to deliver its operational model by engaging with customers, delivering products and services in a complex environment and supporting and executing its growth strategy. Employees undergo comprehensive initial orientation and ongoing training. Envigo's recruitment and retention efforts are geared towards maintaining a stable work force focused on delivering results for customers. We believe Envigo has a best-in-class pool of highly experienced animal technicians and research scientists.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquisitions. In June 2019, Envigo completed the acquisition of EGSI animal models from LabCorp’s Covance Drug Development segment, which diversified its animal model portfolio offerings. In addition, Envigo completed the acquisition of the Envigo GEMS assets from Horizon, which was accounted for as a business combination, which provides an opportunity to offer transgenic research model services to our existing and expanding customer base. We will continue to consider acquisitions that are complementary to Envigo's existing product offerings and that expand Envigo's ability to serve our customers. While we cannot exclude the possibility that Envigo may opportunistically take advantage of other situations, we generally expect acquisitions to enhance our existing product offerings either qualitatively or geographically or to add new products that can be integrated with our existing offerings.

​
Envigo continues to pursue a goal of expanding its relationships with customers through broadening its product and service offering.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support
Envigo sells its products and services principally through a direct sales force, inside sales team and account management teams who work throughout North America and Europe. In addition to interactions with the direct sales force, our primary promotional activities include a marketing mix of customer acquisition and customer retention tactics including organizing scientific symposia, publishing scientific papers and newsletters, hosting webinars and making presentations at, and participating in scientific conferences and trade shows in North America, Europe and Asia. Envigo supplements these scientifically-based marketing activities with internet-based marketing, advertising and direct mail.
Envigo has proven sales teams with the ability to build relationships with new customers and to grow within existing customers.
Envigo's internal marketing teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with our customers in the research community. Envigo maintains customer service, technical assistance and consulting service departments, which address our customers' routine and more specialized needs and serve as a scientific resource for them. Envigo frequently assists customers in solving problems related to animal husbandry, health and genetics, biosecurity, regulatory strategy, and other areas.
Competition
Competition in Envigo's market segments includes:


● | in-house R&D divisions of biopharmaceutical companies, who maintain their own animal breeding stocks;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | research models suppliers, such as Charles River Laboratories, Taconic Biosciences and Janvier Labs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | transgenic service providers such as The Jackson Laboratory, Taconic Biosciences and Cyagen.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is competition for customers on the basis of many factors, including scientific and technological expertise, quality, reputation, responsiveness, price, scope of product and related service offerings, and geographic presence.
We believe there are significant barriers to becoming a global provider including the construction of bio-secure barrier production facilities, flexible-film isolator production facilities and the population of these facilities with over 130 strains of animal models requires years of investment and strict operating procedures.
Industry Support and Animal Welfare
Envigo is committed to delivering first-class health and genetic quality, operational performance and customer service. High standards of animal welfare are vital to each of these, and so are integral to Envigo's business success.
Envigo has been at the forefront of animal welfare improvements and the humane care of laboratory animals. Envigo is a leading advocate for implementation of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement). Members of Envigo's scientific and technical care staff undertake continuing professional development in the field of laboratory animal science, with special focus to animal welfare and the 3Rs, and they are encouraged to publish and present within the scientific community.

23



Envigo has formed an internal Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, comprising staff from many disciplines within Envigo, in addition to external representation, to comply with applicable regulations and provide strict oversight of animal welfare matters. Envigo's animal production facilities in the U.S. and the Netherlands, are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (“AAALAC”), a private, non-profit, international accrediting organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. Envigo's facilities are routinely inspected by government agencies tasked with enforcing animal welfare regulations.
Envigo is firmly committed to the 3Rs and to reducing the number of animals used in research by emphasizing health and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability. Whenever possible, Envigo uses technological advances, such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents, micro-sampling and in vitro assays.
Laboratory animals remain an essential component in the research and development that our customers conduct. They further our knowledge of living systems and help in the discovery and development of products that can save or enhance people’s lives. Envigo works with the scientific community to improve our understanding and promote best practice in the care and welfare of research animals. As providers of research models to the research community, Envigo is responsible to our customers and the public for the health and well-being of the animals in our care.
Environmental, Social and Governance Principles
Envigo endeavors to fully comply with all applicable environmental, social and governance criteria. Envigo's strengths include, among other areas, its dedicated responsibility for environmental issues; its waste management and hazardous substances handling procedures; labor and human rights policies (including employee health and safety); customer protection policies and efforts; and policies on anticorruption and bribery.
Animal Welfare. Envigo maintain policies regarding animal welfare. Given Envigo's line of business, animal welfare is one of its highest priorities, as it is crucially important from both an ethical and a good business practices perspective.
Environmental. Envigo maintains policies regarding appropriate energy use, treatment of waste, and natural resource conservation.
Social. Envigo's business practices stress ethical engagement with suppliers and customers. Envigo has implemented a Suppliers and Contractors Governance Policy. We believe that Envigo provides a crucial, socially important service: safety testing services that are mandated by governments around the world as a crucial step in the discovery and safe development of pharmaceuticals.
Governance. Envigo has adopted and implemented a Global Code of Conduct for all employees and internally promotes an anonymous, third-party whistle-blower hotline (located at envigo.com/integrity). Envigo has put in place stringent anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies and does not participate in any type of political fund raising or political action committee efforts.
Human Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2021, Envigo had approximately 1,200 employees. Envigo's workforce was distributed geographically approximately as follows: 65% in North America and 35% in the rest of the world (primarily UK and Europe).
In addition to growth opportunities, Envigo strives to attract, motivate, and retain top talent by endeavoring to provide competitive compensation levels while rewarding outcomes and behaviors that align with our performance, culture, and values. 2020 marked the first year that Envigo commenced a competitive market compensation philosophy and pay guidelines for all positions in the U.S. and completed the same approach in the U.K. at the end of first quarter of 2021. This deliberate focus elevated Envigo's competitive pay position in the life science industry overall, but more importantly in the local markets in which Envigo conducts business.
Pay equity analyses are performed in countries where they are legally required, and Envigo is embarking on embracing an internal pay equity analysis as part of internal auditing, in an effort to ensure pay fairness and selling, general and administrative oversight. Our assertive position on pay should ensure our continuing efforts to be competitive in the marketplace. Furthermore, Envigo continues to build on a global job architecture that allows for aligning pay by job role (slotting) with market rates and serves as a career path tool to encourage a culture of upward mobility and retention.

24



Correspondingly, Envigo also promotes a healthy and safe workplace for its employees. Envigo maintains a Global Policy on Environmental Safety & Health and sustainability and, as part of its efforts to promote its goal of working safely. In the second half of 2019, Envigo implemented a management system approach to complement its safety performance, which involves both employee and management engagement and ownership of its site-level environmental, health, safety, and sustainability programs globally. At every Envigo site, Envigo has dedicated site champions and empowers all employees to act and behave as safety leaders promoting employee health and safety; additionally, Envigo has programs and communications that keep site management engaged in their local health and safety programs. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, Envigo has taken actions to protect the workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. Envigo has established a global crisis management team (“ICARE”), which includes a team of internal subject matter experts who have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on employee safety and Envigo's global business operations. As Envigo navigates the pandemic and focuses on keeping people safe, Envigo continues to establish stringent safety protocols at its operating and regional corporate sites. As always, Envigo's goal is to provide a safe work environment for employees, while still meeting our customer’s needs. 
Envigo's global and site business continuity plans are comprehensive, active, and regularly updated as Envigo continues to meet requirements for supporting COVID-19 guidelines.
Envigo is also committed to cultivating a welcoming and inclusive environment. Operating in 32 facilities and in eight countries worldwide, Envigo believes in treating its employees and prospective talent with dignity, decency, and respect. Envigo recognizes that the mix of its employees contributes to a more innovative, inclusive and productive workforce and that embracing people of all backgrounds and experiences is a strength for its business. Envigo's goal is to continue to build a talented workforce reflective of the global communities in which we live and work, and it is critical that our people feel like valued members of our company.
Likewise, Envigo believes that it has begun to take positive steps to promote a sense of belonging for its employees in the workplace by building our initiatory DE & I committee (Diversity Equity and Inclusion); expanding diversity representation at our senior level management; and developing a plan to centralize diversity and inclusion resources for all employees. Additionally, this committee will be tasked with facilitating senior leadership training on cultural differences, anti-harassment and anti-discrimination, unconscious bias, and micro-inequities; and rolling out a diverse selection process in collaboration with our talent acquisition team related to hiring.
As of December 1 2021, women made up approximately 55% of Envigo's global workforce and 39% of Envigo's global leadership positions, defined as positions carrying the title of Director to Vice President.
Envigo's employees are not unionized in the U.S. However, employees at some of its European facilities are represented by works councils, which are employee representative groups and/or unions, which is consistent with local customs for our industry. Envigo collaborates with the works councils and believes it has good relationships with our employees.
Properties
Envigo owns or leases the land and buildings where Envigo has facilities to support its RMS operations, including large domestic facilities in California, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, and also in foreign countries including those in the U.K., the Netherlands, France, Spain and Israel. In addition, Envigo leases its corporate headquarters located in Indianapolis, Indiana, as well as some of its smaller operating facilities. Envigo believes its office space and facilities are suitable and adequate to support our current business needs and are appropriately utilized. Many of Envigo's leases have an option to renew, and Envigo believes that it will be able to successfully renew expiring leases on satisfactory terms.
Contractual Arrangements
Generally, Envigo's contracts are short-term in nature and based upon purchase orders submitted for specific customer requirements. Pricing is based upon Envigo's list price which is market-adjusted. In addition, with certain larger customers, Envigo has entered into long­-term supplier agreements. As part of the EGSI acquisition, Envigo entered into a five-year supplier agreement with a key strategic partner that includes minimum purchase commitments and preferred pricing (equal to best price extended to similar customers). Envigo also has a supplier agreement with another large customer that includes discounted pricing. 

25



Regulatory Matters
As Envigo's business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide, Envigo is subject to numerous, and sometimes overlapping, regulatory environments.
The Animal Welfare Act (“AWA”) governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the U.S. other than laboratory rats, mice and birds. For regulated species, the AWA and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size, shipping conditions, sanitation and environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals. Separately, facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the U.S. Public Health Service (“PHS”) must also adhere to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and follow the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals produced by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research.
Envigo is subject to licensing and registration requirement standards set by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and similar agencies in other countries for the care and use of regulated species. Envigo's operations in the Europe follow the standards as stipulated by the Directive 2010/63/EU on the Protection of Animals Used for Scientific Purposes. Stipulations within that Directive were transposed into national legislations within the EU (including the U.K.) in 2013. Envigo is regularly consulted and inspected by the relevant national authorities in order to ensure continued compliance with the legal requirements in each nation in which it operates.
Envigo's import and export of animals and its operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions, as well as a variety of national, regional, and local laws and regulations, which establish the standards for the humane treatment, care, handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities.
In addition, the specific activities of some of Envigo's businesses require Envigo to hold specialized licenses for the conduct, manufacture, and distribution of particular products and services.
All of Envigo's sites are subject to licensing and regulation under international treaties and conventions, including national, regional and local laws relating to:

●the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens;

● | the handling, use, storage and disposal of chemicals (including narcotics and psychotropic drugs), biological reagents, laboratory specimens, hazardous waste and radioactive materials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities; and protection of the environment and general public.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To assure these compliance obligations, Envigo has established quality assurance procedures and functions. The quality assurance function operates independently from those individuals that manage RMS production.
​
Intellectual Property
​
Envigo maintains and protects trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information regarding many of its business processes and related systems. Although Envigo's intellectual property rights are valuable to its success, Envigo believes that such factors as the technical expertise, proprietary know-how, ability and experience of its staff are more important. Where Envigo consider it appropriate, steps are taken to protect its know-how through confidentiality agreements and registration of title or use. While Envigo has certain trademarks and patents, Envigo has no patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of its services are dependent.
COVID-19
The outbreak of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization declared in March 2020 to be a pandemic, continues to spread throughout the United States of America and the globe. Many U.S. State Governors issued temporary Executive Orders that, among other stipulations, effectively prohibited in-person work activities for many industries and businesses, having the effect of suspending or severely curtailing operations. The outbreak continued through the Summer 2020 and, after abating somewhat, had a precipitous resurgence in the Fall and Early Winter 2020/2021. During December 2020, upon completion of clinical trials, COVID-19 vaccines received approval from health governing bodies in the U.S. and Europe and a phased inoculation of populations was begun. New variants of the 

26



COVID-19 virus continue to emerge and one or more may prove able to partially or fully avoid the protective effect of these vaccines and could prove disruptive in the future.
Due to the world-wide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations have been impacted in many ways including:


● | Disruption in the supply of certain animal research models, including a disruption in the supply of non-human primates (“NHPs”) from China. There is no certainty as to when or if the supply of non-human primates from China will restart;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●Temporary cancelation or delay in customer orders; and
●Product demand fluctuations; and
●Increased supply chain cost and decreased availability
Envigo has been able to secure NHPs from other sources in Asia to cover a large portion of NHPs typically sourced from China, but customer demand continues to outpace supply.
