Item 1. Business
Overview

We are a leader in RNA-targeted therapy and believe our medicines are pioneering new markets, changing standards of care and transforming the lives of people with devastating diseases. Our clinical pipeline of potential first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines address a broad range of diseases. We are primarily focused on two core franchises: neurology and cardiometabolic. Our commercial products SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, are approved in major markets around the world. Within our late-stage pipeline, we have six Phase 3 studies underway with five medicines: tofersen for SOD1-ALS, tominersen for Huntington’s disease, IONIS-TTR-LRx for transthyretin, or TTR, amyloidosis, IONIS-APOCIII-LRx for familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, and pelacarsen for lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), driven cardiovascular disease.

2020 was a transformational year for Ionis. With new leadership and a new strategy to commercialize medicines from our wholly owned pipeline, we took important steps towards our goal of becoming one of the most successful biotechnology companies. We invested in our commercial capabilities and expanded our wholly owned pipeline, accelerated by the acquisition of Akcea Therapeutics, or the Akcea Acquisition. As one company, we believe we are stronger and more efficient, with enhanced ability to achieve even greater future success. We initiated two Phase 3 studies and reported clinical proof-of-concept results from six medicines. We also advanced our mid-stage pipeline by initiating more than ten Phase 2 studies, including four studies with our wholly owned medicines. In 2020, we also broadened the scope of our technology by demonstrating we could safely and effectively deliver an antisense medicine to the lungs. We accomplished all this and achieved our 2020 financial guidance, with revenues of $729.3 million and a year-end cash balance of $1.9 billion, even in the challenging COVID-19 pandemic environment.

 Our multiple sources of revenue provide us with substantial financial strength. Our financial strength enables us to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which is focused on internal investment in three key areas: our wholly owned pipeline, building our commercial capabilities and broadening the reach of our technology. We believe investing in these areas moves us closer to our goal of 12 or more marketed products in 2026 and will drive the greatest value for patients and shareholders.

Commercial Medicines

SPINRAZA is the global foundation-of-care for the treatment of patients of all ages with spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, a progressive, debilitating and often fatal genetic disease. Biogen, our partner responsible for commercializing SPINRAZA worldwide, reported that as of December 31, 2020, over 11,000 patients were on SPINRAZA therapy in markets around the world. SPINRAZA is approved in over 50 countries with formal reimbursement in over 40 countries. From inception through December 31, 2020, we have earned $1.3 billion in revenues from our SPINRAZA collaboration, including more than $930 million in royalties on sales of SPINRAZA.

TEGSEDI is a once weekly, self-administered subcutaneous medicine approved in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil for the treatment of patients with polyneuropathy caused by hereditary TTR amyloidosis, or hATTR, a debilitating, progressive, and fatal disease. As of December 31, 2020, TEGSEDI was commercially available in 15 countries. In 2021, we began selling TEGSEDI in Europe through a distribution model with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi. In Latin America, PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC, through its exclusive license agreement with us, is commercializing TEGSEDI in Brazil and is working towards access in additional Latin American countries.

WAYLIVRA is a once weekly, self-administered, subcutaneous medicine that received conditional marketing authorization in May 2019 from the European Commission, or EC, as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis. We launched WAYLIVRA in the EU in the third quarter of 2019. In 2021, we began selling WAYLIVRA through a distributor, Sobi. Through our exclusive license agreement with PTC, we are working to expand access to WAYLIVRA across Latin America, beginning in Brazil. In the second quarter of 2020, PTC submitted the WAYLIVRA marketing application for approval in Brazil to the National Health Surveillance Agency (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária), or ANVISA.

COVID-19

As a company focused on improving the health of people around the world, our priority during the COVID-19 pandemic is the safety of our employees, their families, the healthcare workers who work with us and the patients who rely on our medicines. We are also focused on maintaining the quality of our studies and minimizing the impact to timelines. While the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted some areas of our business, we believe our mitigation efforts and financial strength will enable us to continue to manage through the pandemic and execute on our strategic initiatives. Because the situation is extremely fluid, we are continuing to evaluate the impact COVID-19 could have on our business, including the impact on our commercial products and the medicines in our pipeline.

Our Marketed Medicines – Transformational Medicines Bringing Value to Patients Today

SPINRAZA – SPINRAZA (nusinersen) injection for intrathecal use is a survival motor neuron-2, or SMN2, directed antisense medicine indicated for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients.

SPINRAZA continues to demonstrate substantial benefit in SMA patients of all ages, supporting its position as a global foundation of care for the treatment of SMA. Biogen, our worldwide commercial partner, reported that as of December 31, 2020, there were more than 11,000 patients on SPINRAZA therapy with approval in over 50 countries around the world.

SMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, if untreated, individuals with the most severe type of SMA, infantile-onset, or Type 1, SMA, can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing. Due to a loss of, or defect in, the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough SMN protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein a patient can produce on his/her own. Patients with Type 1 SMA produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond two years without respiratory support. Patients with later-onset, or Type 2 or Type 3 SMA, suffer from less severe, but still life-altering, forms of SMA. These patients produce greater amounts of SMN protein, but also experience progressive degeneration due to the disease.

The approval of SPINRAZA was based on safety and efficacy data from multiple clinical studies, including two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, ENDEAR, in patients with infantile-onset SMA, and CHERISH, in patients with later-onset SMA as well as from SHINE, an ongoing open label extension, or OLE, study for patients with SMA who participated in prior SPINRAZA studies.

Biogen is conducting DEVOTE, a Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and potential to achieve increased efficacy with a higher dose of SPINRAZA compared to the currently approved dose. The DEVOTE study is enrolling SMA patients of all ages, including adults. We and Biogen believe that SPINRAZA’s favorable long-term safety and tolerability profile observed in over 11,000 SMA patients of all ages, with some patients treated for up to 7 years, supports evaluation of higher SPINRAZA dosing.

In January 2021, Biogen initiated the global Phase 4 RESPOND study evaluating the benefit of SPINRAZA in infants and children with a suboptimal clinical response to the gene therapy, onasemnogene abeparvovec. RESPOND is a two-year, open-label study that Biogen is conducting at approximately 20 sites worldwide and is expecting to enroll approximately 60 children with SMA. The primary endpoint is the total score on the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination.

 
For over six years, Biogen has been conducting the Phase 2 open-label NURTURE study, the first study investigating a treatment targeting the underlying cause of SMA in infants with the genetic diagnosis of SMA (most likely to develop SMA Type 1 or 2) before onset of symptoms. Biogen published an interim analysis of the NURTURE data demonstrating SPINRAZA-treated infants achieved motor milestones in timelines more consistent with normal development than what is observed in the natural history of patients with Type 1 SMA. At the time of the interim analysis, all patients were alive and did not require respiratory intervention. All of the patients in the study were able to sit without support and 96 percent of the patients were able to walk either with assistance or independently. No new safety concerns were identified.

In November 2018, SPINRAZA was recognized with the International Prix Galien Best Biotechnology Product award. The prestigious honor marks the seventh Prix Galien award for SPINRAZA, following country recognitions in the U.S., Germany, Italy, Belgium-Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the U.K. The International Prix Galien award is given every two years by Prix Galien International Committee members in recognition of excellence in scientific innovation to improve human health.

TEGSEDI – TEGSEDI (inotersen) injection is an RNA-targeted medicine indicated for the treatment of polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults. TEGSEDI is commercially available in 15 countries, including the U.S., many European countries, Canada and Latin America.

TTR amyloidosis is a systemic, progressive and fatal disease caused by the formation and aggregation of TTR amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs, including peripheral nerves, heart, intestinal track, and central nervous system. There are an estimated 250,000 people worldwide with TTR amyloidosis.

TTR amyloidosis that is the result of inherited mutations in the TTR gene is referred to as hATTR. There are an estimated 50,000 people worldwide with hATTR. There are two primary manifestations of hATTR: polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Many people with hATTR often experience both manifestations, but often one manifestation or the other is diagnosed first and is more pronounced.

In people with hATTR, both the mutant and wild type, or wt, TTR protein builds up as fibrils in tissues, such as peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal system, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The presence of TTR protein fibrils interferes with the normal function of these tissues. As the TTR protein fibrils enlarge, more tissue damage occurs and the disease worsens, resulting in poor quality of life and eventually death. We designed TEGSEDI to reduce the production of the TTR protein, the underlying cause of hATTR.

People without mutations in the TTR gene can also develop ATTR, often referred to as wild-type, or wt-ATTR. This non-hereditary form of the disease results from normal, non-mutant, TTR protein forming fibrils, primarily in the heart. People with hATTR cardiomyopathy and wt-ATTR experience ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure, which results in death within three to five years from disease onset. It is estimated that more than 200,000 people worldwide have wt-ATTR.

TEGSEDI was recognized with the Prix Galien USA award for the Best Biotechnology Product in 2020. TEGSEDI is the second of our products to receive this prestigious honor.

The approvals of TEGSEDI were based on results from the Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with stage 1 and stage 2 polyneuropathy. Results from that study demonstrated that patients treated with TEGSEDI experienced significant benefit compared to patients treated with placebo across both co-primary endpoints: the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy, or Norfolk QoL-DN, and modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7, or mNIS+7, a measure of neuropathic disease progression. In July 2018, the final results from the NEURO-TTR pivotal study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

We also conducted an OLE study in patients with hATTR treated with TEGSEDI. This study was intended to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety profile of TEGSEDI. We reported interim data from the study that demonstrated continued efficacy in patients after two years and there were no new safety signals identified. Results also showed that patients who started treatment earlier achieved greater long-term disease stabilization compared to those who switched from placebo to TEGSEDI in the OLE study. The data from this study were published in The European Journal of Neurology in May 2020.
WAYLIVRA – WAYLIVRA (volanesorsen) is an antisense medicine indicated as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.

WAYLIVRA is commercially available in six European countries. We plan to launch WAYLIVRA in Brazil through our exclusive license agreement with PTC, assuming approval.

 
FCS is a rare, genetic disease characterized by extremely elevated triglyceride levels that is estimated to affect 3,000 to 5,000 people worldwide. FCS can lead to many chronic health issues including severe, recurrent abdominal pain, fatigue, high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis and abnormal enlargement of the liver or spleen. In addition, people with FCS are often unable to work, adding to their disease burden. In severe cases, patients can have bleeding into the pancreas, serious tissue damage, infection and cyst formation, as well as damage to other vital organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys.

WAYLIVRA reduces triglyceride levels by inhibiting the production of apolipoprotein C-III, or apoC-III, a protein that is a key regulator of triglyceride levels. People who have low levels of apoC-III or reduced apoC-III function have lower levels of triglycerides and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease, or CVD. By inhibiting the production of apoC-III, WAYLIVRA is able to reduce triglyceride levels in people with high levels of triglycerides.

The conditional marketing authorization for WAYLIVRA is based on results from the Phase 3 APPROACH study, the ongoing APPROACH OLE study and supported by results from the Phase 3 COMPASS study. The pivotal APPROACH study was a one-year, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 66 patients with FCS (average baseline triglycerides of 2,209 mg/dL, or 25.0 mmol/L). The study achieved its primary endpoint of reduction in triglycerides at three months, with a 77 percent mean reduction in triglycerides, which translated into a 1,712 mg/dL (19.3 mmol/L) mean absolute triglyceride reduction in WAYLIVRA-treated patients. We observed 50 percent of treated patients achieved triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL, a commonly accepted threshold for pancreatitis risk. In addition, treatment with WAYLIVRA was associated with a statistically significant reduced rate of pancreatitis attacks in the group of patients who had the highest incidence of pre-study pancreatitis and reduced abdominal pain in patients reporting pain before treatment in the study. In August 2019, the final results from the APPROACH pivotal study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

An OLE study is ongoing for patients with FCS who have completed or meet the study criteria for the APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Additionally, we have expanded access programs, or EAPs, for WAYLIVRA.
Drug Discovery and Development

Introduction to Drug Discovery
 
Proteins are essential working molecules in a cell. Almost all human diseases result from inappropriate protein production, improper protein activity or loss of a protein. Antisense medicines can modify the production of proteins by targeting RNAs. In this way, antisense medicines can inhibit the production of a disease-causing protein, modify the protein produced or increase the production of a protein that, when absent, causes diseases. Antisense medicines can also treat diseases by targeting and reducing RNAs that may be causing diseases (so called “toxic RNAs”). RNAs are naturally occurring molecules in the body that primarily act as messengers that carry the information the cell needs to produce proteins from the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, to the protein making complex in the cell. When antisense medicines bind to the specific RNAs of a particular gene, they will ultimately alter the production of the protein encoded in the target gene or, in the case of disease-causing RNAs, degrade the toxic RNAs.
Our Development Projects
 
We are a leader in the discovery and development of antisense oligonucleotide medicines, or antisense medicines. By efficiently screening many targets in parallel to select the best candidates and applying our rational approach to selecting disease targets, we have built a robust portfolio of medicines designed to treat many serious diseases, such as cardiometabolic diseases, neurological diseases and others. We are developing antisense medicines for systemic and local delivery (e.g., subcutaneous, intrathecal, intraocular, oral and aerosol).

We plan to continue to add new investigational medicines to our pipeline creating opportunities to continue to generate substantial revenue. We also continue to improve our scientific understanding of our medicines, including how our medicines impact the biological processes of the diseases we target.

With our expertise in discovering and characterizing novel antisense medicines, our scientists can optimize the properties of our antisense medicines against each particular target. Our scientists have made significant advances in chemical modifications we use in our antisense medicines, such as with our Generation 2+ antisense medicines, which have increased potency and an improved side effect profile over our earlier generation medicines. Our scientists have further improved upon our second-generation chemistry with our Generation 2.5 chemistry, an advancement that further increases the potency of our medicines, which broadens the organs and tissues in which our medicines can work. We currently have 17 Generation 2.5 medicines in development, and we anticipate that more of our future medicines will incorporate our Generation 2.5 chemistry.

In addition to improving the chemical foundation of our medicines, we have also created LIgand-Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which we design to enhance the effective uptake and activity of our medicines in particular tissues. With our LICA technology we attach specific chemical structures or molecules to our antisense medicines. With our first LICA conjugate, a complex sugar-like molecule called N-acetylgalactosamine, or GalNac, we have shown an increase in medicinal potency of 20-30-fold for liver targets, compared to non-conjugated antisense medicines. We currently have 15 LICA medicines in development, including three LICA medicines currently in Phase 3 studies, pelacarsen, for CVD, IONIS-TTR-LRx, for all forms of ATTR and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx for FCS. We also have four investigational medicines that combine our Generation 2.5 chemistry and LICA technology.
 
 
We have utilized our chemistry advancements, such as Generation 2.5 and LICA, to expand the therapeutic and commercial opportunities of our pipeline. These advancements, along with the manufacturing and analytical processes that are the same across our medicines, shorten our timeline from initial concept to the first human dose, when compared to early development timelines for other drug modalities like small molecule and antibody medicines.

1. CVDRR: Cardiovascular disease risk reduction. 2. TG: Triglyceride. 3. sHTG: Severe hypertriglyceridemia.

The above table lists the medicines in our clinical pipeline. We categorize patient studies to establish a medicine’s safety profile as Phase 1/2 and those studies in healthy volunteers as Phase 1. The table includes the disease indication, a partner (if the medicine is partnered), and the development status of each medicine. We have included descriptions for each of our medicines in Phase 2 and Phase 3 development below.
  
We are focused on pioneering new markets and changing standards of care creating a deep and broad pipeline of over 30 potentially first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines in clinical trials. We believe we have the potential to deliver significant value to patients affected by the devastating diseases each medicine addresses, many of which have limited or no treatment options.

Our Phase 3 Medicines

As of February 2020, we have five medicines in six Phase 3 studies: tofersen, tominersen, IONIS-TTR-LRx, IONIS-APOCIII-LRx, and pelacarsen.

Tofersen (IONIS-SOD1Rx or BIIB067) – Tofersen is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, which is a well understood genetic cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. SOD1-ALS is a rare, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the SOD1 gene leading to a progressive loss of motor neurons. As a result, people with SOD1-ALS experience increasing muscle weakness, loss of movement, difficulty breathing and swallowing and eventually succumb to the disease. Current treatment options for people with SOD1-ALS are extremely limited, with no medicines that significantly slow disease progression.

Our partner, Biogen, conducted a Phase 1/2 study that demonstrated proof of biology and proof of concept. At the highest dose tested, treatment with tofersen over a three month period resulted in a statistically significant lowering of SOD1 protein levels in the CSF and positive numerical trends across three efficacy endpoints: slowing of clinical decline as measured by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised, or ALSFRS-R, slowing of decline in respiratory function as measured by vital capacity and slowing of decline in muscle strength as measured by a handheld device, all compared to placebo. The efficacy, safety and tolerability profile in this study supported the continued development of tofersen in ALS.

In December 2020, Biogen completed enrollment in the VALOR Phase 3 clinical study of tofersen. In the VALOR study Biogen is assessing the efficacy and safety of tofersen versus placebo in approximately 100 patients with SOD1-ALS. The primary endpoint of this study is an analysis based on the ALSFRS-R, which is a validated rating instrument that monitors the progression of disability in patients with ALS.

In December 2018, Biogen exercised its option to license tofersen based on the positive interim analysis from the Phase 1/2 study. As a result, Biogen is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for tofersen.

Tominersen (IONIS-HTTRx or RG6042) – Tominersen is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to target the underlying cause of Huntington’s disease, or HD, by reducing the production of the toxic mutant huntingtin protein, or mHTT. HD is a rare, inherited, genetic brain disorder that results in the progressive deterioration of mental abilities and physical control. In the U.S. and major European markets there are approximately 80,000 individuals with symptomatic HD and more than five-fold this number with presymptomatic HD. HD is one of several genetic diseases in which the body mistakenly repeats certain DNA sequences, often referred to as triplet repeat disorders. The resulting mHTT protein is toxic and gradually damages neurons in the brain. Symptoms of HD usually appear between the ages of 30 to 50 years and continually worsen over a 10 to 25-year period. Ultimately, the weakened individual succumbs to pneumonia, heart failure or other complications. Presently, there are no disease-modifying treatments available for HD patients, with current medicines only managing some disease symptoms.

 
We completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study of tominersen in patients with early stage HD. In this study, we observed dose-dependent reductions of mHTT among patients treated with tominersen. Tominersen also demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this Phase 1/2 clinical study. In March 2018, we reported data from the study that demonstrated substantial reductions in the mHTT as observed in the cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF. The reductions in mHTT were in the target range that produced disease reversal in preclinical models of HD. Tominersen was the first medicine to demonstrate disease-modifying potential by lowering the root cause of HD, the mHTT protein. There were no serious adverse events reported and no participants discontinued from the study. The data from this study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2019.

Following the results from the Phase 1/2 study, Roche initiated the Phase 3 GENERATION HD1 study of tominersen and completed enrollment in April 2020. GENERATION HD1 is a randomized, multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled study in approximately 800 patients with HD. The GENERATION HD1 study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of bi-monthly and tri-annual dosing regimens of tominersen for 25 months of dosing. The global primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the composite Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale, or cUHDRS, and the U.S. primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the Total Functional Capacity, or TFC.

In addition to the Phase 3 study, all participants who took part in the Phase 1/2 study continued to receive tominersen as part of an OLE study to assess the safety and tolerability of tominersen. In parallel with the OLE, Roche initiated a natural history study in a similar patient population to the OLE. The natural history study is planned as a 15-month study aimed at further understanding the role of mHTT in disease progression and includes approximately 100 participants. There is no drug treatment in the natural history study, as the goal is to understand the natural progression of HD.

The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted PRIority MEdicines scheme, or PRIME, designation to tominersen. EMA PRIME status is granted to medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. The FDA and EMA granted Orphan Medicine Designation for tominersen to treat people with HD.

We entered into a collaboration with Roche to develop and commercialize antisense medicines to treat HD in April 2013. In December 2017, Roche exercised its option to license tominersen. As a result, Roche is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for tominersen.

IONIS-TTR-LRx – IONIS-TTR-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of transthyretin, the same protein inhibited by TEGSEDI (inotersen). There are two types of ATTR amyloidosis: hATTR amyloidosis and wt-ATTR amyloidosis. We are developing IONIS-TTR-LRx as a monthly self-administered subcutaneous injection for the treatment of people with all forms of TTR amyloidosis. See the TEGSEDI summary under “Our Marketed Medicines” section for more information about hATTR amyloidosis and wt-ATTR amyloidosis.

In September 2019, we reported results from the Phase 1 study with IONIS-TTR-LRx in healthy volunteers at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual Meeting. In this study, subjects treated with IONIS-TTR-LRx achieved dose-dependent reductions of TTR protein of up to 94 percent and IONIS-TTR-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile, consistent with our other liver LICA medicines.

The first of two indications we are pursuing is for the treatment of patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. We initiated the global NEURO-TTRansform Phase 3 study for IONIS-TTR-LRx in November 2019. NEURO-TTRansform is a multi-center, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IONIS-TTR-LRx in up to 140 patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR amyloidosis. The current study will be compared to the historical placebo arm from the TEGSEDI (inotersen) NEURO-TTR Phase 3 study that we completed in 2017. The NEURO-TTRansform study includes multiple primary endpoints, including the percent change from baseline in serum TTR concentration, modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7), and in the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN).

The second indication we are pursuing is for the treatment of patients with cardiomyopathy caused by hereditary or wild-type TTR amyloidosis. In January 2020, we initiated the global CARDIO-TTRansform Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study. CARDIO-TTRansform is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in up to 750 patients with cardiomyopathy caused by hereditary or wt-TTR amyloidosis. The CARDIO-TTRansform study includes co-primary outcome measures of cardiovascular death and frequency of cardiovascular clinical events.

IONIS-APOCIII-LRx – IONIS-APOCIII-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of apoC-III for patients who are at risk of disease due to elevated triglyceride levels. ApoC-III is a protein produced in the liver that regulates triglyceride metabolism in the blood. People with severely elevated triglycerides, such as people with FCS, are at high risk for acute pancreatitis and an increased risk of CVD. ApoC-III is also the target of WAYLIVRA (volanesorsen), the only medicine approved for the treatment of people with FCS. See the WAYLIVRA summary under “Our Marketed Medicines” section for more information about FCS.
  
We initiated a Phase 3 study in December 2020 in patients with FCS based on the Phase 2 data described below. We believe that the enhancements offered by our LICA technology can provide greater reductions in triglycerides, significantly lower doses and less frequent administration, compared to WAYLIVRA.

In January 2020, we reported positive results from a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and at high risk of or with established CVD. Patients were treated with multiple doses of IONIS-APOCIII-LRx administered weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. IONIS-APOCIII-LRx achieved statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in fasting triglycerides compared to placebo at all dose levels. Additionally, at the highest monthly dose, 91 percent of patients achieved serum triglycerides of ≤ 150 mg/dL, the recognized threshold for cardiovascular risk, compared to less than 5 percent of patients in the placebo group. IONIS-APOCIII-LRx also achieved statistical significance in numerous key secondary endpoints, including significant reductions in apoC-III, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or VLDL-C, and remnant cholesterol, and a statistically significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL-C. IONIS-APOCIII-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the study.

Pelacarsen (IONIS-APO(a)-LRx or TQJ230) – Pelacarsen is an investigational LICA antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of apolipoprotein(a), or Apo(a), in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). Elevated Lp(a) is recognized as an independent, genetic cause of CVD. Lp(a) levels are determined at birth and lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise, do not impact Lp(a) levels. It is estimated that there are more than eight million people living with CVD and elevated levels of Lp(a). Inhibiting the production of Apo(a) in the liver reduces the level of Lp(a) in blood, potentially slowing down or reversing cardiovascular disease in people with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), a condition in which individuals have levels of Lp(a) greater than 50 mg/dL, the recognized threshold for risk of CVD.

We believe antisense technology is well suited to address hyperlipoproteinemia(a) because antisense technology specifically targets the RNA that codes for all forms of the Apo(a) molecule. Furthermore, we believe addressing elevated Lp(a) is the next important horizon in CVD risk reduction.

In December 2019, Novartis initiated the Phase 3 Lp(a)HORIZON study of pelacarsen, a global, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled outcomes study in approximately 7,500 patients with elevated Lp(a) levels and a prior cardiovascular event, based on the Phase 2 data described below. Patients will be treated with 80 mg of pelacarsen administered monthly by subcutaneous injection. The primary endpoint in Lp(a)HORIZON is the time to occurrence of first major adverse cardiovascular event, or MACE.

We reported results of the Phase 2 study with pelacarsen in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a) at the American Heart Association, or AHA, annual meeting in November 2018. In this clinical study, we observed statistically significant and dose dependent reductions from baseline in Lp(a) levels. Approximately 98 percent of patients who received the highest dose in the study demonstrated a reduction in Lp(a) levels to below 50 mg/dL. This study of pelacarsen was the longest and largest clinical study in patients with established CVD and elevated levels of Lp(a). At the time, this study was also the longest and largest clinical study of any of our LICA medicines. Pelacarsen demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the study. Compliance in the treatment arm of the study was almost 90 percent, which was higher than what we observed in the placebo group.

We initiated a collaboration with Novartis in January 2017 to advance pelacarsen. In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license pelacarsen. As a result, Novartis is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for pelacarsen.

Neurological Disease Medicines in Development

We are discovering and developing antisense medicines to treat people with neurological diseases. Our neurological medicines address a broad range of diseases in major regions of the brain and all central nervous system, or CNS, cell types. Our antisense medicines aim to address both large and rare patient populations. We are currently investigating potential disease-modifying treatments for common neurological diseases including, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. We also have multiple investigational medicines in clinical trials for rare neurological diseases, including ALS and hATTR polyneuropathy. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, or NINDS, at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, a third of the 7,000 known rare diseases are neurological disorders or thought to include a neurological component.

IONIS-C9Rx (BIIB078) – IONIS-C9Rx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to selectively inhibit the production of the mutated chromosome 9 open reading frame 72, or C9ORF72, gene. A mutation in this gene results in an inherited form of ALS, referred to as C9ORF72-ALS, or C9-ALS, the most prevalent genetic cause of ALS worldwide. This mutation can lead to rapid progressive loss of motor neurons and is a fatal disease characterized by muscle weakness, loss of movement, and difficulty breathing and swallowing.

We and Biogen are collaborating to develop IONIS-C9Rx to treat patients with this genetic form of ALS. In August 2018, Biogen initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating IONIS-C9Rx in adult patients with C9ORF72-ALS. The current study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of IONIS-C9Rx administered intrathecally. IONIS-C9Rx is the second medicine from our Biogen collaboration targeting a genetic form of ALS. The first is tofersen, our medicine we designed to treat SOD1 related ALS, caused by a mutation in the SOD1 gene.

IONIS-MAPTRx (BIIB080) – IONIS-MAPTRx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to selectively inhibit production of the microtubule-associated protein tau, or tau, protein in the brain. We are collaborating with Biogen to develop IONIS-MAPTRx to treat people with Alzheimer’s disease, or AD, and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain, such as certain forms of frontotemporal degeneration, or FTD, and progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP.

The tau protein is a contributor or cause of certain neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, characterized by the deposition of abnormal tau protein in neurons in the brain. AD and FTD are characterized predominantly by memory impairment and behavioral changes, resulting in a person’s inability to independently perform daily activities. PSP is characterized by problems with walking and control of movement, sleep disorder and loss of memory and ability to reason. AD generally occurs late in life and may progress to death in five to 20 years after the onset of the disease. FTD and PSP have a more rapid disease progression. In the U.S., there are approximately five million people living with AD, approximately 55,000 people living with FTD and approximately 20,000 people living with PSP.

We and Biogen completed a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1/2 study of IONIS-MAPTRx to evaluate the safety and activity of once-monthly intrathecal injections of IONIS-MAPTRx in patients with mild AD. In February 2021, Biogen reported data from this Phase 1/2 study that IONIS-MAPTRx was generally well tolerated and demonstrated dose and time-dependent target reductions. Biogen plans to advance IONIS-MAPTRx into a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.

In December 2019, Biogen exercised its option to license IONIS-MAPTRx. We are responsible for completing the Phase 1/2 in study patients with mild AD and a one-year long-term extension study. Biogen will have responsibility for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for IONIS-MAPTRx.
  
ION859 (BIIB094) – ION859 is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2, or LRRK2, protein as a potential therapy for Parkinson’s disease, or PD. The most common genetic mutations in PD are found in the LRRK2 protein. It is believed that increased LRRK2 protein activity could be one of the key drivers for developing PD.

PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of neurons in the motor system. Patient’s with PD can experience tremors, loss of balance and coordination, stiffness, slowing of movement, changes in speech and in some cases cognitive decline. PD is ultimately fatal. There are treatments that can relieve symptoms, but there is no disease modifying therapy.

We and Biogen are collaborating to develop ION859 to treat patients with PD. In August 2019, Biogen initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating ION859 in adult patients with PD. The current study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of ION859 administered intrathecally.

ION464 (BIIB101) – ION464 is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of the alpha-synuclein protein as a potential therapy for PD, Multiple System Atrophy, or MSA, and related synucleinopathies. Alpha-synuclein protein abnormally accumulates in the brains of PD and MSA patients and is thought to be one of the key drivers of these diseases. It is believed that decreasing the production of the alpha-synuclein protein will reduce the toxic effects of gain-of-function mutations as well as the primary pathology in PD and MSA patients without alpha-synuclein mutations.

We and Biogen are collaborating to develop ION464 to treat patients with PD and MSA. In July 2020, Biogen initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating ION464 in patients with MSA. The current study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ION464 administered intrathecally.

ION541 (BIIB105) – ION541 is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to selectively inhibit the production of the ataxin-2, or ATXN2, protein. In approximately 90% of the ALS population, aggregates of the TDP-43 protein induce toxicity in motor neurons. ATXN2 has been shown to modulate TDP-43 toxicity and it is believed that reduction of ATXN2 will decrease the TDP-43 aggregates and reverse or prevent disease progression, providing therapeutic benefit to most ALS patients.

We and Biogen are collaborating to develop ION541 to treat patients with most forms of ALS, regardless of family history. In October 2020, Biogen initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating ION541 in this broad ALS population. The current study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of ION541 administered intrathecally. ION541 is the first medicine from our Biogen collaboration targeting all forms of ALS.

IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx (DYN101) – IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of Dynamin 2, or DNM2, protein for the treatment of centronuclear myopathy, or CNM. CNM is a group of rare, potentially fatal disorders of the skeletal muscle cells. It is characterized by muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone and muscle atrophy, ranging from severe to mild, and potentially life-threatening.

DNM2 reduction demonstrated improved muscle mass and muscle force, and extended lifespan in animal models of the most severe form of CNM.

We and Dynacure are collaborating to develop IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx to treat patients with CNM. In November 2019, Dynacure initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx in patients with CNM. The current study is an open-label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx administered intravenously.

Cardiometabolic Disease Medicines in Development

Developing medicines targeting CVD and metabolic disorders are important areas of focus for us. According to the World Health Organization, or WHO, CVD remains the number one cause of death globally. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVD in 2016, representing approximately 30 percent of all deaths globally. Our cardiovascular medicines target the major risk factors of cardiovascular disease, including cholesterol, triglycerides and hypertension. Metabolic disorders, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, are chronic diseases that affect tens of millions of people. There is a significant need for new therapies for these people. According to the American Liver Foundation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, is the most common chronic liver condition in the U.S. It is estimated that about 25 percent of adults in the U.S. have NAFLD. Of those with NAFLD, about 20 percent have NASH or about 5% of adults in the U.S.

IONIS-TTR-LRx – See the medicine description under “Our Phase 3 Medicines” section above.

IONIS-APOCIII-LRx – See the medicine description under “Our Phase 3 Medicines” section above.

IONIS-AGT-LRx – IONIS-AGT-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of angiotensinogen to decrease blood pressure in people with treatment resistant hypertension, or TRH. Despite the availability of antihypertensive agents, TRH is still a major contributor to cardiovascular and renal disease.

Approximately 140 million adults globally and approximately 10 million adults in the U.S. have resistant hypertension, defined as failure to achieve a blood pressure goal of 140/90 (systolic/diastolic) despite the use of three or more antihypertensive medications. People with TRH have been found to have a three-fold higher chance of having fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events relative to those with controlled hypertension.

We evaluated IONIS-AGT-LRx in two Phase 2 studies. The first study was in people with mild hypertension and the second was in people with TRH who were currently on two or three antihypertensive medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Each study was randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled and designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IONIS-AGT-LRx.

In January 2021, we initiated the Phase 2b clinical study of IONIS-AGT-LRx, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in approximately 150 patients with TRH or uncontrolled hypertension who are currently on three or more antihypertensive medications, including ACE inhibitors or ARBs. The study is designed to evaluate multiple weekly doses administered subcutaneously. The primary endpoint is the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline. The study will also assess numerous secondary endpoints, and safety and tolerability of IONIS-AGT-LRx.

IONIS-GHR-LRx – IONIS-GHR-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of the growth hormone receptor, or GHr, to decrease the circulating level of insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1. IGF-1 is a hormone primarily produced in the liver that plays an important role in childhood growth. Several different diseases result from abnormally low or high levels of IGF-1, or an inappropriate response to this hormone. Elevated levels of IGF-1 results in acromegaly, a chronic, slowly progressing and potentially fatal disease. Because IGF-1 mediates the majority of the growth-promoting action of GH, reducing GHr production could in turn decrease levels of IGF-1 and provide a potential treatment for patients with acromegaly.

High levels of circulating GH and IGF-1 lead to multiple diseases characterized by organ overgrowth and physical disfigurement, such as enlarged hands, feet, and facial features. Patients with acromegaly also experience multiple chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory complications, as well as premature death. Current treatments to block IGF-1 are often unsuccessful. Drug treatments to normalize IGF-1 levels are also available but are associated with potentially serious side effects.

We completed a Phase 1, blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of IONIS-GHR-LRx in healthy volunteers. In this study, IONIS-GHR-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

 
In November 2018, we initiated the Phase 2 proof of concept clinical study of IONIS-GHR-LRx in patients with acromegaly. The study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in acromegaly patients uncontrolled on select long-acting somatostatin receptor ligands.

In January 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 open label study evaluating IONIS-GHR-LRx as a monotherapy in patients with acromegaly. The open label study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of IONIS-GHR-LRx of multiple doses administered monthly subcutaneously.

Pelacarsen – See the medicine description under “Our Phase 3 Medicines” section above.

Vupanorsen – Vupanorsen is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of the angiopoietin-like 3, or ANGPTL3, protein. People with elevated levels of the ANGPTL3 protein have high LDL-C and triglyceride levels. Studies show people with elevated levels of ANGPTL3 protein have an increased risk of premature heart attacks, increased arterial wall thickness and multiple metabolic disorders such as diseases resulting from increased liver fat. In contrast, people with lower levels of ANGPTL3 have lower LDL-C and triglyceride levels, and thus lower risk of heart attacks, lower prevalence of fatty liver and lower incidence of metabolic disorders.

In preclinical studies, treatment with an antisense medicine designed to inhibit the production of the ANGPTL3 protein in the liver resulted in lower liver fat accumulation and lower blood levels of LDL-C, triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or VLDL-C.

Results from a Phase 1/2 study of vupanorsen in healthy volunteers with elevated triglycerides were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In the study, we observed that the people with elevated triglycerides achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions in ANGPTL3 of up to 83 percent. Treatment with vupanorsen was also associated with statistically significant mean reductions in triglycerides of up to 66 percent, in LDL-C of up to 35 percent and in total cholesterol of up to 36 percent. In this study, vupanorsen demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

In November 2020, Pfizer initiated the Phase 2b TRANSLATE-TIMI 70 clinical study of vupanorsen, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in approximately 260 patients with elevated non-HDL-C and triglycerides who are receiving a stable dose of a statin, based on the Phase 2 study described below. The study is designed to evaluate multiple doses and dose regimens versus placebo. The primary endpoint is percent change from baseline in non-HDL-C. The study will also assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of vupanorsen.

In January 2020, we reported positive results from a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with elevated levels of triglycerides, or hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. Patients were treated with multiple doses of vupanorsen administered weekly and monthly. Vupanorsen achieved statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in the study’s primary endpoint of fasting triglycerides compared to placebo at all dose levels. Vupanorsen also achieved statistical significance in multiple secondary endpoints, including dose-dependent reductions in ANGPTL3, apoC-III, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C), non-HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol compared to placebo. Vupanorsen demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the study.

In October 2019, we exclusively licensed vupanorsen to Pfizer. As a result, Pfizer is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs beyond those associated with the above Phase 2 study. We have the option prior to regulatory filing for marketing approval, to participate in certain commercialization activities in the future with Pfizer in the U.S. and certain additional markets on pre-defined terms and based on meeting pre-defined criteria.

IONIS-FXI-LRx – IONIS-FXI-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of Factor XI. Factor XI is a clotting factor produced in the liver that is important in the growth of blood clots. High levels of Factor XI increase the risk of thrombosis. Thrombosis, characterized by the formation of a blood clot inside blood vessels, can cause heart attacks and strokes. People who are deficient in Factor XI have a lower incidence of thromboembolic events with minimal increase in bleeding risk. Although currently available anticoagulants reduce the risk of thrombosis, physicians associate these anticoagulants with increased bleeding, which can be fatal. By inhibiting Factor XI production, we believe that IONIS-FXI-LRx can be used broadly as an anti-thrombotic in many different therapeutic settings for which additional safe and well tolerated anti-thrombotic medicines are needed.

In November 2016, we completed a Phase 2 blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the parent medicine, IONIS-FXIRx, in people with end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, on hemodialysis. In this Phase 2 study, patients treated with IONIS-FXIRx achieved statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in Factor XI activity. In this study, IONIS-FXIRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. There were no treatment-related major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events.

 
We conducted a Phase 1, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of IONIS-FXI-LRx in healthy volunteers. In this study, IONIS-FXI-LRx produced significant reductions in FXI activity and FXI antigen, without evidence of increased bleeding. Additionally, IONIS-FXI-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study. We and Bayer are planning to report the data from this Phase 1 study this year.

In February 2017, we licensed IONIS-FXI-LRx to Bayer. As a result, Bayer is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs.

In August 2020, Bayer initiated the Phase 2b RE-THINc clinical study of IONIS-FXI-LRx, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in approximately 290 patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. The study is designed to evaluate multiple monthly doses administered subcutaneously. The primary endpoint is incidence of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. The study will also assess numerous secondary endpoints, and safety and tolerability of IONIS-FXI-LRx.

ION449 – ION449 (IONIS-AZ4-2.5-L-Rx) is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to reduce the production of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, or PCSK9, in the liver. PCSK9 is integrally involved in the regulation of LDL-cholesterol. Genetic studies have shown that individuals with life-long reductions of LDL-C due to reduced function of PCSK9 have substantially reduced risk of CVD.

In October 2020, we reported positive results from a Phase 1 clinical study of ION449 in healthy volunteers. Participants were treated with single subcutaneous doses and ION449 demonstrated dose-dependent mean reductions in circulating plasma PCSK9 and LDL-C levels of greater than 90% and up to 70%, respectively.

In November 2020, AstraZeneca initiated the Phase 2b randomized, blinded placebo-controlled clinical study that will enroll approximately 110 patients with LDL-C levels between 70 and 190mg/dl and receiving statin therapy. The study is designed to evaluate multiple monthly subcutaneous doses versus placebo. The study will also assess safety and tolerability, and multiple secondary endpoints.

IONIS-GCGRRx – IONIS-GCGRRx is an investigational antisense medicine designed to inhibit the production of the glucagon receptor, or GCGR, to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. GCGR is a receptor for the hormone glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that opposes the action of insulin and stimulates the liver to produce glucose, particularly in type 2 diabetes. In patients with advanced diabetes, uncontrolled glucagon action can lead to significant increase in blood glucose level. In addition, reducing GCGR produces more active glucagon-like peptide, or GLP-1, a hormone that preserves pancreatic function and enhances insulin secretion.

Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the blood glucose levels are too high. Although glucose is an important source of energy for your body and is vital to your health, uncontrolled increases in glucose can lead to serious health problems, such as diabetes. Diabetes is separated into type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the more common type, the body does not respond properly to insulin and, therefore, blood glucose levels are not adequately controlled.

We and Suzhou-Ribo are collaborating to develop IONIS-GCGRRx to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. In October 2019, Suzhou-Ribo initiated a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating IONIS-GCGRRx in patients with type 2 diabetes.

IONIS-ENAC-2.5Rx – IONIS-ENAC-2.5Rx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to selectively reduce epithelial sodium channel, or ENaC, to treat people with cystic fibrosis, or CF, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. CF is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. CFTR is a chloride channel expressed in epithelial cells, including those in the lung. Targeting ENaC may enable treatment of all forms of CF regardless of CFTR mutations, unlike existing therapeutics. CF is a multisystem disease that mostly affects the lungs, clogging airways due to mucus build-up and resulting in inflammation and infection. This disease is characterized by a progressive decline in lung function with acute periods of worsened symptoms, known as pulmonary exacerbations. Despite progress with other treatments, there remains a need for additional effective treatment options.

In preclinical studies in mouse models of CF, treatment with ENaC-targeting antisense medicines specifically suppressed ENaC expression, resulting in the reduction of markers of CF mucus pathology and improved lung function. Treatment not only prevented manifestations of the disease from occurring but also reversed existing manifestations of disease in the animal model.

In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1/2 blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IONIS-ENAC-2.5Rx delivered directly to the lung via a nebulizer. The study consisted of three parts: a single ascending dose, or SAD, regimen and a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, regimen in healthy volunteers, followed by a MAD regimen in patients with CF.

In October 2020, we reported positive results from the healthy volunteer portions of the Phase 1/2 study. IONIS-ENAC-2.5Rx demonstrated a significant decrease in the expression of ENaC with a favorable safety and tolerability profile, representing proof-of-concept for pulmonary delivery of an antisense medicine directly to the lung. In November 2020, we completed enrollment in the MAD portion in patients with CF.

COPD is a progressive and chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow in the lungs and is the third leading cause of death globally. It is estimated to affect approximately 16 million people in the U.S. Targeting ENaC is believed to increase airway surface hydration and improve lung clearance.

In a preclinical mouse model of woodsmoke, treatment with an ENaC-targeting antisense medicine through aerosol delivery resulted in broad distribution in the lung and improved lung function.

In December 2020, we initiated a Phase 1/2 study in patients with COPD with chronic bronchitis. The current study is a blinded, placebo-controlled, single dose study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IONIS-ENAC-2.5Rx delivered directly to the lung via a nebulizer.

 
IONIS-PKK-LRx – IONIS-PKK-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of prekallikrein, or PKK, to treat people with hereditary angioedema, or HAE. It is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by rapid and painful attacks of inflammation in the hands, feet, limbs, face, abdomen, larynx and trachea and can be fatal if swelling occurs in the larynx. PKK plays an important role in the activation of inflammatory mediators associated with acute attacks of HAE. By inhibiting the production of PKK, IONIS-PKK-LRx could be an effective prophylactic approach to preventing or reducing the severity of HAE attacks.

In August 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating IONIS-PKK-LRx in patients with HAE. The current study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of IONIS-PKK-LRx administered subcutaneously.

Results from the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and a compassionate-use study of IONIS-PKKRx and IONIS-PKK-LRx in patients living with severe bradykinin-mediated angioedema were published in September 2020 in The New England Journal of Medicine. In the study, we observed that the medicines reduced plasma prekallikrein activity levels and showed evidence of clinical efficacy in reducing the number of breakthrough attacks per month in patients over the course of the treatment, including complete resolution in a patient with Type 1 HAE, the most common form of the disease.
 
Danvatirsen – Danvatirsen (formerly IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx) is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, or STAT3, to treat people with cancer. STAT3 is a protein involved in the translation of key factors critical for tumor cell growth and survival. STAT3 is over-active in a variety of cancers, including brain, lung, breast, bone, liver and multiple myeloma. Overactivity in STAT3 prevents cancer cell death and promotes tumor cell growth.

In October 2018, we announced data from a Phase 1/2 study of danvatirsen in combination with durvalumab in recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer. The combination treatment resulted in seven percent of patients achieving a complete tumor response and 23 percent achieving either a partial or complete tumor response. This response rate is estimated to be double that with durvalumab alone, based on previous studies in this difficult to treat patient population. Results from this study demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.

IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx – IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of transmembrane protease, serine 6, or TMPRSS6, to treat anemia and iron toxicity in people with β-thalassemia, a disease caused by mutations in the beta globin gene. TMPRSS6 is a protein produced in the liver that is important in the regulation of the body’s iron homeostasis through the control of the iron regulatory protein hepcidin. Inhibition of TMPRSS6 leads to increased production of hepcidin, which results in more effective red blood cell production in the bone marrow and reduced iron toxicity in multiple organs, including the liver as a result of improved control of iron availability.

Patients with β-thalassemia can experience severe anemia, marrow expansion, bone deformities, as well as iron toxicity. While the severity of anemia varies between patients, iron toxicity is a common complication leading to high rates of mortality as a result of iron accumulation in major organs, such as the heart and liver. The current standard of care is managing patients’ symptoms with blood transfusions, and iron chelation medicines designed to remove extra iron from blood.

β-thalassemia can be further subdivided into patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, or TDT, and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia, or NTDT, including β-thalassemia intermedia. Although transfusions are not needed to support life in patients with NTDT, the associated complications of the disease are severe and often fatal.

Results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that reducing levels of TMPRSS6 may be an effective strategy to control iron availability, reduce liver iron toxicity and increase red blood cell production under conditions of β-thalassemia. In a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, we demonstrated dose-dependent reductions of serum iron and serum transferrin saturation. Additionally, we observed an increase in serum hepcidin and predicted changes in hemoglobin. IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In December 2018, we presented positive Phase 1 data at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.

In August 2020, we initiated a Phase 2a open label study evaluating IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx in patients with NTDT β-thalassemia intermedia. The open label study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx administered monthly subcutaneously.

IONIS-HBVRx – IONIS-HBVRx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to inhibit the production of viral proteins associated with hepatitis B virus, or HBV. These include proteins associated with infection and replication, including the hepatitis B surface antigen, or HBsAg, which is present in both acute and chronic infections and is associated with a poor prognosis in people with chronic HBV infection.

HBV infection is a serious health problem that can lead to significant and potentially fatal health conditions, including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection is one of the most common persistent viral infections in the world. Currently available therapies, although effective in reducing circulating HBV in the blood, do not effectively inhibit HBV antigen production and secretion, which are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of liver cancer.

GSK reported results of the Phase 2 study with IONIS-HBVRx in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases annual meeting in November 2019. In the Phase 2 study with IONIS-HBVRx, the medicine demonstrated target engagement with dose dependent declines in HBsAg with up to 3-log reductions in HBsAg at one month, including two patients who achieved reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA below levels of detection. Additionally, IONIS-HBVRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

In August 2019, GSK exercised its option to license our HBV program following the positive Phase 2 results described above. As a result, GSK is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for the HBV program.

In August 2020, GSK launched a broad Phase 2 program and initiated the Phase 2b B-Clear clinical study of IONIS-HBVRx in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus. The Phase 2b B-Clear study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in approximately 440 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients achieving HBV surface antigen and HBV DNA less than the lower limit of quantitation. The study will also assess multiple secondary endpoints and the safety and tolerability of IONIS-HBVRx.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, GSK initiated two open label Phase 2 studies, B-Fine and B-Together, in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus. The B-Fine clinical study of IONIS-HBVRx is designed to investigate the hepatitis B virus surface antigen and assess liver biopsy samples for phenotyping. The B-Together study is designed to investigate if treatment of IONIS-HBVRx followed by pegylated interferon treatment can increase the rate of hepatitis B virus surface antigen loss in patients on stable nucleoside analogue therapy.

IONIS-AR-2.5Rx – IONIS-AR-2.5Rx is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to treat people with prostate cancer by reducing the production of all known forms of androgen receptor, or AR, including variants of the AR gene. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Prostate cancer growth, proliferation and progression are all androgen-dependent and AR function is involved in disease progression at all stages of prostate cancer. For patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, current treatments largely involve opposing the action of androgens by blocking the androgen receptor or removing circulating androgens. Resistance to current therapies is frequent and can occur through a variety of mechanisms including the activation of AR signaling in tumor cells through the amplification, overexpression and mutation of the AR gene.

An open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-AR-2.5Rx was completed in people with advanced tumors for which the androgen receptor pathway is potentially a contributing factor. The study was primarily conducted in prostate cancer patients and it showed durable responses in a number of those patients. Results from this study demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development.

In March 2017, we licensed IONIS-AR-2.5Rx to Suzhou-Ribo to develop and commercialize the medicine in China.

IONIS-FB-LRx – IONIS-FB-LRx is an investigational LICA medicine we designed to inhibit the production of complement factor B, or FB. FB is produced predominantly in the liver and circulates at high levels throughout the vascular system where it plays a pivotal role in an innate immunogenic cascade. Genetic association studies have shown that overactivity of this cascade has been associated with the development of several complement-mediated diseases, including dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, and IgA nephropathy, or IgAN.

AMD is the leading cause of central vision loss in developed countries. It is estimated that the disease will affect more than three million people in the U.S. by 2026. AMD is believed to be a systemic disease with local disease manifestation at the aging retinal macula. AMD gradually destroys vision in the center of the visual field due to progressive damage of the retina. Geographic atrophy, or GA, is an advanced form of AMD and accounts for approximately fifteen percent of all AMD.

 
IgAN is one of the most common causes of inflammation that impairs the filtering ability of kidneys and is an important cause of chronic kidney disease and renal failure. Also known as Berger’s disease, IgAN is characterized by deposits of IgA in the kidneys, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. The clinical presentation, disease progression and histologic findings are highly variable.

In May 2017, we reported data from a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in 54 healthy volunteers. Subjects treated with a single dose of IONIS-FB-LRx achieved dose-dependent reductions in plasma FB of up to 50 percent. Treatment with multiple doses of IONIS-FB-LRx during a six-week period resulted in greater reductions in circulating FB levels. In this study, IONIS-FB-LRx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

We and Roche are collaborating to develop IONIS-FB-LRx for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. In June 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in patients with geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The study is a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of IONIS-FB-LRx administered subcutaneously in adults with geographic atrophy.

In September 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 study of IONIS-FB-LRx in patients with IgA nephropathy. The current study is a single-arm, open-label study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IONIS-FB-LRx administered subcutaneously in adults with primary IgA nephropathy.

ION357 – ION357 (IONIS-RHO-2.5Rx), is an investigational antisense medicine we designed to treat patients with a genetic form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa by inhibiting the production of the rhodopsin P23H mutant protein in the eye while allowing normal protein to be expressed.

Retinitis pigmentosa, or RP, is a group of rare inherited eye disorders causing photoreceptor degeneration that leads to progressive vision loss. Photoreceptors are cells in the eye’s retina responsible for converting light into signals that are sent to the brain. Photoreceptors provide us our color and night vision. Affected patients first experience defective dark adaptation during adolescence or young adulthood, followed by loss of peripheral visual field. Patients eventually have limited residual central vision, which ultimately leads to complete blindness around the age of 60.

We and ProQR are collaborating to develop ION357 to treat patients with RP. In November 2019, ProQR initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating ION357 in patients with RP. The current study is a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of ION357 in adult patients with RP.

Phase 1 Medicines in Clinical Development

The efficiency and broad applicability of our technology enables us to develop medicines for a broad range of diseases. In 2020, we initiated six Phase 1 or Phase 1/2 studies.

 
IONIS’ Phase 1 and Preclinical Pipeline

Antisense Technology

Our antisense technology is an innovative platform for discovering first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines and represents an important advance in the way we treat disease. Antisense medicines target RNA, the intermediary that conveys genetic information from a gene to the protein synthesis machinery in the cell. By targeting RNA instead of proteins, we can use antisense technology to increase, decrease or alter the production of specific proteins. The unique properties of antisense technology provide several advantages over traditional drug discovery technologies.

These advantages include:


● | Direct intervention in the disease process at the genetic level by targeting RNA: antisense technology represents a direct route from gene to drug. The explosion in genomic information and RNA biology has led to the discovery of many new disease-causing proteins and RNAs and has created new opportunities that are uniquely accessible by antisense technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Precise specificity: we design antisense medicines to target a single RNA, which minimizes the possibility of binding to unintended targets, which can cause unwanted side effects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Good drug properties: antisense medicines distribute well throughout the body without the need for special formulations or vehicles. They also have a long half-life, in the range of weeks to months, which means patients and/or healthcare providers can dose our medicines weekly, monthly or even less frequently depending on the medicine and target tissue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to combine with other medicines: because antisense medicines do not interact with the enzymes that metabolize or break down other medicines, physicians can use our medicines in combination with other medicines.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad applications to multiple disease targets, multiple tissues and multiple mechanisms: there are virtually no “undruggable” targets with antisense technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Efficient discovery and early development: because of the efficiency of our antisense technology, our drug discovery and early development costs and success rates compare favorably to small molecule or antibody drug discovery and development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We develop antisense medicines we believe will pioneer new markets and change standards of care across a wide range of diseases, including neurological and cardiometabolic diseases.

 
Technology Overview

We use our core technology platform to discover and develop medicines that affect targets in the body at the genetic level. Genes contain the information necessary to produce proteins. A gene is made up of nucleotides containing the nucleoside bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, commonly known as A, T, G and C, which are linked together to form a two-stranded structure that resembles a twisted ladder, known as DNA. The nucleotides on one side of the ladder bind weakly to complementary nucleotides on the other strand according to specific rules; for example, A pairs with T and G pairs with C, creating the ladder’s rungs (Figure 1). Scientists call this highly specific nucleotide pairing hybridization. The sequence or order of these nucleotides establishes the cell’s recipes for making proteins. Each protein’s instructions reside in a corresponding segment of DNA known as a gene.

Figure 1: Illustration of DNA.

The instructions for making a protein are transcribed from a gene, or DNA, into a different genetic molecule called messenger RNA. This process starts with the partial uncoiling of the two complementary strands of the DNA. One strand acts as a template and information stored in the DNA template strand is copied into a complementary RNA (Figure 2) by an enzyme called RNA polymerase, or RNAP. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, are mature, fully processed RNA that code for proteins.

 
Figure 2: Transcription of information contained in a gene, or DNA, to RNA.

Ribosomes, the cell’s factories for manufacturing proteins, translate mRNA into proteins. The ribosome reads the encoded information, the mRNA’s nucleotide sequence, and in doing so, strings together amino acids to form a specific protein (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Translation of the protein-coding information contained in mRNA to protein.

We primarily use our antisense technology to interrupt the cell’s protein production process by preventing the mRNA instructions from reaching the ribosome, thus inhibiting the production of the protein. We can also design antisense medicines to increase protein production for diseases caused by the lack of a particular protein or modify the processing (or splicing) of the mRNA, which can alter the composition of the protein. The mRNA sequence of nucleotides that carries the information for protein production is called the ‘sense’ strand. Scientists call the complementary nucleotide chain that binds specifically to the sense strand the “antisense” strand. We use the information contained in mRNA to design chemical structures, that we call antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, or antisense medicines, which resemble DNA and RNA and are the complement of RNA. Our antisense medicines bind with high selectivity to the mRNA they were designed to target. Since each mRNA codes for a specific protein, we can design antisense medicines that selectively inhibit the disease-causing member of a protein family without interfering with other members of the protein family that might be necessary for normal cellular or bodily functions. This unique specificity means that antisense medicines may be less toxic than traditional medicines because we can design them to minimize the impact on unintended targets.
  
We have developed the majority of the medicines in our pipeline using our advanced screens to produce medicines with what we believe have the best possible safety and tolerability profiles. We continue to advance our antisense technology to create even more potent medicines that we can use in more tissues and against more targets. These advances allow us to expand the mechanisms through which we can use our medicines and provide us with greater opportunities to use our antisense medicines to treat a greater number of diseases and reach more patients. Today our medicines and those entering our pipeline utilize our key technology advances, including our next generation chemistry, Generation 2.5, and our LICA technology.

Generation 2.5 chemistry, used in several medicines in our pipeline, enables up to 10-fold greater potency compared to our medicines using our earlier chemistries. This increased potency enables broad distribution throughout the body and target engagement to multiple tissues including liver, kidney, lung, muscle, adipose, adrenal gland, peripheral nerves and tumor tissues. Our Generation 2.5 medicines constitute some of the new medicines we recently added to our pipeline.

LICA is a chemical technology we developed that involves attaching a molecule called a ligand that binds with receptors on the surfaces of cells in a highly specific manner. Because these receptors are often found only on certain cell types, LICA allows us to increase effective delivery of our antisense medicines with higher specificity to certain cell types that express these receptors relative to non-conjugated antisense medicines. As of December 2020, we have an integrated assessment of data from multiple LICA medicines and over 1,200 subjects who have been treated with our LICA medicines, which demonstrates that our LICA technology for liver targets can increase potency by 20-30-fold over our non-LICA antisense medicines.

In addition to the increase in potency, the LICA platform has consistently demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability. Pelacarsen exemplifies these improvements. We designed this medicine to reduce the production of Apo(a) protein in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing Lp(a). Pelacarsen was the first and only medicine to selectively and robustly reduce Lp(a) levels below threshold levels associated with CVD in nearly all patients and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the Phase 2 study. The study included more than 280 patients, with 98 percent of patients in the high dose group achieving levels below 50 mg/dL, the recognized risk threshold for CVD.

We can also combine our LICA technology with our Generation 2.5 chemistry, further increasing potency. This increase in potency may enable oral delivery of our antisense medicines. In addition to the LICA technology for liver targets, we are also developing LICA conjugation technology that we can use to target other tissues, such as muscle, and initial results are promising.

Antisense Targets and Mechanisms

There are more than a dozen different antisense mechanisms that we can utilize with our antisense technology. The majority of the medicines in our pipeline bind to mRNAs and inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins. However, our antisense technology is broadly applicable to many different antisense mechanisms, including modulation of RNA splicing, RNA interference, or RNAi, and enhancing protein translation to increase protein production.

When using antisense technology to inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins or reduce levels of harmful RNAs, our antisense medicines bind to the target RNA via highly specific nucleotide pairing, or hybridization, and recruit a cellular enzyme called ribonuclease H1, or RNase H1, to degrade the target RNA. The antisense medicine itself remains intact during this process, so it can remain active against additional target RNA molecules and repeatedly trigger their degradation (Figure 4). Examples of our antisense medicines that use the RNase H1 mechanism to reduce disease protein production include, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, tominersen, pelacarsen, and others.

 
Figure 4: Antisense medicine using the RNase H mechanism of action.

SPINRAZA is an example of an antisense medicine that modulates RNA splicing to increase protein production of the SMN protein (Figure 5), which is critical to the health and survival of nerve cells in the spinal cord that are responsible for neuro-muscular function. The SMN protein is deficient in people with SMA. There are a number of other diseases, including cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which may be treated by modulating splicing using antisense technology.

Figure 5: Antisense medicine altering splicing of the SMN2 mRNA.

 
We are also making progress in designing antisense medicines to target long, non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs and RNAs that possess a toxic function in human diseases. Many of these RNAs, such as lncRNAs, do not make proteins but often cause disease by regulating the function of other genes or proteins. In 2014, we published a paper in Nature in which we were the first to show that targeted reduction of a lncRNA with an antisense compound can ameliorate certain cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome, or AS. Moreover, these studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic benefits of antisense medicines for the treatment of AS.

Because the efficiency of our core technology platform can support multiple target-based antisense research programs, we can develop antisense medicines to target a broad range of diseases, efficiently producing a large and broad proprietary portfolio of medicines. We are currently pursuing antisense drug discovery programs focused on neurological, cardiometabolic, and other diseases.

Under the terms of our agreement with Alnylam, we exclusively licensed to Alnylam our patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry for double-stranded RNAi therapeutics in exchange for a technology access fee, participation in fees from Alnylam’s partnering programs, as well as future milestone and royalty payments from Alnylam. We retained rights to a limited number of double-stranded RNAi therapeutic targets and all rights to single-stranded RNAi, or ssRNAi, therapeutics. In turn, Alnylam nonexclusively licensed to us its patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry to research, develop and commercialize single-stranded antisense therapeutics, ssRNAi therapeutics, and to research double-stranded RNAi compounds. We also received a license to develop and commercialize double-stranded RNAi medicines targeting a limited number of therapeutic targets on a nonexclusive basis. Additionally, in 2015, we and Alnylam entered into an alliance in which we cross-licensed intellectual property. Under this alliance, we and Alnylam each obtained exclusive license rights to four therapeutic programs. Alnylam granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to its chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against four targets, including FXI and Apo(a) and two other targets. In exchange, we granted Alnylam an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to our chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against four other targets. Alnylam also granted us a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to new platform technology arising from May 2014 through April 2019 for single-stranded antisense therapeutics. In turn, we granted Alnylam a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to new platform technology arising from May 2014 through April 2019 for double-stranded RNAi therapeutics.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed an arbitration process with Alnylam. The arbitration panel awarded us $41 million for payments owed to us by Alnylam related to Alnylam’s agreement with Sanofi Genzyme. We recognized the $41 million payment from Alnylam as R&D revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020.
  
The Ludwig Institute; Center for Neurological Studies


 We have a collaboration with the Ludwig Institute, the Center for Neurological Studies and researchers to discover and develop antisense medicines for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. Under this agreement, we agreed to pay the Ludwig Institute and the Center for Neurological Studies modest milestone payments and royalties on any antisense medicines resulting from the collaboration.
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture most of the drug product we use for our research and development activities ourselves. We have also manufactured commercial supply for our approved medicines. We have dedicated significant resources to develop ways to improve manufacturing efficiency and capacity. Since we can use variants of the same nucleotide building blocks and the same type of equipment to produce our oligonucleotide medicines, we found that the same techniques we used to efficiently manufacture one oligonucleotide medicine could help improve the manufacturing processes for our antisense medicines. By developing several proprietary chemical processes to scale up our manufacturing capabilities, we have greatly reduced the cost of producing oligonucleotide medicines. For example, we have significantly reduced the cost of raw materials through improved yield efficiency, while at the same time increasing our capacity to make our medicines. Through both our internal research and development programs and collaborations with outside vendors we may achieve even greater efficiency and further cost reductions.

Our manufacturing facility is located in a 26,800 square foot building in Carlsbad, California. We purchased this building in 2017. In addition, we have a 25,800 square foot building that houses support functions for our manufacturing activities. We lease this facility under a lease that has a term ending in August 2026 with an option to extend the lease for an additional five-year period. Our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign equivalents to ensure that it is operating in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements.

As part of our collaborations we may agree to manufacture clinical trial materials and/or commercial supply for our partners. For example, in the past we have manufactured clinical supply materials for AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK and Novartis and commercial supply materials for Biogen.
 
We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity at our own facility or at contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to meet our current internal research, development and potential commercial needs, as well as our obligations under existing agreements with our partners for research, development and commercial needs. We believe our current network of CMO partners are capable of providing sufficient quantities to meet anticipated commercial demands. Additionally, we continue to evaluate relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity and diversify our supply chain. While we believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our commercial requirements, it is possible that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, could result in significant delay or material additional costs. We also could experience a disruption in supply from our current CMO partners.

CMOs are subject to the FDA’s cGMP requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our CMO partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.

Specifically, we have the following in place for our approved medicines, SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA and our medicines in Phase 3 development: tominersen, tofersen, pelacarsen, IONIS-TTR-LRx and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx:

SPINRAZA

Since September 2018, Biogen has provided SPINRAZA drug supply. Biogen has an oligonucleotide synthesis manufacturing facility that gives it the capability to manufacture SPINRAZA.

TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA

For TEGSEDI’s commercial drug supply, we are using CMOs to produce custom raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished goods. For WAYLIVRA’s commercial drug supply, we have manufactured custom raw materials and API. We are using CMOs to produce the finished goods for WAYLIVRA. Our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise and cGMP experience. We believe our current network of CMO partners are capable of providing sufficient quantities to meet anticipated commercial demands.
Tominersen

Pursuant to our collaboration with Roche, Roche is responsible for tominersen drug supply.

 
Tofersen

We provided Biogen with the first batch of API for tofersen in 2015 to support the first in human studies under our collaboration agreement with Biogen. Pursuant to our collaboration with Biogen, Biogen is responsible for tofersen drug supply. Biogen has an oligonucleotide synthesis manufacturing facility that gives it the capability to manufacture tofersen for all subsequent clinical studies and potential commercialization, including providing the API for the current Phase 3 study.
Pelacarsen

We supplied the API and the finished drug product for pelacarsen’s Phase 3 study. Pursuant to our collaboration with Novartis, Novartis is responsible for any further pelacarsen drug supply.
Wholly Owned Phase 3 Medicines: IONIS-TTR-LRx, IONIS-APOCIII-LRx

We have supplied the API and the finished drug product for IONIS-TTR-LRx and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx that we believe will be sufficient through the completion of the Phase 3 programs for each medicine. We plan to leverage our relationships with CMOs to procure long-term raw material and drug supplies at competitive prices in the future.

LICA Medicines

We have manufactured and used CMOs to manufacture our LICA medicines for our preclinical and clinical studies. LICA enables lower doses than unconjugated oligonucleotides. With our expertise in optimizing manufacturing of oligonucleotides, we believe we can scale up manufacturing of our LICA medicines at commercially competitive prices or use CMO’s.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products in the U.S. and other countries. We own or have exclusively licensed a substantial patent estate with numerous issued patents worldwide protecting our products and, more generally, our platform for development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics. We focus our resources on patents and new patent applications that drive value for our company.
 
We own or control patents that provide exclusivity for products in our pipeline and patents that provide exclusivity for our core technology in the field of antisense more generally. Our core technology patents include claims to chemically modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides as well as antisense medicine designs utilizing these chemically modified nucleosides. These core claims are independent of specific therapeutic target, nucleic acid sequence, or clinical indication. We also own a large number of patents claiming antisense compounds having nucleic acid sequences complementary to therapeutic target nucleic acids, independent of the particular chemical modifications incorporated into the antisense compound. Most importantly, we seek and obtain issued patent claims to specifically protect each of our medicines. For example, we file and seek to obtain claims covering each drug’s nucleic acid sequence and precise drug design. In sum, we maintain our competitive advantage in the field of antisense technology by protecting our core platform technology and by creating multiple layers of patent protection for each of our specific medicines in development.


Type of Patent Claim(Broadly Applicable to Specific) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● Chemically Modified Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides (target and sequence independent)● Antisense Drug Design Motifs (target and sequence independent)● Therapeutic Methods (sequence and chemistry independent)● Antisense Sequence (chemistry independent)● Drug Composition

Chemically Modified Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides
 
The most broadly applicable of our patents are those that claim modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides comprising the modified nucleosides that we incorporate into our antisense medicines to increase their therapeutic efficacy. Nucleosides and chemically modified nucleosides are the basic building blocks of our antisense medicines. Therefore claims that cover any oligonucleotide incorporating one of our proprietary modified nucleosides can apply to a wide array of antisense mechanisms of action as well as several therapeutic targets. Of particular note are our patents covering our proprietary 2’-O-(2-methoxy) ethyl, or “MOE,” modified nucleosides, incorporated into many of our second-generation development compounds, as well as our constrained-ethyl nucleosides, or “cEt” nucleosides incorporated into our Generation 2.5 compounds. The following are some of our patents in this category in key jurisdictions (U.S., Europe and Japan):

Jurisdiction | Patent No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 7,101,993 | OLIGONUCLEOTIDES CONTAINING 2’-O-MODIFIED PURINES | 2023 | Certain MOE nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing these nucleotides
United States | 7,399,845 | 6-MODIFIED BICYCLIC NUCLEIC ACID ANALOGS | 2027 | cEt nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing these nucleoside analogs 
United States | 7,741,457 | 6-MODIFIED BICYCLIC NUCLEIC ACID ANALOGS | 2027 | cEt nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing these nucleoside analogs 
United States | 8,022,193 | 6-MODIFIED BICYCLIC NUCLEIC ACID ANALOGS | 2027 | Oligonucleotides containing cEt nucleoside analogs

United States | 7,569,686 | COMPOUNDS AND METHODS FOR SYNTHESIS OF BICYCLIC NUCLEIC ACID ANALOGS | 2027 | Methods of synthesizing cEt nucleosides 

Antisense Drug Design Motifs
 
We also have patents that claim oligonucleotides comprising antisense drug design motifs, or patterns of nucleoside modifications at specified positions in the oligonucleotide. Patent claims covering our antisense drug design motifs are independent of nucleic acid sequence, so they cover oligonucleotides having the recited motif, regardless of cellular target or clinical indication. The claimed motifs generally confer properties that optimize oligonucleotides for a particular antisense mechanism of action, such as ribonuclease H (RNase H), RNAi, or splicing. We have designed oligonucleotides incorporating motifs, which we refer to as chimeric compounds or gapmers, to exploit the RNase H mechanism to achieve target RNA reduction. Almost all of our medicines in clinical development, including TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, but excluding SPINRAZA, contain this gapmer antisense drug design motif. We own a U.S. patent that covers all of our second-generation MOE gapmer antisense medicines until March of 2023.

 
In addition, we have patent claims to antisense drug design motifs incorporating bicyclic nucleosides, which include both locked nucleic acids, or “LNA” and cEt. In Europe, we have been granted claims drawn to certain gapmer oligonucleotides with bicyclic nucleosides, which include locked nucleic acids in the wings. We have also successfully obtained issued patent claims covering our Generation 2.5 gapmer antisense drug design motifs that incorporate our cEt modified nucleosides. The following patents are some examples of our issued patents in this category in key jurisdictions (U.S., Europe and Japan):


Jurisdiction | Patent No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 7,015,315 | GAPPED OLIGONUCLEOTIDES | 2023 | Gapmer oligonucleotides having 2’-O-alkyl-O-alkyl nucleosides

United States | 10,493,092 | ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS | 2028 | Gapmer oligonucleotides having BNA nucleosides and 2’-MOE nucleosides and/or 2’-OMe nucleosides 
Europe | 3067421 | OLIGOMERIC COMPOUNDS COMPRISING BICYCLIC NUCLEOTIDES AND USES THEREOF | 2032 | Gapmer oligonucleotides having at least one bicyclic, one 2’-modified nucleoside and one 2’-deoxynucleoside 


LIgand-Conjugated Antisense (LICA) Technology

We also have patent claims to new chemistries created to enhance targeting of antisense medicines to specific tissues and cells to improve a drug’s properties. We designed our N-acetyl-galactosamine, or GalNAc, LICA medicines to provide an increase in potency for targets in the liver. We have successfully obtained issued patent claims covering our LICA technology conjugated to any modified oligonucleotide, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides. The following patents are some examples of our issued patents in this category:


Jurisdiction | Patent | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 9,127,276 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Preferred THA LICA conjugated to any group of nucleosides, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides 
United States | 9,181,549 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Preferred THA conjugate having our preferred linker and cleavable moiety conjugated to any oligomeric compound or any nucleoside having a 2’-MOE modification or a cEt modification
Europe | 2991661 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Preferred THA LICA conjugated to any group of nucleosides, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides 

Therapeutic Methods of Treatment and Antisense Drug Sequences
 
In addition to our broad core patents, we also own hundreds of patents, worldwide, with claims to antisense compounds having particular sequences and compounds directed to particular therapeutically important targets or methods of achieving cellular or clinical endpoints using these antisense compounds. These “Target” patents also include claims reciting the specific nucleic acid sequences utilized by our products, independent of chemical modifications and motifs. In addition, our product-specific patents typically include claims combining specific nucleic acid sequences with nucleoside modifications and motifs. In this way, we seek patent claims narrowly tailored to protect our products specifically, in addition to the broader core antisense patents described above.

 
SPINRAZA and Survival Motor Neuron

We believe SPINRAZA is protected from generic competition in the U.S. and Europe until at least 2030 by a suite of patents. These issued patents include: (i) patents licensed from the University of Massachusetts drawn to antisense compounds having the sequence of SPINRAZA, independent of chemical modification and uses of such compounds for treating SMA, and (ii) joint patents with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory claiming fully modified 2’MOE compositions targeting SMN2, including the precise composition of matter of SPINRAZA and methods of using such compositions. We have filed for patent term extension, to potentially extend the term beyond 2030. With Biogen’s license of SPINRAZA, we assigned our interest in these patents to Biogen. The table below lists some key issued patents protecting SPINRAZA in the U.S. and Europe:

We seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each medicine in development. We also seek to maximize patent term. In some cases, the patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during FDA regulatory review. The patent exclusivity period for a medicine will prevent generic medicines from entering the market. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors including initial patent term and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process.

Manufacturing Patents
 
We also own patents claiming methods of manufacturing and purifying oligonucleotides. These patents claim methods for improving oligonucleotide drug manufacturing, including processes for large-scale oligonucleotide synthesis and purification. These methods allow us to manufacture oligonucleotides at lower cost by, for example, eliminating expensive manufacturing steps.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in antisense therapeutics.

Government Regulation
 
Regulation by government authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant component in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and services. In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and relevant foreign regulatory authorities, we are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state and local regulations.
 
Extensive regulation by the U.S. and foreign governmental authorities governs the development, manufacture and sale of our medicines. In particular, our medicines are subject to a number of approval requirements by the FDA in the U.S. under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other laws and by comparable agencies in those foreign countries in which we conduct business. The FDCA and other various federal, state and foreign statutes govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, quality, and import and export of our medicines. State, local, and other authorities also regulate pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and procedures.
 
Our manufacturing facility and our CMOs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other foreign equivalents to ensure that they are operating in compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, marketing authorization for each new medicine may require a rigorous manufacturing pre-approval inspection by regulatory authorities. Post approval, there are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and, depending on the significance of the change, changes may require prior FDA approval. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.
 
The FDA must approve any new medicine before a manufacturer can market it in the U.S. In order to obtain approval, we and our partners must complete clinical studies and prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA. If the FDA approves a medicine, it will issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the medicine and may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure the benefits of the medicine outweigh the potential risks. For example, TEGSEDI has a REMS program. The requirements for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of our medicines. In foreign jurisdictions, the drug approval process is similarly demanding.

For any approved medicine, domestic and foreign sales of the medicine depend, in part, on the availability and amount of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments and private health plans. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product, or procedures which utilize such product. Private health plans may seek to manage cost and use of our medicines by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. For example, third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of U.S. FDA-approved products for a particular indication. In certain jurisdictions, governments may also regulate or influence coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of our medicines to control cost or affect use. Within the EU a variety of payors pay for medicines, with governments being the primary source of payment. Negotiating pricing with governmental authorities can delay commercialization. Such pricing and reimbursement factors could impact our ability and that of our commercial partners to successfully commercialize approved medicines. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

 
In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels and by foreign governments that seek to reduce healthcare costs. There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in efforts to bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medicines. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.

Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include, for example, the following:


● | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Foreign and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in the EU; and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, in California, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of medicines, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing

Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state and local government authorities, regulate sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval. As described above, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for drugs under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those we tested and the FDA approved. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. If we do not comply with applicable FDA requirements, we may face adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Promotion of off-label uses of drugs can also implicate the false claims laws described below.

In the U.S. sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, limited statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the PPACA among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our drugs may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing.

 
Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals can bring similar actions. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; analogous state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.
 Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drugs in the E.U. and other countries. Even in those countries where we may not be directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our medicines, if our potential international distribution partners engage in inappropriate activity, it can have adverse implications for us.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits certain individuals and entities, including us, from promising, paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business or an improper advantage. If we violate the FCPA, it could result in large civil and criminal penalties as well as an adverse effect on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. We could also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of export privileges.

Competition

Our Business in General
 
Some of our medicines may compete with existing therapies for market share and some of our medicines in development may compete for patients in study trials. In addition, there are a number of companies pursuing the development of oligonucleotide-based technologies and the development of pharmaceuticals utilizing these technologies. These companies include biopharmaceutical companies and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together. Our medicines are differentiated from traditional small molecule medicines by their chemistry, how they move in the body, how they act in the body, delivery technology, and formulations.

Our approved products and our products under development address numerous markets. The diseases our medicines target for which we have or may receive marketing authorization will determine our competition. For some of our products, an important factor may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and marketing authorization processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market are important competitive factors. We expect to compete with products approved for sale based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, product efficacy, safety, mechanism of action, dosing convenience, marketing and sales strategy and tactics, availability, price, and reimbursement.

Below we have included what we believe to be the competitive landscape for our marketed medicines and for the medicines we currently have in Phase 3 trials. We have included medicines that we believe compete or may compete directly with our medicines. We included competitors, potential competitors that are past Phase 1 development or potential competitors that plan to start a pivotal study this year. We do not believe that any medicines meet these criteria to compete with pelacarsen.

 
SPINRAZA

We consider the following medicines as competitors and potential future competitors to SPINRAZA for the indication of SMA:


Medicine | Company | Medicine Description (1) | Phase (1) | Route of Administration (1)
-------------------------+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------
Onasemnogene abeparvovec | Novartis | Gene therapy targeting the genetic root cause of SMA by replacing the missing or nonworking SMN1 gene | Approved for Type 1 infants younger than two years old | Intravenous infusion 
Risdiplam | PTC/ Roche/ SMA Foundation | A small molecule medicine that modulates splicing of the SMN2 gene | Approved in the U.S. | Oral 


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In May 2019, onasemnogene abeparvovec was approved for the treatment of pediatric patients less than two years of age with SMA including those who are presymptomatic at diagnosis.

In August 2020, the FDA approved risdiplam for the treatment of SMA in adults and children two months of age and older.

TEGSEDI and IONIS-TTR-LRx

We consider the following medicines as competitors and potential future competitors to TEGSEDI and IONIS-TTR-LRx for the indication of hATTR amyloidosis and/or ATTR cardiomyopathy:


Medicine | Company | Medicine Description (1) | Phase (1) | Route of Administration (1)
----------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------
Patisiran | Alnylam | An RNAi medicine formulated with lipid nanoparticles to inhibit TTR mRNA | Approved hATTR/Phase 3 ATTR-CM | Intravenous infusion 
Tafamidis and tafamidis meglumine | Pfizer | A small molecule medicine to stabilize TTR protein | Approved in U.S., EU, Japan and select other markets for hATTR-PN and/or ATTR-CM; indications vary by region | Oral 
Vutrisiran | Alnylam | An RNAi medicine conjugated with GalNAC to inhibit TTR mRNA | 3 | Subcutaneous Injection 
Acoramidis | Bridgebio | Small molecule that binds and stabilizes TTR in the blood | 3 | Oral 


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our main competition for TEGSEDI is patisiran, marketed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Although patisiran requires intravenous administration by a healthcare provider every three weeks and pre-treatment with steroids, it does not have a boxed warning or REMS as TEGSEDI does.

We believe that Alnylam’s patisiran and vutrisiran could compete directly against IONIS-TTR-LRx, given their transthyretin-silencing profile. While their approved indications vary by market, the transthyretin stabilizers, tafamidis/ tafamidis meglumine, marketed by Pfizer, are currently the only approved products for the treatment of ATTR-CM.

 
WAYLIVRA and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx

We believe that the following medicines could compete with WAYLIVRA and IONIS-APOCIII-LRx in FCS:


Medicine | Company | Medicine Description (1) | Phase (1) | Route of Administration (1)
-----------+---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+----------------------------
Lomitapide | Amryt Pharma | Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor | 2 | Oral 
ARO-APOC3 | Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals | Targets APOCIII by utilizing Targeted RNAi Molecule Platform | 1/2 | Subcutaneous Injections 
Gemcabene | NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals | Dicarboxylic acid with antihyperlipidemic activity | 2 | Oral 


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tominersen

We believe that the following medicines could compete with tominersen in Huntington’s Disease:


Medicine | Company | Medicine Description (1) | Phase (1) | Route of Administration (1) 
-----------------------+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------
WVE-120101/ WVE-120102 | Wave Life Sciences | Antisense medicines targeting mHTT SNP-1 and SNP-2 | 1b/2a | IntrathecalInfusion 
Selisistat | AOP Orphan | An orally active, selective SIRT1 inhibitor | 2 | Oral 
VX15 | Vaccinex | A monoclonal antibody that blocks the activity of SEMA4D | 2 | IntravenousInfusion 
AMT-130 | UniQure | HTT-silencing micro-RNA gene therapy | 1/2 | MRI-guided stereotaxic infusion


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We believe that Wave Life Sciences’ WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, being developed for Huntington’s Disease, could compete directly against tominersen. These medicines are antisense medicines administered intrathecally, targeting mHTT SNP-1 and SNP-2, respectively. Wave Life Sciences is currently conducting two simultaneous Phase 1b/2a clinical trials, enrolling adults with early manifest Huntington’s disease who carry a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, at the SNP1 and SNP2 location.

UniQure has been developing AMT-130, a gene therapy for Huntington’s Disease that consists of an AA5 vector carrying an artificial micro-RNA to target mHTT gene.

Tofersen

We believe that the following medicines could potentially compete with tofersen:


Medicine | Company | Medicine Description (1) | Phase (1) | Route of Administration (1)
------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+----------------------------
Arimoclomol | Orphazyme | Provides cellular protection from abnormal proteins by activating molecular “chaperone” proteins that can repair or degrade the damaged proteins | 3 | Oral 
Ultomiris | Alexion | Anti-C5 monoclonal antibody | 3 | IntravenousInfusion 
Masitinib | AB Science | Selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor | 3 | Oral 
Trehalose | Seelos | A disaccharide that stabilizes proteins and activates autophagy to clear materials from damaged cells | 2/3 | IntravenousInfusion 


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations.

We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.

In 2018, we engaged an independent third-party expert to perform a pay equity analysis which reviewed pay equity by gender and race. We plan to continue to engage a third-party expert to review pay equity every two to three years, as we determine necessary.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

 At Ionis, we encourage diversity in our workforce. Prejudicial barriers to human potential and productivity are foreign to our values. We recognize that in order for the full potential of our workforce to be realized, we must cultivate an inclusive culture where all employees feel empowered to contribute fully in an environment that values different perspectives, leading to better ​​​​​​​ideas and increased innovation.
Training and Development

We designed our training and development programs to help employees gain important Ionis knowledge and develop the skills to be successful. All of our trainings from new hire through senior leader, are focused on the Ionis culture and core principles and learning what we mean when we say: “Working the Ionis Way.”

We empower our employees to build rewarding careers at Ionis, driven by a culture of yes that encourages personal and professional employee growth. Ionis offers robust training opportunities with course offerings and events available to every employee regardless of level or function.
