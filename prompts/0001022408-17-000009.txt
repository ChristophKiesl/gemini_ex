OUR INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND MARKET OPPORTUNITY
 
We participate in the large and growing United States IT market which, according to Gartner, Inc. is estimated to generate sales of over $1.12 trillion in 2017, and is expected to grow by 3.1% in calendar year 2017 and at an annual rate of approximately 3.1% for 2016 through 20211.
 
We have focused on and identified several specific trends that we believe will create higher growth in the broader U.S. IT market:
 
 
· | Hybrid IT Strategy. Over the past several years, cloud architectures and cloud-enabled frameworks, whether public, private, or hybrid, have become the core foundation of modern IT. Our strategy is to assist our clients in assessing, defining and deploying private and hybrid clouds that align with their business needs. This strategy leverages our strength in deploying private clouds, while also incorporating elements of the public cloud. By assessing their applications, workloads, business requirements, etc., we deploy solutions that leverage the best of all technology platforms and consumption models. For example, we may build a private cloud solution to host mission critical applications, while creating a public cloud solution for development, collaboration, or disaster recovery. As the market continues to mature, we will continue to build and acquire skills that align with agile development (DevOps), application refactoring and analytics. Our cloud strategy is tightly aligned with all of our key strategic initiatives, including security, digital infrastructure, and IT.

· | Increasing sophistication and incidences of IT security breaches and cyber-attacks. Over the last decade, cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated, more numerous and pervasive, and increasingly difficult to safeguard against. Most experts believe that it isn’t a matter of if a cyber attack will affect an organization; it’s a matter of when and how often. We believe our customers are focused on all aspects of cyber security, including intellectual property, data and business processes, as well as compliance with an increasing number of general and industry-specific government regulations. In order to meet current and future security threats, enterprises must implement solutions that are fully-integrated and capable of monitoring, detecting, containing and remediating security threats and attacks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Disruptive technologies are creating complexity and challenges for customers and vendors. The rapid evolution of disruptive technologies, and the speed by which they impact organizations’ IT infrastructures, has made it difficult for customers to effectively design, procure, implement and manage their own IT systems. Moreover, increased budget pressures, fewer internal resources, a fragmented vendor landscape and fast time-to-value expectations make it challenging for customers to design, implement and manage secure, efficient and cost-effective IT environments. Customers are increasingly turning to IT solutions providers such as ePlus to implement these complex IT offerings such as software defined infrastructure, cloud computing, converged and hyper-converged infrastructures, big data analytics, and flash storage
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Customer IT decision making is shifting from IT departments to line-of- business personnel. As IT consumption shifts from legacy, on-premise infrastructure to agile ‘on-demand’ and ‘as-a-service’ solutions, customer procurement decisions are being shifted from traditional IT personnel to lines-of-business personnel, which is changing the customer engagement model and types of consultative services required to fulfill customer needs. In addition, many of the services create recurring revenue streams paid over time, rather than upfront revenue.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lack of sufficient internal IT resources at mid-sized and large enterprises, and scarcity of IT personnel in certain high-demand disciplines. We believe that IT departments at mid-sized and large enterprises are facing pressure to deliver emerging technologies and business outcomes, but lack the properly trained staff and the ability to hire personnel with high demand disciplines such as security and data analytics. At the same time the prevalence of security threats, increased use of cloud computing, software-defined networking, new architectures and rapid software development frameworks, the proliferation of mobile devices and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies, and complexity of multi-vendor solutions, have made it difficult for IT departments to implement high-quality IT solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduction in the number of IT solutions providers. We believe that customers are seeking to reduce the number of solutions providers they do business with to improve supply chain and internal efficiencies, enhance accountability, improve supplier management practices and reduce costs. As a result, customers are required to select IT solutions providers that are capable of delivering complex multi-vendor IT solutions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increasing need for third-party services. We believe that customers are relying on third-party service providers to manage significant aspects of their IT environment, from design, implementation, pre- and post-sales support, maintenance, engineering, cloud management, security operations, and other services.

COMPETITION
 
The market for IT solutions is highly competitive, subject to macro-economic cycles and the entry of new competitors, and is significantly affected by disruptive technologies and other market activities of industry participants. We expect to continue to compete in all areas of our business against local, regional, national and international firms, including: vendors, international, national and regional resellers and service providers. Many of our competitors are direct marketers with a little value add, and sell products as commodities which can place downward pressure on product pricing. In addition, many IT vendors may sell or lease directly to our customers, and our continued ability to compete effectively may be affected by the policies of such vendors. We face indirect competition from potential customers’ internal development efforts and have to overcome potential customers’ reluctance to move away from legacy systems, processes, and solution providers. As IT consumption shifts from IT personnel and legacy infrastructure to line-of-business based outcomes utilizing off-premise, on-demand, and cloud solutions, the legacy resale model is shifting from upfront sales to recurring revenue model.
 
The leasing market is also competitive and subject to changing economic conditions and market activities of leading industry participants. We expect to continue to compete against local, regional, national and international firms, including banks, specialty finance companies, vendors' captive finance companies, and third-party leasing companies. Banks and other large financial services companies sell directly to business customers, particularly larger enterprise customers, and may provide other financial or ancillary services that we do not provide. Vendor captive leasing companies may utilize internal transfer pricing to effectively lower lease rates and/or bundle equipment sales and leasing to provide highly competitive packages to customers. Third-party leasing companies may have deep customer relationships with contracts in place that are difficult to displace. However, these competitors typically do not provide the breadth of product, service, and software offerings that we provide to our customers.
 
In all of our markets, some of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and customer requirements. Many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional marketing and advertising activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do.

OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
 
Large Addressable Market with Substantial Growth Opportunities Driven by Increasing IT Complexity
 
We participate in the large and growing IT market with specific focus on the data center, network, cloud, security, virtualization and mobility segments of the industry, facilitated by our professional and managed service solutions. We believe we are well positioned in the complex high-growth IT solutions segment and can achieve outsized growth relative to the overall IT market.
 
 7
 

 Our products and services are targeted at large and the approximately 50,000 middle market companies, state and local governmental organizations and educational institutions in the United States and target international companies through our operations in the U.K. We believe IT organizations within these companies are facing pressure to deliver higher service levels with fewer resources, increasing their reliance on third parties who can provide complex, multi-vendor technology solutions, such as our company.
 
Broad and Diverse Customer Base across a Wide Range of End Markets
 
We have a broad and diverse customer base of over 3,200 customers across a wide range of end markets, including education, financial services, healthcare, media and entertainment, state and local government, technology and telecommunications.
Differentiated Business Model Serving Entire IT Lifecycle – Solutions, Services, Software, Financing
 
We believe we are a trusted IT advisor, delivering differentiated products and services to enable our customers to meet increasingly complex IT requirements. We are able to provide complete, turn-key solutions serving the entire IT lifecycle – products, services, software and financing. We provide upfront assessments, configuration capabilities, installation and implementation, and ongoing services to support our customers’ solutions.
Deep Expertise in Advanced Technology to Address Emerging Cloud, Data Center and IT Infrastructure Trends
 
We believe our customers choose us for their complex IT infrastructure needs based on our track record of delivering best-of-breed solutions, value-added services and close relationships with both established and emerging vendors.
Strategic Ability to Design and Integrate Cloud Solutions Across Multiple Vendors
 
We believe our relationships with vendors focused on the design and integration of cloud systems allow us to provide differentiated, cloud offerings. We have developed long standing, strategic partnerships with leading cloud systems vendors, including Cisco Systems, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, NetApp, and VMware.
 
Our vendor agnostic approach allows us to provide the best customer-specific solutions. Our experienced professionals are trained in various product lines across vendors and have achieved top-level certifications with multiple strategic partners. In addition to providing initial products, our vendor certifications allow us to contract the assumption of many of the day-to-day maintenance and servicing functions for these products.
 
Proven Track Record of Successfully Integrating Acquisitions and Accelerating Growth
 
We view acquisitions as an important factor in our strategic growth plan. Since 1997, we have successfully integrated 20 acquisitions. Most recently, we have been active in tuck-in acquisitions to broaden our product offerings, sector reach and geographic footprint, with recent acquisitions including:

• | Consolidated Communications IT services and integration business (“Consolidated IT Services”), providing data center, unified communications, networking, and security solutions - Expansion of sales presence in the upper Midwest.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IGX Acquisition Global LLC , and IGX Support, LLC, including IGX Acquisition’s wholly-owned subsidiary, IGXGlobal UK Limited (collectively, "IGX") - Expansion of sales presence in New York and New England, as well as an operating branch in London that serves the United Kingdom and global customers;

Financial Performance Characterized by Growth and Profitability
 
We have focused on achieving top-line revenue growth while maintaining industry-leading gross margins – with a compound annual growth rate of 10.0% on net sales and 11.8% for consolidated gross profit, respectively, from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2017.
 
Through our organic expansion and acquisitions, we have increased our employee base by 41% from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2017 while increasing revenue per employee by approximately 14%. The increase in our employee base has largely been in customer facing roles.
 
GROWTH STRATEGY
 
Our goal is to continue to grow as a leading provider of technology solutions. The key elements of our strategy include the following:
 
Be Our Customers’ Partner of Choice for IT Solutions, Which May Include Services, and Financing Needs
 
We seek to become the primary provider of IT solutions for each of our customers by delivering IT solutions whether on-premise, cloud, or managed services-based. We provide excellent customer service, pricing, availability, and advanced professional and managed services in an efficient manner. We believe the increasing complexity of the IT ecosystem and the emergence of new technologies and vendors are factors that will lead to a growing demand from existing customers. We continue to focus on improving our sales efficiency by providing on-going training and targeted incentive compensation, as well as implementing better automation processes to reduce costs and improve productivity. We have a large number of experienced pre-sales engineers who are able to engage with customers about the most advanced technologies. Our account executives are trained on our broad solutions capabilities and to sell in a consultative manner that increases the likelihood of cross-selling our solutions, and are supported by expert inside sales representatives. We believe that our bundled offerings are an important differentiating factor from our competitors.
 
We focus on gaining top-level engineering certifications and professional services expertise in advanced technologies of strategic vendors. This expertise helps our customers develop their cloud capabilities including private, public, and hybrid infrastructures. We are providing virtual desktop infrastructure, unified communications, collaboration, networking, security, storage, big-data, mobility, converged and hyper-converged infrastructures, and managed services offerings, all of which remain in high demand. We believe our ability to deliver advanced professional services provides benefits in two ways. First, we gain recognition and mindshare of our strategic vendor partners and become the “go-to” partner in selected regional markets as well as the national market. This significantly increases direct and referral sales opportunities for our products and services, and allows us to offer competitive pricing levels. Second, within our existing and potential customer base, our advanced professional services are a key differentiator against competitors who cannot provide services or advanced services for these key technologies or across multiple vendor product lines.
 
During the last fiscal year, we have expanded our managed services offerings to include support for certain Palto Alto products, expanded our unified communications offerings to include call recording and support of Software Defined Networking with LiveAction performance analytics. We broadened our partner network to include additional security operations services, managed desktop services, and patch management. We also expanded our engineering resource pool with the supplementation of engineering talent from our CCI acquisition.
 
Build Our Geographic Footprint
 
We intend to increase our direct sales and go-to-market capabilities in each of our geographic areas. We actively seek to acquire new account relationships through face-to-face field sales, electronic commerce (especially OneSource®), leveraging our partnerships with vendors, and targeted demand-generation activities to increase awareness of our solutions. We also seek to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic reach, and improve our technology and professional services delivery capabilities.

Recruit, Retain and Develop Employees
 
Based on our prior experience, capital structure, and business systems and processes, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of hiring experienced sales people and engineers, make strategic acquisitions that broaden our customer base, expand our geographic reach, scale our existing operating structure, and/or enhance our product and service offerings. Part of our growth strategy is to hire purposefully, and evaluate strategic hiring opportunities if and when they become available. During the year ended March 31, 2017, as part of our expansion strategy, our customer facing sales and professional services team grew from 799 to 893.
Improve Operational Efficiencies
 
We continue to invest in our internal technology infrastructure and software platforms to optimize our operations, and to engage in process re-engineering efforts to become more streamlined and cost effective.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
We incur software development costs associated with maintaining, enhancing or upgrading our proprietary software, which may be performed by internal IT development resources or by an offshore software-development company that we use to supplement our internal development team.
SALES AND MARKETING
 
We focus our sales and marketing efforts on becoming the primary provider of IT solutions for each of our customers. We seek to acquire new account relationships through face-to-face field sales, leveraging our partnerships with manufacturers and targeted direct marketing to increase awareness of our solutions. We target enterprises, primarily middle market companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2.5 billion and large companies. We currently have over 3,200 customers. We undertake direct marketing campaigns to target certain markets in conjunction with our primary vendor partners, who may provide financial reimbursement, outsourced services, and personnel to assist us in these efforts.
 
Our sales representatives are compensated by a combination of salary and commission, with commission becoming the primary component of compensation as the sales representatives gain experience. To date, we acquired a majority of our customers through the efforts of our direct sales force and acquisitions. We market to different areas within a customer’s organization, including business units as well as the IT department, depending on the solutions.
 
As of March 31, 2017, our sales force consisted of 493 sales, marketing and sales support personnel organized regionally in 35 office locations throughout the United States and United Kingdom.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 
Our success depends in part upon proprietary business methodologies and technologies that we have licensed and modified. We own certain software programs or have entered into software licensing agreements to provide services to our customers. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret protection, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection.
 
For example in the United States we have six catalog management patents, three image transmission management patents, a patent for collaborative editing of electronic documents over a network, a hosted asset information management patent, and an eCatalog supplier portal patent, among others. The three image transmission patents are scheduled to expire in 2018; the earliest of the catalog management patents is scheduled to expire in 2024; and the patent for collaborative editing of electronic documents over a network is scheduled to expire in 2025, provided that all maintenance fees are paid in accordance with USPTO regulations. We also have certain patent rights in some European forums, Japan, and Canada. We cannot provide assurance that any patents, as issued, will prevent the development of competitive products or that our patents will not be successfully challenged by others or invalidated through the administrative process or litigation.
 
Our trademarks in the United States include ePlus®, eCloud ®, Procure+®, Manage+®, Docpak®, Viewmark®, OneSource®, and Where Technology Means More®. We intend to use and protect these and our other marks, as we deem necessary. We believe our trademarks have significant value and are an important factor in the marketing of our products. In addition to our trademarks, we have over 20 registered copyrights and additional common-law trademarks and copyrights.
 
 10
 

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and can be expensive, and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists, software piracy could be expected to be a persistent problem. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design around our proprietary intellectual property.
 
FINANCIAL AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
 
Inventory Management: We have drop-shipment arrangements with many of our vendors and distributors, which permit us to offer products to our customers without having to take physical delivery of the equipment. Arrow Enterprises, Ingram Micro, Tech Data, Westcon-Comstor, and Synnex Corporation are the largest distributors we utilize. Using the distribution systems available, we frequently sell products that are shipped from the vendors or distributors directly to our customers’ location, which allows us to keep our inventory of any product and shipping expenses to a minimum. For the year ended March 31, 2017, our largest distributors accounted for 33% of our purchases related to our technology segment net sales.
 
Sales of products manufactured by Cisco Systems, HPE, and NetApp, whether purchased directly from these vendors or through distributors, represented 47%, 6%, and 5%, respectively, of our technology segment net sales for the year ended March 31, 2017. Our flexible platform and customizable catalogs facilitate the addition of new vendors with minimal incremental effort.
 
Risk Management and Process Controls: We use and maintain conservative underwriting policies and disciplined credit approval processes in both our technology and financing segments. We have an executive management review process and other internal controls in place to evaluate the transactions’ potential risk.
 
In our technology segment, we manage our risk by using conservative credit quality analysis and periodic monitoring of customer financial results or third-party risk evaluation tools; monitoring customer accounts receivable balances and payment history; proactively pursuing delinquent accounts; ensuring we have appropriate contractual terms and conditions; perfecting security interests when appropriate; requiring prepayment or deposits if indicated; performing fraud checks for new accounts; and evaluating general economic as well as industry specific trends. Our systems automatically decrease trade credit lines based on assigned risk ratings.
 
In our financing segment, we manage our risk in assets we finance by assigning the contractual payments due under the financing arrangement to third parties. We also use agency purchase orders to procure equipment for lease to our customers and otherwise take measures to minimize our inventory of financed assets. When our technology segment is the supplier of the assets being financed, we retain certain procurement risks. Our financing arrangements with our customers are generally fixed-rate.
 
Credit Risk Loss Experience: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we increased our reserves for credit losses by $199 thousand, and incurred actual credit losses of $78 thousand. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we decreased our reserves for credit losses by $272 thousand, incurred actual credit losses of $188 thousand and had recoveries of $30 thousand.
