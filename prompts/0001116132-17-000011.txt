GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
Founded in 1941, Coach Inc. was acquired by Sara Lee Corporation (“Sara Lee”) in 1985. In June 2000, the Company was incorporated in the state of Maryland. In October 2000, Coach was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and sold approximately 19.5% of the then outstanding shares. In April 2001, Sara Lee completed a distribution of its remaining ownership in Coach via an exchange offer, which allowed Sara Lee stockholders to tender Sara Lee common stock for Coach common stock.
The Company's international expansion strategy for the Coach brand has been to enter into joint ventures and distributor relationships to build market presence and capability. To further accelerate brand awareness, aggressively grow market share and to exercise greater control of our brand, Coach has historically acquired its partner’s interests.

• | In fiscal 2001, Coach Japan was initially formed as a joint venture with Sumitomo Corporation. In fiscal 2005, we purchased Sumitomo’s 50% interest in Coach Japan.


• | In fiscal 2011, the Company purchased a non-controlling interest in a joint venture with Hackett Limited to expand the Coach business in Europe. Through the joint venture, the Company opened retail locations in Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom in fiscal 2011, in France and Ireland in fiscal 2012 and in Germany in fiscal 2013. In the beginning of fiscal 2014, the Company purchased Hackett Limited’s remaining 50% interest in the joint venture, and has continued to expand its presence in Europe.


• | Coach acquired the domestic retail businesses from its distributors as follows:


- | Fiscal 2009: Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China (“Greater China”).


- | Fiscal 2012: Singapore and Taiwan.


- | Fiscal 2013: Malaysia and South Korea.

During fiscal 2015, the Company acquired Stuart Weitzman, a luxury women's footwear company, to complement its leadership position in premium handbags and accessories. The operating results of the Stuart Weitzman brand have been consolidated in the Company's operating results commencing on May 4, 2015. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company acquired the Stuart Weitzman Canadian retail distributor.
On July 11, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Kate Spade & Company for $18.50 per share in cash for a total of $2.4 billion. As a result, Kate Spade has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Coach, Inc. The combination of Coach, Inc. and Kate Spade & Company creates a leading luxury lifestyle company with a more diverse multi-brand portfolio supported by significant expertise in handbag design, merchandising, supply chain and retail operations as well as solid financial acumen. 
SEGMENTS
In fiscal 2017, the Company has three reportable segments:

• | North America, which is composed of Coach brand sales to consumers through stores, including the Internet, and sales to wholesale customers in North America. This segment represented 52.3% of Coach's total net sales in fiscal 2017.


• | International, which is composed of Coach brand sales to consumers through stores and concession shop-in-shops in Japan, mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Italy, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Additionally, International includes Coach brand sales to consumers through the Internet in Japan, mainland China, South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany and Italy, as well as sales to wholesale customers and distributors in approximately 55 countries. This segment represented 38.2% of total net sales in fiscal 2017.


• | Stuart Weitzman, which includes global sales generated by the Stuart Weitzman brand, primarily within international locations through independent distributors, department stores in North America and within Stuart Weitzman directly operated stores and e-commerce in the United States, Europe and Canada. This segment represented 8.3% of total net sales in fiscal 2017.

Other, which is not a reportable segment, consists of Coach brand sales and expenses generated in other ancillary channels, licensing and disposition, and represented 1.2% of total net sales in fiscal 2017.
Coach Brand North America Segment
North America Retail Stores — Coach retail stores are located in both regional shopping centers and metropolitan areas throughout the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. The retail stores carry an assortment of products depending on their size, location and customer preferences. Our flagship stores, which offer the fullest expression of the Coach brand, are located in high-visibility locations.

In fiscal 2017, we have reduced the number of retail stores with a modest increase in total square footage, as we continue to optimize our real estate position. We expect to close approximately 10 North America retail stores in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. Furthermore, we expect to continue investing in the elevation of our existing store environments.
The change in the number of North America Coach retail stores and their total and average square footage is shown in the following table:

 | Fiscal Year Ended
 | July 1, 2017 | | July 2, 2016 | | June 27, 2015
Retail stores | 221 | | | 228 | | 258 |

% increase (decrease) vs. prior year | 0.8 | % | | (9.5 | )% | (19.9 | )%
Average square footage | 3,006 | | | 2,892 | | 2,825 | 

North America Outlet Stores — Coach brand's outlet stores serve as an efficient means to sell manufactured-for-outlet product, including outlet exclusives, and to a lesser extent, discontinued retail inventory outside the retail channel. These stores operate under the Coach brand name and are positioned in established outlet centers that are generally in close proximity to major markets and Coach branded retail locations.
Our outlet store design, visual presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce the brand's image. Through these outlet stores, we target value-oriented customers.
Over the next few years, we generally expect to see no significant growth in outlet store square footage as we continue to optimize our real estate position across channels by expanding our most productive stores to accommodate a broader expression of lifestyle assortment while continuing to assess opportunities to consolidate standalone Men's locations into core stores.
The change in the number of North America Coach outlet stores and their total and average square footage is shown in the following table:

 | Fiscal Year Ended
 | July 1, 2017 | | July 2, 2016 | | June 27, 2015

Net decrease vs. prior year | (6 | ) | | — | | (3 | ) 
% decrease vs. prior year | (2.9 | )% | | — | % | (1.4 | )%

Average square footage | 6,161 | | | 6,043 | | 5,829 | 

Internet — We view our www.coach.com website as a key communications vehicle for the brand to promote traffic in retail stores and department store locations and build brand awareness, as well as an additional channel to sell Coach brand products directly to customers. With approximately 59 million unique visits to www.coach.com in fiscal 2017, our online store provides a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a selected offering of the latest styles and colors. Our e-commerce programs also include our invitation-only outlet Internet sales site, where we have considerably reduced the number of promotional events since fiscal 2015.
North America Wholesale — The Coach brand began as a U.S. wholesaler to department stores and this channel continues to remain a part of our overall consumer reach. Today, we work closely with our partners to ensure a clear and consistent product presentation. We enhance our presentation through the creation of shop-in-shops with proprietary Coach brand fixtures within the department store environment. We custom tailor our assortments through wholesale product planning and allocation processes to match the attributes of our department store consumers in each local market. We continue to closely manage inventories in this channel given the current highly promotional environment at point-of-sale. We utilize automatic replenishment with major accounts in an effort to optimize inventory levels across wholesale doors.

As of July 1, 2017, Coach brand's products are sold in approximately 750 wholesale locations in the U.S. and Canada. Our wholesale partnerships include national and regional department stores including Macy's (including Bloomingdale's), Dillard's, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, The Bay, Saks 5th Ave, Bon Ton, Belk, Von Maur and Neiman Marcus. Coach products are also available on these customers' websites.
As of July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, we did not have any customers who individually accounted for more than 10% of the North America segment's total net sales.
Coach Brand International Segment
Our International Markets operate department store concession shop-in-shop locations and freestanding flagship, retail and outlet stores as well as e-commerce websites. Flagship stores, which offer the fullest expression of the Coach brand, are located in select high-visibility shopping districts.
We expect our International segment to reflect modest growth in store count over the next few years, particularly within mainland China and Europe. 
The following table shows the number of international directly-operated locations and their total and average square footage:

 | Fiscal Year Ended
 | July 1, 2017 | | July 2, 2016 | | June 27, 2015
Coach International: | | | | | 
Locations: | 543 | | | 522 | | 503 |

% increase vs. prior year | 7.4 | % | | 5.4 | % | 12.2 | %
Average square footage | 2,149 | | | 2,081 | | 2,049 | 

International Wholesale — Our international segment also includes sales to international wholesale distributors, authorized retailers and department stores throughout Europe and Japan. Travel retail represents the largest portion of our sales in this channel. However, we continue to drive growth by expanding our distribution to reach local consumers in new markets. Coach has developed relationships with a select group of distributors who sell Coach products through department stores and freestanding retail locations. Coach's current network of international distributors serve the following markets: Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Greater China, Colombia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, U.S. & Territories, Venezuela and Vietnam.
For locations not in freestanding stores, the Coach brand has created shop-in-shops and other image enhancing environments to increase brand appeal and stimulate growth. We will continue to seek opportunities for productivity improvements in this channel by opening larger image-enhancing locations, expanding existing stores and closing less productive stores. Coach's most significant international wholesale customers are the DFS Group, True Alliance, Al Tayer Insignia and Lotte Group. Coach's products are sold in approximately 800 international wholesale locations.
As of July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, we did not have any customers who individually accounted for more than 10% of the International segment's total net sales.
Stuart Weitzman Segment
The Stuart Weitzman brand is sold primarily through approximately 675 North America and international wholesale locations, as well as numerous independent third party distributors. Its most significant distributor and wholesale customers include Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Saks, Neiman Marcus and Beijing Goodwill Trading Co. Furthermore, Stuart Weitzman products are also sold in freestanding flagship and retail stores in North America and Europe, and e-commerce websites.

As of July 1, 2017, we did not have any customers who individually accounted for more than 10% of the Stuart Weitzman segment's total net sales.
See Note 15, "Segment Information", for more information about the Company's segments.
Other
Other, which is not a reportable segment, consists of sales generated by the Coach brand in other ancillary channels, licensing and disposition.
Licensing — In our worldwide licensing relationships, Coach takes an active role in the design process and controls the marketing and distribution of products under the Coach brand. Licensing revenue was $40.4 million and $29.7 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Our key licensing relationships as of July 1, 2017 are as follows:

 | | Date 
Category | Partner | Introduction | Expiration
Eyewear | Luxottica | 2012 | 2020 
Watches | Movado | 1998 | 2020 
Fragrance | Interparfums | 2015 | 2026 

Products made under license are, in most cases, sold through all of the channels discussed above and, with the Company's approval, these licensees have the right to distribute products selectively through several other venues. These venues provide additional, yet controlled, exposure of our brands. Our licensing partners pay royalties on their net sales of our branded products. Such royalties currently comprise less than 1% of the Coach brand's total net sales. The licensing agreements generally give Coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved.
Upon the expiration of the footwear license in June 2017, the Company brought all of the Coach brand women's footwear business in-house.

DESIGN AND MERCHANDISING
Coach brand's design team, led by the Executive Creative Director, Stuart Vevers, and Stuart Weitzman brand's design team, led by Giovanni Morelli, are responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of all products. Designers have access to the Company's extensive archives of product designs created since each brand's inception, which are a valuable resource for new product concepts. Our designers are also supported by a strong merchandising team that analyzes sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify market opportunities that help guide each season's design process and create a globally relevant product assortment. Merchandisers also manage the product life cycle to maximize sales and profitability across all channels. The product category teams, each comprised of design, merchandising/product development and sourcing specialists help each brand execute design concepts that are consistent with the brand's strategic direction.
Our design and merchandising teams also work in close collaboration with all of our licensing partners to ensure that the licensed products are conceptualized and designed to address the intended market opportunity and convey the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brands.
MARKETING
Our global marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent, relevant and multi-layered message every time the consumer comes in contact with our brands through our communications and visual merchandising. Our image is created and executed by our creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams, as well as with outside creative agencies. We also have a sophisticated consumer and market research capability, which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends.
In conjunction with promoting a consistent global image, we use our extensive customer database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all distribution channels.
We engage in several consumer communication initiatives, including direct marketing activities and national, regional and local advertising. Total expenses attributable to the Company's marketing-related events in fiscal 2017 were $178.3 million, or approximately 4% of net sales, compared to $202.2 million in fiscal 2016, or approximately 5% of net sales. 
Our wide range of direct marketing activities include email contacts and catalogs targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred shopping venue. In addition to building brand awareness and driving online revenue, our websites serve as an effective brand communication vehicle by providing a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles and colors, which drives store traffic and enables the collection of customer data.
As part of our direct marketing strategy, we use databases primarily consisting of approximately 45 million consumers in North America, approximately 18 million consumers in Asia and approximately 1 million consumers in Europe. Email contacts and direct mail pieces are an important part of our communication and are sent to selected consumers to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness. Visitors to our e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Japan, mainland China, the United Kingdom and South Korea provide an opportunity to increase the size of these databases, as well as point of sale transactions globally, except where restricted. 
In fiscal 2017, Coach had informational websites in Mexico, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, France, Spain and Saudi Arabia, as well as a global informational website where customers from various other countries are directed. In addition, the Company utilizes and continues to explore digital technologies such as blogs and social media websites, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, WeChat and Sina Weibo, as a cost effective consumer communication opportunity to increase on-line and store sales, acquire new customers and build brand awareness.
The Coach brand and Stuart Weitzman brand also run national, regional and local marketing campaigns in support of major selling seasons. As a key pillar of the transformation plan, Coach brand has expanded its marketing initiatives to more clearly message the brand's unique modern luxury positioning, rooted in a 75 year history of authenticity and craftsmanship, augmented by Executive Creative Director Stuart Vevers's modern interpretation of American fashion. We plan to continue to support this strategy in the future through an increased presence in relevant fashion, media events and publications.
MANUFACTURING
Coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners with demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. Our manufacturers are located in many countries, including Vietnam, mainland China, the Philippines, India, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Hong Kong, Myanmar and the United States. Coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the best cost and to mitigate the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets. During fiscal 2017, the Coach brand had two vendors, both located in Vietnam, who individually provided over 10% of the brand's total units (or approximately 31% in the aggregate). During fiscal 2017, Stuart Weitzman had three vendors, all located in Spain, who individually provided over 10% of the brands total units (or approximately 42% in the aggregate).

Before partnering with a new vendor, the Company evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved facilities are conducted on a recurring basis. We believe that our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with the Company’s integrity standards.
These independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new, fashion oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. 
Our raw material suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensing partners, must achieve and maintain high quality standards, which are an integral part of our identity. One of our keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. We have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. Although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers, we maintain a strong level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials that are used in all of our products. Compliance with quality control standards is monitored through on-site quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities.
We maintain control of the supply chain process from design through manufacture. We are able to do this by maintaining sourcing management offices in Vietnam, China, Hong Kong the Philippines, Singapore and Spain that work closely with our independent manufacturers. This broad-based, global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities.
DISTRIBUTION
In North America, the Company operates an 850,000 square foot distribution and consumer service facility in Jacksonville, Florida for Coach brand products. This automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system. Coach's distribution center employees use handheld scanners to read product bar codes, which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders, track shipments, manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers. Coach brand products are primarily shipped to Coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers, and direct to consumers. 
Outside of North America, the Company has established regional distribution centers through third-parties in Shanghai, China and Oldenzaal, The Netherlands for Coach brand products. The Company also operates local distribution centers through third-parties in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore for Coach brand products.
The Company operates local distribution centers through third-parties in the United States, Canada and Spain for Stuart Weitzman brand products.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
The foundation of the Company's information systems is its Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system. Within the Coach brand, this integrated system supports finance and accounting, procurement, inventory control, sales and store replenishment. The system functions as a central repository for our transactional information. Complementing our current ERP system are several other solutions. The Company's data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a global platform for management reporting. The supply chain management systems support product development, procurement, inventory planning and reporting functions. 
Under the Coach brand, in North America, product fulfillment is facilitated by our automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system, while the unique requirements of our Internet business are supported by Coach’s order management and e-commerce systems. Internationally, the Coach brand selectively relies on the warehouse and distribution systems owned by the third-parties that operate our international distributions centers. Additionally, our point-of-sale systems supports all in-store transactions, distributes management reporting to each store, and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis. This daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment. 
Stuart Weitzman warehouse and distribution fulfillment is facilitated by the brand's warehouse management system in North America and Europe. Stuart Weitzman's retail point-of-sale system supports all in-store transactions, including daily management sales reporting, payroll, sales tax, and store inventory management.
As discussed further within Note 3, "Restructuring Activities," in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company announced a series of operational efficiency initiatives focused on creating an agile and scalable business model, including the replacing and updating our core technology platforms and the retirement of certain information systems. This project is a key area of focus and priority.

In addition, Coach owns several design patents and utility patents for its branded products. Coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. It also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the Coach hotline and business partners around the world.
The Company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them. 
SEASONALITY
The Company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. During the first fiscal quarter, we build inventory for the winter and holiday season. In the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season. 
Fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the Company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events.
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Most of Coach's imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. The Company is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business, however customs duties do represent a component of total product cost. To maximize opportunities, we operate complex supply chains through foreign trade zones, bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements. Additionally, the Company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide. As a result, the Company is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its cross-border activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of the Company’s products. The Company maintains an internal global trade and customs organization to help manage its import/export activity.
COMPETITION
The global premium men's and women's handbag, accessories and footwear categories are highly competitive. Coach, Inc. competes primarily with European and American luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers. Over the last several years these industries have grown, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. This increased competition drives interest in these brand loyal categories.
EMPLOYEES
As of July 1, 2017, Coach, Inc. employed approximately 14,400 globally, including both full and part time employees, but excluding seasonal and temporary employees. Of these employees, approximately 7,700 and 3,900 were full time and part time employees, respectively, in the global retail field. 
Coach believes that its relations with its employees are good, and has never encountered a strike or work stoppage.
