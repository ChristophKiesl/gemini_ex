ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

Aspen Group, Inc., or Aspen Group, owns 100% of Aspen University Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Aspen or Aspen University. All references to the Company, we, our and us refer to Aspen Group, unless the context otherwise indicates.

Description of Business

Aspen Group, Inc. (Aspen Group) is a post-secondary education company with an overarching vision of making higher education affordable again in America. To date, Aspen Groups sole operating subsidiary has been Aspen University, Inc., doing business as Aspen University. On May 18, 2017, Aspen Group announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire United States University (USU), a regionally accredited for-profit university based in San Diego, California for a total purchase price of $9 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), WASC Senior College and University Commission, and state regulatory and programmatic accreditation bodies. The earliest that Aspen Group would receive required regulatory approvals would be December 2017. 

The remainder of this management discussion will focus on Aspen University.

Founded in 1987, Aspen Universitys mission is to offer any motivated college-worthy student the opportunity to receive a high quality, responsibly priced distance-learning education for the purpose of achieving sustainable economic and social benefits for themselves and their families. Aspen is dedicated to providing the highest quality education experiences taught by top-tier professors - 54% of our adjunct professors hold doctorate degrees.

Because we believe higher education should be a catalyst to our students long-term economic success, we exert financial prudence by offering affordable tuition that is one of the greatest values in online higher education. In March 2014, Aspen University unveiled a monthly payment plan aimed at reversing the college-debt sentence plaguing working-class Americans. The monthly payment plan offers bachelors degree students (except RN to BSN) the opportunity to pay $250/month for 72 months ($18,000), nursing bachelors degree students (RN to BSN) $250/month for 39 months ($9,750), masters degree students $325/month for 36 months ($11,700) and doctoral students $375 per month for 72 months ($27,000), interest free, thereby giving students a monthly payment tuition option versus taking out a federal financial aid loan. 

Since the March 2014 monthly payment education announcement, 65% of courses are now paid for through monthly payment methods (based on courses started over the last 90 days). Aspen offers two monthly payment programs, a monthly payment plan described above in which students make payments every month over a fixed period (36, 39 or 72 months depending on the degree program), and a monthly installment plan in which students pay three monthly installments (day 1, day 31 and day 61 after the start of each course). As of April 30, 2017, Aspen has 3,060 students paying tuition through either of the monthly payment methods. Of those, 2,801 of those students are paying tuition through a monthly payment plan representing total contractual value of $26.5 million, which today equates to approximately $780,000 of monthly recurring tuition revenue.

Aspen offers certificate programs and associate, bachelors, masters and doctoral degree programs in a broad range of areas, including nursing, business, education, technology, and professional studies. In terms of student body growth during fiscal year 2017, Aspens active degree-seeking student body grew by 1,749 students or 60%, from 2,932 to 4,681 students.

One of the key differences between Aspen and other publicly-traded, exclusively online, for-profit universities is the fact that the majority of our degree-seeking students (72% as of April 30, 2017 compared to 54% as of April 30, 2016) were enrolled in Aspens School of Nursing. Aspens School of Nursing grew during fiscal year 2017 by 1,481 students or 79%, from 1,882 to 3,363 students, which represents 85% of Aspens student body growth.

On November 10, 2014, Aspen University announced that the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) had awarded accreditation to its Bachelor of Science in Nursing program (RN to BSN) through December 31, 2019. CCNE is officially recognized by the DOE and is a nongovernmental accrediting agency, which provides specialized accreditation for nursing programs by ensuring the quality and integrity of nursing education in preparing effective nurses.

Since 2008, Aspens Master of Science in Nursing Program has held CCNE accreditation. The Master of Science in Nursing program most recently underwent accreditation review by CCNE in March 2011. At that time, the programs accreditation was reaffirmed, with a new accreditation term to expire December 30, 2021. We currently offer a variety of nursing degrees including: Master of Science in Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing - Nursing Education, Master of Science in Nursing  Nursing Administration and Management, Master of Science in Nursing  Forensic Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing Public Health, Master of Science in Nursing  Informatics, and Bachelor of Science in Nursing.

Aspens School of Nursing is responsible for the vast majority of the new student enrollment and overall active student body growth. Specifically, Aspens School of Nursing is now on pace to grow on an annualized basis by approximately 1,500 Active Nursing students  net of student graduations and withdrawals (or ~125/month). Aspens BSN program accounts for 72% of that growth, as that program is on pace to increase on an annualized basis by approximately 1,080 students  net (or ~90/month).

Aspen University expects its total active degree-seeking student body to continue its rapid growth and reach approximately 7,000 students by the end of the fiscal year, April 30, 2018. Therefore, the university is on pace to increase its active student body by ~2,300 students on an annualized basis in fiscal year 2018 versus the previous pace of ~1,750 active students a year ago, an improvement of 30% year-over-year.

In addition to the specialized CCNE program
matic accreditation, since 1993 Aspen University has been accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC), a national institutional accrediting agency recognized by the 
U.S. Department of Education (DOE)
. Accreditation by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE is required for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in the federal programs of student financial assistance administered pursuant to Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (the Title IV Programs). On February 25, 2015, the DEAC informed Aspen University that it had renewed its accreditation for five years through January 2019. Aspen Universitys accreditation is further discussed in the Accreditation Section of this Form 10-K. 

Aspen University also maintains approvals from professional associations, such as its approval as a Global Charter Education Provider from the Project Management Institute (PMI), and as a Registered Education Provider (R.E.P.) of the PMI. The PMI recognizes select Aspen Project Management Courses as Professional Development Units. These courses help prepare individuals to sit for the Project Management Professional (PMP), certification examination. PMP certification is the project management professions most recognized and respected certification credential. Project management professionals may take the PMI approved Aspen courses to fulfill continuing education requirements for maintaining their PMP certification.

Similarly, in connection with our Bachelor and Master degrees in Psychology of Addiction and Counseling, the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, (NAADAC), has approved Aspen as an academic education provider. NAADAC-approved education providers offer training and education for those who are seeking to become certified, and those who want to maintain their certification, as alcohol and drug counselors. In connection with the approval process, NAADAC reviews all educational training programs for content applicability to state and national certification standards.

Aspen also is a participant in the 
Title IV Programs. At the federal level, the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (the HEA) and the regulations promulgated under the HEA by the DOE set forth numerous, complex standards that institutions must satisfy in order to participate in the Title IV Programs.
Competitive Strengths - We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

Exclusively Online Education - We have designed our courses and programs specifically for online delivery, and we recruit and train faculty exclusively for online instruction. We provide students the flexibility to study and interact at times that suits their schedules. We design our online sessions and materials to be interactive, dynamic and user friendly.
Debt Minimization - We are committed to offering among the lowest tuition rates in the sector, which to date has alleviated the need for a significant majority of our students to borrow money to fund Aspens tuition requirements. Aspens course-by-course tuition rates are $150/credit hour for degree-seeking undergraduate programs, $325/credit hour for all master programs and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program and $450/credit hour for all doctoral degree programs. These tuition rates are designed to allow students to pay their tuition through monthly payment plans, thereby having the opportunity to earn their degree debt free.

Commitment to Academic Excellence - We are committed to continuously improving our academic programs and services, as evidenced by the level of attention and resources we apply to instruction and educational support. We are committed to achieving high course completion and graduation rates compared to competitive distance learning, for-profit schools. Fifty-four percent of our adjunct faculty members hold a doctorate degree. One-on-one contact with our highly experienced faculty brings knowledge and great perspective to the learning experience. Faculty members are available by telephone and email to answer questions, discuss assignments and provide help and encouragement to our students. 
Highly Scalable and Profitable Business Model - We believe our online education model, our relatively low student acquisition costs, and our variable faculty cost model will enable us to expand our operating margins. As we increase student enrollments we are able to scale on a variable basis the number of adjunct faculty members after we reach certain enrollment metrics (not before). A single adjunct faculty member can work with as little as two students or as many as 30 at any given time.

One Student at a Time personal care - We are committed to providing our students with highly responsive and personal individualized support. Every student is assigned an Academic Advisor who becomes an advocate for the students success. Our one-on-one approach assures contact with faculty members when a student needs it and monitoring to keep them on course. Our administrative staff is readily available to answer any questions and works with a student from initial interest through the application process and enrollment, and most importantly while the student is pursuing a degree or studies. 

Admissions

In considering candidates for acceptance into any of our certificate or degree programs, we look for those who are serious about pursuing  or advancing in  a professional career, and who want to be both prepared and academically challenged in the process. We strive to maintain the highest standards of academic excellence, while maintaining a friendly learning environment designed for educational, personal and professional success. A desire to meet those standards is a prerequisite. Because our programs are designed for self-directed learners who know how to manage their time, successful students have a basic understanding of management principles and practices, as well as good writing and research skills. Admission to Aspen is based on thorough assessment of each applicants potential to complete successfully the program. 
Industry Overview 

The U.S. market for postsecondary education is a large, growing market. According to the most recent publication by the National Center for Education Statistics, (NCES), the number of postsecondary learners enrolled as of 2012-13 in U.S. institutions that participate in Title IV Programs was approximately 27.8 million (including both undergraduate and graduate students). This number is up from 21 million in the fall of 2010, and from 18.2 million in the fall of 2007. We believe the growth in postsecondary enrollment is a result of a number of factors, including the significant and measurable personal income premium that is attributable to postsecondary education, and an increase in demand by employers for professional and skilled workers. 
According to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data managed by the DOE, the number of students that took at least one online course in the most recent studies was about 5.5 million  roughly one-quarter of the total enrollment. Among those 5.5 million students, about 2.6 million were enrolled in fully online programs  the rest took some traditional courses, some online. Additionally, the share of graduate students enrolled in fully online programs was twice as high as the share of undergraduates  22 to 11 percent. 

Competition

There are more than 4,200 U.S. colleges and universities serving traditional college age students and adult students. Any reference to universities herein also includes colleges. Competition is highly fragmented and varies by geography, program offerings, delivery method, ownership, quality level, and selectivity of admissions. No one institution has a significant share of the total postsecondary market. While we compete in a sense with traditional brick and mortar universities, our primary competitors are with online universities. Our online university competitors that are publicly traded include: American Public Education, Inc. (Nasdaq: APEI), DeVry Inc. (NYSE: DV), Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (Nasdaq: LOPE), Capella Education Company (Nasdaq: CPLA), and Bridgepoint Education, Inc. (NYSE: BPI). American Public Education, Inc. and Capella Education Company are wholly online while the others are not. Based upon public information, Apollo Group, which includes University of Phoenix, is the market leader with University of Phoenix having degreed enrollments of 135,900 in November 2016 (based upon APOLs Form 10-Q filed on January 9, 2017 for the period ending November 30, 2016). As of April 30, 2017, Aspen had 4,681 active degree-seeking students enrolled, respectively. These competitors have substantially more financial and other resources.

The primary mission of most traditional accredited four-year universities is to serve full-time students and conduct research. Most online universities serve working adults. Aspen acknowledges the differences in the educational needs between working and full-time students at brick and mortar schools and provides programs and services that allow our students to earn their degrees without major disruption to their personal and professional lives.

We also compete with public and private degree-granting regionally and nationally accredited universities. An increasing number of universities enroll working students in addition to the traditional 18 to 24 year-old students, and we expect that these universities will continue to modify their existing programs to serve working learners more effectively, including by offering more distance learning programs. We believe that the primary factors on which we compete are the following:

·
 Active and relevant curriculum development that considers the needs of employers;
 ·
 The ability to provide flexible and convenient access to programs and classes;
 ·
 High-quality courses and services;
 ·
 Comprehensive student support services;
 ·
 Breadth of programs offered;
 ·
 The time necessary to earn a degree;
 ·
 Qualified and experienced faculty;
 ·
 Reputation of the institution and its programs;
 ·
 The variety of geographic locations of campuses;
 ·
 Regulatory approvals;
 ·
 Cost of the program;
 ·
 Name recognition; and
 ·
 Convenience.

Sales and Marketing

Following Mr. Michael Mathews becoming Aspens Chief Executive Officer in May 2011, Mr. Mathews and his team made significant changes to Aspens sales and marketing program, specifically spending a significant amount of time, money and resources on our proprietary Internet marketing program. What is unique about Aspens Internet marketing program is that we have no plans in the near future to utilize third-party online lead generation companies to attract prospective students. To our knowledge, most if not all for-profit online universities utilize multiple third-party online lead generation companies to obtain a meaningful percentage of their prospective student leads. Aspens executive officers have many years of expertise in the online lead generation and Internet advertising industry, which for the foreseeable future will allow Aspen to cost-effectively drive all prospective student leads internally. This is a competitive advantage for Aspen because third-party leads are typically unbranded and non-exclusive (lead generation firms typically sell prospective student leads to multiple universities), therefore the conversion rate for those leads tends to be appreciably lower than internally generated, Aspen branded, proprietary leads.
Employees

As of July 24, 2017, we had 138 full-time employees, and 133 adjunct professors, of which 54% are doctorally prepared. None of our employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.
Corporate History

Aspen Group was incorporated on February 23, 2010 in Florida as a home improvement company intending to develop products and sell them on a wholesale basis to home improvement retailers. In June 2011, Aspen Group changed its name to Elite Nutritional Brands, Inc. and terminated all operations. In February 2012, Aspen Group reincorporated in Delaware under the name Aspen Group, Inc.

Aspen University was incorporated on September 30, 2004 in Delaware. Its predecessor was a Delaware limited liability company organized in Delaware in 1999. On March 13, 2012, Aspen Group acquired Aspen in a transaction we refer to as the Reverse Merger.

Regulation

Students attending Aspen finance their education through a combination of individual resources, corporate reimbursement programs and federal student financial assistance funds available through Aspens participation in the Title IV Programs. The discussion which follows outlines the extensive regulations that affect our business. Complying with these regulations entails significant effort from our executives and other employees. Further, regulatory compliance is also expensive. Beyond the internal costs, compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements also involves engagement of outside regulatory professionals. 

For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, approximately 21% of our cash-basis revenues for eligible tuition and fees were derived from the Title IV Programs. To participate in Title IV Programs, a school must, among other things, be:

·
 Authorized to offer its programs of instruction by the applicable state education agencies in the states in which it is physically located (in our case, Colorado);
 ·
 Accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of the DOE; and
 ·
 Certified as an eligible institution by the DOE.

State Authorization

Based on regulations issued by the DOE in 2011, Title IV Program institutions, like ours, that offer postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by that state, must meet any state requirements to offer postsecondary education to students in that state. The institution must be able to document state approval for distance education if requested by the DOE. This regulation was considered a significant departure from the state authorization procedures followed by most, if not all, institutions before its enactment. On July 12, 2011, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the portion of the DOEs state authorization regulation that requires online education providers to obtain any required authorization from all states in which their students reside, finding that the DOE had failed to provide sufficient notice and opportunity to comment on the requirement. An appellate court affirmed that ruling on June 5, 2012 and therefore this regulation is currently invalid. 

However, on July 25, 2016, the DOE issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) concerning new regulations governing the requirements for state authorization for distance education. Similar to the 2011 Rules, the proposed regulations required institutions to meet all state requirements for legally offering distance education in any state in which they are offering distance education courses as a condition of institutional eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs. If an institution does not hold authorization in a state that requires it to do so, students in that state would not be eligible to receive Title IV Program funds for enrollment in distance education programs offered by the institution in the state. The NPRM also proposed that Title IV Program eligibility and funding be contingent upon an institution being able to demonstrate that it is subject to an adequate state student complaint procedure. To date, the DOE has not indicated which state complaint procedures, if any, it considers to be inadequate. In addition, the NPRM required institutions to make a significant number of consumer disclosures regarding their distance education programs including disclosures regarding licensure and certification requirements, state authorization, student complaints, adverse actions by state and accreditation agencies, and refund policies. On December 16, 2016, DOE issued the final rule related to this NPRM. Although the final rule is similar to what DOE proposed on July 25, 2016, it surprisingly provides that the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) would not satisfy the basic authorization requirements of the rule. SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. When the NPRM was released, there appeared to be broad consensus that the regulations would support the multi-state SARA arrangement as satisfying the requirement that institutions obtain authorization in each state where they are required to be authorized. However, the final rule effectively removes SARA from the definition of a State authorization reciprocity agreement for the purpose of complying with the new regulations. This is significant because we are an approved SARA institution. 

The rest of the final rule remains largely unchanged from the NPRM. As in the proposed rule, the final rule requires institutions to meet all state requirements for legally offering distance education in any state in which institutions are offering distance education courses, but only to the extent the state has any such requirements. Also, while the language of the rule appears to make state authorization for distance learning a condition of institutional eligibility in the Title IV Programs, the preamble to the final rule clarifies that failure to hold a required authorization in a state will only result in inability to disburse Title IV Program funds to eligible students who are enrolled in distance learning programs while present in that state, rather than institution-wide. In addition, a state may impose penalties on an institution for failure to comply with state requirements related to an institutions activities in a state, including the delivery of distance education to persons in that state.

Because we are subject to extensive regulations by the states in which we become authorized or licensed to operate, we must abide by state laws that typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and other operational matters. State laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the DOE. If we fail to comply with state licensing requirements, we may lose our state licensure or authorizations. Failure to comply with state requirements could result in Aspen losing its authorization from the Colorado Commission on Higher Education, a department of the Colorado Department of Higher Education, (CDHE), its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, or its ability to offer certain programs, any of which may force us to cease operations.

Additionally, Aspen is a Delaware corporation. Delaware law requires an institution to obtain approval from the Delaware Department of Education, or Delaware DOE, before it may incorporate with the power to confer degrees. In July 2012, Aspen received notice from the Delaware DOE that it is granted provisional approval status effective until June 30, 2015. On April 25, 2016, the Delaware DOE informed Aspen University it was granted full approval to operate with degree-granting authority in the State of Delaware until July 1, 2020. 

Accreditation

Aspen is accredited by the DEAC, an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE. Accreditation is a non-governmental system for evaluating educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, and financial stability. In the U.S., this recognition comes primarily through private voluntary associations that accredit institutions and programs. To be recognized by the DOE, accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions. Accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions and programs for accreditation, and publicly designate those institutions or programs that meet their criteria. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting agencies to determine whether such institutions maintain the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation.

Accreditation by the DEAC is important to the University for several reasons. Other institutions depend, in part, on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Accreditation also provides external recognition and status. Employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating an employment candidates credentials. Corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards. Moreover, institutional accreditation awarded from an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE is necessary for eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs. From time to time, DEAC adopts or makes changes to its policies, procedures and standards. If we fail to comply with any of DEACs requirements, our accreditation status and, therefore, our eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs could be at risk. On February 25, 2015, the DEAC informed Aspen University that it had renewed its accreditation for five years to January, 2019.

In addition to institutional accreditation, there are numerous specialized accrediting commissions that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction, many of which are in healthcare and professional fields. In our case, Aspens Master of Science in Nursing and Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs hold specialized accreditation from the CCNE. CCNE is officially recognized by DOE and provides specialized accreditation for nursing programs. In our case, accreditation of specific nursing programs by CCNE signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of that agency. If we fail to satisfy the standards of any of these specialized accrediting commissions, we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and prevent our students from seeking and obtaining appropriate licensure in their fields. 

State Education Licensure and Regulation

As an institution of higher education that grants degrees and certificates, we are required to be authorized by applicable state education authorities which exercise regulatory oversight of our institution. In addition, in order to participate in the Title IV Programs, we must be authorized by the applicable state education agencies.

We are an approved institutional participant in SARA. SARA is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state. SARA is overseen by a National Council (NCSARA) and administered by four regional education compacts. There is a yearly renewal for participating in NC-SARA and CO-SARA and institutions must agree to meet certain requirements to participate. Some states that do not participate in SARA impose regulatory requirements on out-of-state educational institutions operating within their boundaries, such as those having a physical facility or conducting certain academic activities within the state. We currently enroll students in 49 states. Although we are currently licensed, authorized, in-process, or exempt in all non-SARA jurisdictions in which we operate, if we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a state, or fail to obtain licenses or authorizations when required, we could lose our state license or authorization by that state or be subject to other sanctions, including restrictions on our activities in, and fines and penalties imposed by, that state, as well as fines, penalties, and sanctions imposed by DOE. While we do not believe that any of the states in which we are currently licensed or authorized, other than Colorado, are individually material to our operations, the loss of licensure or authorization in any state could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state, which could significantly reduce our enrollments.

Individual state laws establish standards in areas such as instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters, some of which are different than the standards prescribed by the Colorado Department of Higher Education. Laws in some states limit schools ability to offer educational programs and award degrees to residents of those states. Some states also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the DOE, and many require the posting of surety bonds. In non-SARA states, regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states, and can change frequently. Laws, regulations, or interpretations related to online education could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, negatively affect enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business.

Nature of Federal, State and Private Financial Support for Postsecondary Education

The federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through the Title IV Programs, in the form of grants and loans to students. Students can use those funds at any institution that has been certified by the DOE to participate in the Title IV Programs. Aid under Title IV Programs is primarily awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute to that cost. All recipients of Title IV Program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study. In addition, each school must ensure that Title IV Program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students.

Aspens mission is to offer students the opportunity to fund their education without relying on student loans. In March 2014, Aspen launched a $250 monthly payment plan for bachelor students and a $325 monthly payment plan for master students, and subsequently a $375 monthly payment plan for doctoral students. Since initiation of this mission, 65% of our courses are paid through monthly payment methods (based on courses started over the last 90 days).

When our students borrow from the federal government, they receive loans and grants to fund their education under the following Title IV Programs: (1) the Federal Direct Loan program, or Direct Loan and (2) the Federal Pell Grant program, or Pell. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, approximately 21% of our cash-basis revenues for eligible tuition and fees were derived from Title IV Programs. Therefore, the majority of Aspen students self-finance all or a portion of their education. Additionally, students may receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers. Eligible students can also access private loans through a number of different lenders for funding at current market interest rates.

Under the Direct Loan program, the DOE makes loans directly to students. The Direct Loan Program includes the Direct Subsidized Loan, the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, the Direct PLUS Loan (including loans to graduate and professional students), and the Direct Consolidation Loan. The Budget Control Act of 2011 signed into law in August 2011, eliminated Direct Subsidized Loans for graduate and professional students, as of July 1, 2012. The terms and conditions of subsidized loans originated prior to July 1, 2012 are unaffected by the law. 

For Pell grants, the DOE makes grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. To date, few Aspen students have received Pell Grants. Accordingly, the Pell Grant program currently is not material to Aspens cash revenues.

Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs

The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed through Title IV Programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs, and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for-profit institutions have prompted the DOE to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for-profit institutions of higher learning. Accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing compliance of institutions in connection with Title IV Program requirements. As a result, our institution is subject to extensive oversight and review. Because the DOE periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how the Title IV Program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. See the Risk Factors contained herein which disclose comprehensive regulatory risks.

In addition to the state authorization requirements and other regulatory requirements described herein, other significant factors relating to Title IV Programs that could adversely affect us include the following legislative action and regulatory changes:

Congress reauthorizes the Higher Education Act approximately every five to eight years. Congress most recently reauthorized the Higher Education Act in August 2008. We cannot predict with certainty whether or when Congress might act to amend further the Higher Education Act. The elimination of additional Title IV Programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different programs could increase our costs of compliance and could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institution.

Administrative Capability. DOE regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV Programs. Failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead the DOE to find the institution ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs or to place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its participation. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things:

·
 Comply with all applicable Title IV Program regulations;
 ·
 Have capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student financial aid programs;
 ·
 Have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;
 ·
 Have cohort default rates above specified levels;
 ·
 Have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds;
 ·
 Not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;
 ·
 Provide financial aid counseling to its students;
 ·
 Refer to the DOEs Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee, or agent of the institution, has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV Programs;
 ·
 Report annually to the Secretary of Education on any reasonable reimbursements paid or provided by a private education lender or group of lenders to any employee who is employed in the institutions financial aid office or who otherwise has responsibilities with respect to education loans;
 ·
 Develop and apply an adequate system to identify and resolve conflicting information with respect to a students application for Title IV aid;
 ·
 Submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations; and
 ·
 Not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.

The DOE regulations also add an administrative capability standard related to the existing requirement that students must have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent in order to be eligible for Title IV Program aid. Under the administrative capability standard, institutions must develop and follow procedures for evaluating the validity of a students high school diploma if the institution or the Secretary of Education has reason to believe that the students diploma is not valid.

If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or any other DOE regulation, the DOE may:

·
 Require the repayment of Title IV Program funds;
 ·
 Transfer the institution from the advance system of payment of Title IV Program funds to cash monitoring status or to the reimbursement system of payment;
 ·
 Place the institution on provisional certification status; or
 
9


·
 Commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV Programs.

If we are found not to have satisfied the DOEs administrative capability requirements, we could lose, or be limited in our access to, Title IV Program funding.

Distance Education. We offer all of our existing degree and certificate programs via Internet-based telecommunications from our headquarters in Colorado. Under the Higher Education Opportunity Act, or HEOA, an accreditor that evaluates institutions offering distance education must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. 

On December 16, 2016, DOE issued a final rule that requires institutions to meet all state requirements for legally offering distance education in any state in which the institution is offering distance education courses. The rule will be effective on July 1, 2018. 

Financial Responsibility. The Higher Education Act and DOE regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as Aspen must satisfy to participate in the Title IV Programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the resources necessary to comply with Title IV Program requirements and meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds and any repayments to the DOE for liabilities incurred in programs administered by the DOE.

The DOE evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards that include a complex formula that uses line items from the institutions audited financial statements. In addition, the financial responsibility standards require an institution to receive an unqualified opinion from its accountants on its audited financial statements, maintain sufficient cash reserves to satisfy refund requirements, meet all of its financial obligations, and remain current on its debt payments. The formula focuses on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institutions capital resources, financial viability, and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institutions viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institutions profitability or ability to operate within its means). An institutions financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further federal oversight. The DOE may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution. 

For fiscal year 2014 (ending April 30, 2014), Aspen did not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the minimum composite score of 1.5. Consequently, in order for Aspen to continue to participate in the Title IV Programs, we were required to choose one of two alternatives. The first alternative was to qualify as a financially responsible institution by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the DOE in the amount of $2,244,971, which represented 50% of the Title IV Program funds received by the institution during the most recently completed fiscal year. The second alternative was to post a letter of credit in the amount of $1,122,485 and be provisionally certified for a period of up to three complete award years. That amount represented 25% of the Title IV Program funds received by the institution during the most recently completed fiscal year. Aspen selected the second alternative and posted the required letter of credit in the amount of $1,122,485 on April 29, 2015. In November of 2015, the DOE informed Aspen that it no longer needed to maintain a letter of credit based on the institutions fiscal year 2015 results and released the letter of credit. As a part of the April 29, 2015 decision, Aspen is currently subject to Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 (HCM1) status, which requires the institution to first make disbursements of Title IV Program funds to eligible students and parents before it requests or receives funds for the amount of those disbursements from the DOE. In addition, Aspen continues to be provisionally certified. A provisionally certified institution, such as Aspen, must apply for and receive DOE approval of substantial changes and must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement, which is Aspens agreement with the DOE. If the DOE determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, the DOE may seek to revoke the institution's certification to participate in Title IV Programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified.

Although Aspen believes it will meet the minimum composite score necessary to meet the Financial Ratio standard for fiscal year 2017, the DOE may determine that Aspens calculation is incorrect, and/or it may determine that Aspen continues to not meet other financial responsibility standards. If the DOE were to determine that we do not meet its financial responsibility standards, we may be able to continue to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis. Alternative bases include, for example:

·
 Posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 50% of the total Title IV Program funds received by us during our most recently completed fiscal year;
 ·
 Posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of such prior years Title IV Program funds received by us, accepting provisional certification, complying with additional DOE monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than the DOEs standard advance payment arrangement such as the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring; or
 ·
 Complying with additional DOE monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than the DOEs standard advance payment arrangement such as the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring.

Failure to meet the DOEs financial responsibility requirements, either because we do not meet the DOEs financial responsibility standards or are unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, would cause us to lose access to Title IV Program funding.

Third-Party Servicers. DOE regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institutions participation in Title IV Programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV Program requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary of Education for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV Program provision. An institution must report to the DOE new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers as well as other matters related to third-party servicers. We contract with a third-party servicer which performs certain activities related to our participation in Title IV Programs. If our third-party servicer does not comply with applicable statutes and regulations including the Higher Education Act, we may be liable for its actions, and we could lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.

Return of Title IV Program Funds. Under the DOEs return of funds regulations, when a student withdraws, an institution must return unearned funds to the DOE in a timely manner. An institution must first determine the amount of Title IV Program funds that a student earned. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV Program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV Program funds. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV Programs, in a specified order, the lesser of (i) the unearned Title IV Program funds and (ii) the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV Program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date of the institutions determination that a student withdrew. If such payments are not timely made, an institution may be subject to adverse action, including being required to submit a letter of credit equal to 25% of the refunds the institution should have made in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under DOE regulations, late returns of Title IV Program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institutions annual compliance audit constitutes material non-compliance with the Title IV Program requirements. 
The 90/10 Rule. A requirement of the Higher Education Act commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, applies only to proprietary institutions of higher education, which includes Aspen. An institution is subject to loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs if it derives more than 90% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis and in accordance with a DOE formula) from Title IV Programs for two consecutive fiscal years. An institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years and may be subject to other conditions specified by the Secretary of the DOE. For Aspens most recent fiscal year ending April 30, 2017, approximately 21% of our revenue was derived from Title IV Programs.

Student Loan Defaults. Under the Higher Education Act, an education institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV Programs if defaults on the repayment of Direct Loan Program loans by its students exceed certain levels. For each federal fiscal year, a rate of student defaults (known as a cohort default rate) is calculated for each institution with 30 or more borrowers entering repayment in a given federal fiscal year by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year default by the end of the following two federal fiscal years. For such institutions, the DOE calculates a single cohort default rate for each federal fiscal year that includes in the cohort all current or former student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any Direct Loan Program loans during that year.

If the DOE notifies an institution that its cohort default rates for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years are 30% or greater, the institutions participation in the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program ends 30 days after the notification, unless the institution appeals in a timely manner to that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures. In addition, an institutions participation in Title IV ends 30 days after notification that its most recent fiscal year cohort default rate is greater than 40%, unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures. An institution whose participation ends under these provisions may not participate in the relevant programs for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the institution receives the notification, as well as for the next two fiscal years.

If an institutions cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25% in any single year, the institution may be placed on provisional certification status. Provisional certification does not limit an institutions access to Title IV Program funds; however, an institution with provisional status is subject to closer review by the DOE and may be subject to summary adverse action if it violates Title IV Program requirements. If an institutions default rate exceeds 40% for one federal fiscal year, the institution may lose eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs. Aspens official cohort default rates 2011, 2012 and 2013 are 3%, 12.5% and 6.4%, respectively.

Incentive Compensation Rules. As a part of an institutions program participation agreement with the DOE and in accordance with the Higher Education Act, an institution may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. Failure to comply with the incentive payment rule could result in termination of participation in Title IV Programs, limitation on participation in Title IV Programs, or financial penalties. Aspen believes it is in compliance with the incentive payment rule.

In recent years, other postsecondary educational institutions have been named as defendants to whistleblower lawsuits, known as qui tam cases, brought by current or former employees pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that their institutions compensation practices did not comply with the incentive compensation rule. A qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals, referred to as a relator, on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment. The relator, often a current or former employee, is entitled to a share of the governments recovery in the case, including the possibility of treble damages. A qui tam action is always filed under seal and remains under seal until the government decides whether to intervene in the case. If the government intervenes, it takes over primary control of the litigation. If the government declines to intervene in the case, the relator may nonetheless elect to continue to pursue the litigation at his or her own expense on behalf of the government. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert managements time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit.

The GAO released a report finding that the DOE has inadequately enforced the current ban on incentive payments. In response, the DOE has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts by, among other approaches, strengthening procedures provided to auditors reviewing institutions for compliance with the incentive payments ban and updating its internal compliance guidance in light of the GAO findings and the DOE incentive payment rule.


12


Code of Conduct Related to Student Loans. As part of an institutions program participation agreement with the DOE, HEOA requires that institutions that participate in Title IV Programs adopt a code of conduct pertinent to student loans. For financial aid office or other employees who have responsibility related to education loans, the code must forbid, with limited exceptions, gifts, consulting arrangements with lenders, and advisory board compensation other than reasonable expense reimbursement. The code also must ban revenue-sharing arrangements, opportunity pools that lenders offer in exchange for certain promises, and staffing assistance from lenders. The institution must post the code prominently on its website and ensure that its officers, employees, and agents who have financial aid responsibilities are informed annually of the codes provisions. Aspen has adopted a code of conduct under the HEOA which is posted on its website. In addition to the code of conduct requirements that apply to institutions, HEOA contains provisions that apply to private lenders, prohibiting such lenders from engaging in certain activities as they interact with institutions. Failure to comply with the code of conduct provision could result in termination of our participation in Title IV Programs, limitations on participation in Title IV Programs, or financial penalties. 
Misrepresentation. The Higher Education Act and current regulations authorize the DOE to take action against an institution that participates in Title IV Programs for any substantial misrepresentation made by that institution regarding the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. Effective July 1, 2011, DOE regulations expanded the definition of substantial misrepresentation to cover additional representatives of the institution and additional substantive areas and expands the parties to whom a substantial misrepresentation cannot be made. The regulations also augment the actions the DOE may take if it determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation. Under the final regulations, the DOE may revoke an institutions program participation agreement, impose limitations on an institutions participation in Title IV Programs, or initiate proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the institutions participation in Title IV Programs.
Credit Hours. The Higher Education Act and current regulations use the term credit hour to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of Title IV Program aid an institution may disburse during a payment period. Recently, both Congress and the DOE have increased their focus on institutions policies for awarding credit hours. DOE regulations define the term credit hour in terms of a certain amount of time in class and outside class, or an equivalent amount of work. The regulations also require accrediting agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institutions credit hour assignments. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institutions programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. If the DOE determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, the DOE could require the institution to repay the incorrectly awarded amounts of Title IV Program aid. In addition, if the DOE determines that an institution has significantly overstated the amount of credit hours assigned to a program, the DOE may fine the institution, or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in the Title IV Programs.
Compliance Reviews. We are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the DOE, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, and accrediting agencies. As part of the DOEs ongoing monitoring of institutions administration of Title IV Programs, the Higher Education Act and DOE regulations require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable audit standards of the DOE. These auditing standards differ from those followed in the audit of our financial statements contained herein. In addition, to enable the DOE to make a determination of financial responsibility, institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with DOE regulations. Furthermore, the DOE regularly conducts program reviews of education institutions that are participating in the Title IV Programs, and the Office of Inspector General of the DOE regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions. In August 2010, the Secretary of Education announced in a letter to several members of Congress that, in part in response to recent allegations against proprietary institutions of deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with DOE regulations, the DOE planned to strengthen its oversight of Title IV Programs through, among other approaches, increasing the number of program reviews.
Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations. If we fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV Programs, the DOE could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring Aspen to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV Program funds, requiring Aspen to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against us, referring the matter for criminal prosecution or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend or terminate our participation in Title IV Programs. 

We also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public.
 
13


Restrictions on Adding Educational Programs. State requirements and accrediting agency standards may, in certain instances, limit our ability to establish additional educational programs. Many states require approval before institutions can add new programs under specified conditions. The Colorado Commission on Higher Education, and other state educational regulatory agencies that license or authorize us and our programs, may require institutions to notify them in advance of implementing new programs, and upon notification may undertake a review of the institutions licensure or authorization.

In addition, we were advised by the DOE that because we were provisionally certified due to being a new Title IV Program participant, we could not add new degree or non-degree programs for Title IV Program purposes, except under limited circumstances and only if the DOE approved such new program, until the DOE reviewed a compliance audit that covered one complete fiscal year of Title IV Program participation. That fiscal year ended on December 31, 2010, and we timely submitted our compliance audit and financial statements to the DOE. In addition, in June 2011, Aspen timely applied for recertification to participate in Title IV Programs. The DOE extended Aspen's provisional certification until September 30, 2013. Aspen re-applied as of June 30, 2013 to continue its participation in the Title IV HEA programs. On February 9, 2015, the DOE notified Aspen that it had the choice of posting a letter of credit for 25% of all Title IV Program funds and remain provisionally certified or post a 50% letter of credit and become fully certified. We elected to post a 25% letter of credit and remain provisionally certified  increasing our letter of credit to $1,122,485. In November of 2015, the DOE informed Aspen that it no longer needed to post a letter of credit and released the posted letter of credit. In the future, the DOE may impose additional or different terms and conditions in any program participation agreement that it may issue, including growth restrictions or limitation on the number of students who may receive Title IV Program aid.

DOE regulations regarding Gainful Employment programs also require all institutions to notify the Department of Education when establishing new programs by updating the program list on the institutions Eligibility and Certification Approval Report. The institution must also provide certifications to the Department of Education signed by a senior administrative official attesting that the new program meets certain accreditation and state licensure requirements.

DEAC requires pre-approval of new courses, programs, and degrees that are characterized as a substantive change. An institution must obtain written notice approving such change before it may be included in the institutions grant of accreditation. An institution is further prohibited from advertising or posting on its website information about the course or program before it has received approval. The process for obtaining approval generally requires submission of a report and course materials and may require a follow-up on-site visit by an examining committee.

Gainful Employment. Under the Higher Education Act, only proprietary school programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation are eligible to participate in Title IV Program funding. The DOEs Gainful Employment (GE) regulations define the requirements that programs at proprietary institutions must meet in order to be considered a GE program that is eligible for Title IV Program funding. After an earlier version of the GE Rules was vacated by a federal court in July 2012, the DOE initiated a new negotiated rulemaking process in 2013. The negotiators failed to reach consensus in establishing new GE Rules, and the DOE published a new proposed GE rule in March 2014 for public comment. The final GE regulations were published on October 31, 2014 and went into effect on July 1, 2015. Under the regulations, all GE programs must meet certain metrics regarding their graduates debt-to-earnings (D/E) ratios to maintain Title IV Program eligibility. Specifically, the 2015 regulations include two debt-to-earnings metrics. 

·
 Debt-to-annual earnings (aDTE) metric which compares the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt incurred by students receiving Title IV program funds who completed that particular program to the higher of the mean or median of those graduates annual earnings approximately two to four years after they graduate; and
 ·
 Debt-to-discretionary income (dDTI) metric which compares the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt incurred by students receiving Title IV Program funds who completed a particular program to the higher of the mean or median of those graduates discretionary income approximately two to four years after they graduate.

A program must achieve an aDTE rate at or below 8%, or a dDTI rate at or below 20%, to pass the D/E metrics. A program that does not have a passing rate under either the aDTE or dDTI rates, but has an aDTE rate greater than 8% but less than or equal to 12%, or a dDTI rate greater than 20% but less than or equal to 30%, is considered in the zone. A program with an aDTE rate greater than 12% and a dDTI rate greater than 30%, is failing the D/E metrics. A program loses Title IV eligibility for three years, if its aDTE rate and dDTI rate are failing in two out of any three consecutive award years or both of those rates are either failing or in the zone for four consecutive award years for which the ED calculates D/E Rates. When a program loses Title IV eligibility, institutions are also restricted from establishing substantially similar programs for three years. Programs are substantially similar based on having a classification of instructional program (CIP) code that has the same first four credits. 
 
14


If the DOE notifies an institution that a program could become ineligible based on its final D/E rates for the next award year:

·
 The institution must provide a warning with respect to the program to students and prospective students indicating that students may not be able to use Title IV funds to attend or continue in the program; and
 ·
 The institution must not enroll, register or enter into a financial commitment with a prospective student until a specified time after providing the warning to the prospective student.

However, an institution that timely filed a Notice of Intent to submit an alternate earnings appeal is not required to issue the student warnings until after the DOE has reviewed the appeal and issued a final rates determination. The earnings appeal element of the rule was intended to become effective immediately following the issuance of rates in January 2017, but was delayed once in March, and again in June, 2017. On June 30th, the DOE issued a Notice in the Federal Register indicating that it would delay the July 1st deadline for submitting an alternate earnings appeal until new processes are established for those appeals. The DOE stated that it would provide additional guidance within 30 days. In the meantime, programs that filed an intent to appeal are not required to issue the student warnings and were granted additional time to complete the appeals process.

The GE Regulations also include certain disclosure requirements, which were scheduled to become effective on January 1st, 2017. The GE Rules disclosure provisions require institution to provide disclosures to students on their websites about each of their GE programs using a template developed by the DOE for this purpose. Each GE programs disclosure must include information such as the occupations that the program prepares students to enter, total program cost, on-time completion rate, job placement rate (if the institution is required to calculate the rate by their state or accreditation agency), and median loan debt of students who complete the program, among other items. The new disclosure template was published in January 2017, but the deadline for publishing the templates was extended until July 1st. However, in conjunction with the delay issued on June 30th, the requirement to issue the disclosure template was also delayed, in part. The disclosure requirement consists of three forms of disclosure: 1) inclusion of the template, or a prominent link to the template, on any web page containing academic, cost, financial aid, or admissions information about a GE program maintained by or on behalf of an institution; 2) inclusion of the template, or a prominent link to it, in all GE program promotional materials; and 3) personalized delivery (whether in person or by email) to any prospective student prior to signing an enrollment agreement with an institution. While the June 30th notice delayed the latter two requirements until July 1, 2018, the requirement to post the template or link on the institutions webpage became effective on July 1st. Aspen has published the disclosure templates on the required webpages, prior to the July 1 deadline.

Further, institutions are required to annually report student and program level data to the DOE for each Title IV student enrolled in a GE program. The deadlines to report GE data thus far were in July and October 2015 and October 2016. Annual reporting is scheduled for October 1st, and as of now, the DOE has not indicated any planned delay to the 2017 reporting deadline. We have reported all required student data by these submission deadlines. 

By December 31, 2015, institutions were required to certify that eligible GE programs are programmatically accredited if required by a federal governmental entity or a state governmental entity of a state in which it is located or is otherwise required to obtain state approval, and that each eligible program satisfies the applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure or certification requirements in each state in which it is located or is otherwise required to obtain state approval, so that a student who completes the program and seeks employment in that state qualifies to take any licensure or certification exam that is needed for the student to practice or find employment in an occupation that the program prepares students to enter. We submitted these certifications in a timely manner. As discussed previously, the DOE requires institutions to update these certifications regarding any new programs they wish to add as well. 

The new GE requirements will likely substantially increase our administrative burdens, particularly during the implementation phase. These reporting and the other procedural changes in the new rules could affect student enrollment, persistence and retention in ways that we cannot now predict. For example, if our reported program information compares unfavorably with other reporting education institutions, it could adversely affect demand for our programs.


15


Although the rules regarding GE metrics provide opportunities to address program deficiencies before the loss of Title IV eligibility, the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for Title IV funding is at risk because the D/E rates are impacted by numerous factors outside of our control. Changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, etc. are all factors that could impact our D/E rates. In addition, even though we may be able to improve our D/E rates before losing Title IV eligibility for a GE program, the warning requirements to students following a failure to meet the standards may adversely impact enrollment in that program and may adversely impact the reputation of our education institution. The exposure to these external factors may reduce our ability to offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is market demand, thus affecting our ability to maintain or grow our business.

At this time, the long term impact of the GE Rule is still unclear, as the Department issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on June 16th, announcing their intent to empanel a new negotiating committee to examine and rewrite the GE (and Borrower Defense to Repayment) rules. It is likely that this rulemaking will change the GE Rule, but the impact of those changes would not be apparent until after July 2019, at the earliest. In the meantime, ED has not indicated its intent to further delay any other elements of the Rule while the rulemaking is underway. If ED continues on its current path, programs that failed the first set of debt-to-earnings rates could lose eligibility in the coming year. 

Eligibility and Certification Procedures. Each institution must periodically apply to the DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs. Such recertification is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change of control. An institution may come under the DOEs review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new program, or, in certain cases, when it modifies academic credentials that it offers.

The DOE may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when it undergoes a change in ownership and control. The DOE may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school or make any other significant change.

In addition, during the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement. If the DOE determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institutions certification to participate in Title IV Programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. Students attending provisionally certified institutions, like Aspen, remain eligible to receive Title IV Program funds.

Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDTR). The DOEs current regulations provide borrowers of loans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (FDL) program a defense against an attempt to collect such loans based on any act or omission of the institution that would give rise to a cause of action under the applicable state law. In the event the borrowers defense against repayment is successful, the DOE has the authority to discharge all or part of the students obligation to repay the loan, and may require the institution to repay the amount of the loan to which the defense applies. In October 2015, the DOE announced its intent to appoint a negotiated rulemaking committee to address borrower defense to repayment and related issues. The negotiated rulemaking committee did not reach consensus on proposed regulations, resulting in DOE having the authority to draft proposed regulations in its sole discretion. The DOE published proposed regulations in the Federal Register on June 16, 2016, and stated that it would accept comments from the public on the proposed regulations through August 1, 2016. In accordance with the rulemaking calendar specified in the HEA, DOE would have to publish any final regulation by November 1, 2016, in order for such regulation to become effective July 1, 2017, the earliest date that new regulations could take effect. DOE met the deadline, issuing the final BDTR rule on November 1st, 2016 for a July 1, 2017 effective date. 

The BDTR regulations opened new avenues for student borrowers to assert a defense to repaying their loans, allow DOE to seek reimbursement for such claims from the affected institutions, and expand DOEs financial responsibility rules to require many more schools to post letters of credit with the DOE. The proposed regulations include, among other things: (1) Bases for borrowers to file claims including a favorable decision for the student in a state or federal court involving the loan, a breach of contract by the institution, or a substantial misrepresentation by the institution about the nature of its educational program, the nature of its financial charges or the employability of its graduates; (2) the establishment by the DOE of a fact-finding process to resolve claims; (3) Provisions giving DOE the authority to initiate a proceeding to seek repayment from the institution for any loan amounts forgiven; (4) Amendments to DOEs financial responsibility regulations that describe new early warning triggers that would allow DOE to put an institution on provisional certification and require it to post a letter of credit with the DOE to demonstrate its financial stability; (5) New repayment rate calculations and warnings to students if the institution does not meet prescribed repayment rate metrics; and (6) provisions forbidding mandatory arbitration clauses and class action waivers.

The BDTR rule was scheduled to become effective on July 1, 2017, but as noted above, on June 16th, the DOE issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking expressing its intent to rewrite the BDTR rule. In conjunction with that Notice, DOE also indicated it was postponing implementation of the new BDTR rules until legal challenges to the rule are resolved, and to allow for a reset of the regulation through negotiated rulemaking. There was no new effective date proposed, so as of now, the rule has been delayed indefinitely. However, in response to these actions, the DOE is now being sued by a large group of Attorneys General, as well as a number of students. It is unclear if the Courts will intercede and force the Department to set a new implementation date. In the meantime, aggrieved borrowers are still able to seek a defense to repayment through the existing rule which has been effective since 1994. 

Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control. In addition to school acquisitions, other types of transactions can also cause a change of control. The DOE, most state education agencies, and DEAC all have standards pertaining to the change of control of schools, but those standards are not uniform. DOE regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change of control, including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institutions parent corporation. DOE regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly-traded corporation occurs in one of two ways: (i) if there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, disclosing a change of control or (ii) if the corporation has a shareholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest shareholder of the corporation, and that shareholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest shareholder. A significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the DOE to be a change of control under this standard. Many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control requiring approval. A change of control under the definition of one of these agencies would require us to seek approval of the change in ownership and control to maintain our accreditation, state authorization or licensure. The requirements to obtain such approval from the states and DETC vary widely. In some cases, approval of the change of ownership and control cannot be obtained until after the transaction has occurred. 

In connection with Aspen Groups acquisition of Aspen University, it provided notice to the regulators involved and received approval in due course with a number of conditions. Aspen University complied with all conditions although it remains provisionally certified.

When a change of ownership resulting in a change of control occurs at a for-profit institution, the DOE applies a different set of financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution in conjunction with its review and approval of the change of ownership. The institution generally is required to submit a same-day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution immediately following the change in ownership. The institutions same-day balance sheet must demonstrate an acid test ratio of at least 1:1, which is calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities (and excluding all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables). The same-day balance sheet must also demonstrate positive tangible net worth. If the institution does not satisfy these requirements, the DOE may condition its approval of the change of ownership on the institutions agreeing to post a letter of credit, provisional certification, and/or additional monitoring requirements, as described in the above section on Financial Responsibility. The time required for the DOE to act on a change in ownership and control application may vary substantially. As a result of the change of ownership, Aspen delivered a $264,665 letter of credit to the DOE in accordance with the standards identified above. Thereafter, as described above, this letter of credit was increased to $1,122,485. In November of 2015, the DOE informed Aspen that it no longer needed to post a letter of credit and released the existing letter of credit.

A change of control also could occur as a result of future transactions in which Aspen is involved. Some corporate reorganizations and some changes in the Board are examples of such transactions. Moreover, the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our shareholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could discourage bids for your shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares.

Possible Acquisitions. In addition to the planned expansion through Aspens new marketing program, we may expand through acquisition of related or synergistic businesses. Our internal growth is subject to monitoring and ultimately approval by the DEAC. If the DEAC finds that the growth may adversely affect our academic quality, the DEAC can request us to slow the growth and potentially withdraw accreditation and require us to re-apply for accreditation. The DOE may also impose growth restrictions on an institution, including in connection with a change in ownership and control.

Please note that on May 18, 2017, Aspen Group announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire USU, a regionally accredited for-profit university based in San Diego, California for a total purchase price of $9 million. USU offers graduate and undergraduate degrees in health sciences, business and nursing, as well as California Teaching Credentials. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals by the DOE, WASC Senior College and University Commission, and state regulatory and programmatic accreditation bodies. The earliest that Aspen Group would receive required regulatory approvals would be December 2017.
 
In March 2017, Aspen Group entered into a Marketing Consulting Agreement with USU whereby Aspen Group agreed to provide marketing consulting for their online programs. USU is required to pay Aspen for providing the consulting services under the Agreement. The term of the Marketing Agreement continues until December 31, 2017 unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Agreement.

On July 25, 2017, the Company signed a $10 million senior secured term loan with Runway Growth Credit Fund (formerly known as GSV Growth Credit Fund). The Company will draw $5 million under the facility at closing, with the remaining $5 million to be drawn following the closing of the Companys acquisition of substantially all the assets of the United States University, including receipt of all required regulatory approvals, among other conditions to funding. Terms of the 4-year senior loan include a 10% over 3-month LIBOR per annum interest rate. The Company also issued 224,174 5-year warrants at an exercise price of $6.87 per share.
