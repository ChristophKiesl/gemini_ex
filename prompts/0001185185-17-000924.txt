ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
 
Hooker Furniture Corporation, incorporated in Virginia in 1924, is a designer, marketer and importer of casegoods (wooden and metal furniture), leather furniture and fabric-upholstered furniture for the residential, hospitality and contract markets. We also domestically manufacture premium residential custom leather and custom fabric-upholstered furniture. We are ranked among the nation’s top five largest publicly traded furniture sources, based on 2015 shipments to U.S. retailers, according to a 2016 survey by a leading trade publication.
 
On February 1, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Home Meridian International, Inc. The Home Meridian acquisition (the “Acquisition”) gives us access to new customers and new channels of distribution. The Acquisition has more than doubled our net sales and has better positioned us in the fastest growing and emerging channels of distribution, including the e-commerce, warehouse membership clubs and contract channels of distribution. See Item 7 and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 
Operating Segments
 
Furniture sales account for all of our net sales. For financial reporting purposes, we are organized into four operating segments- Hooker casegoods, Upholstery, Home Meridian and All Other. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our segments.

Sourcing
 
Imported Products
 
We have sourced products from foreign manufacturers for nearly thirty years, predominantly from Asia. Imported casegoods and upholstered furniture together accounted for approximately 90% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 70% of net sales in fiscal 2016, and 71% of net sales in fiscal 2015.
 
Our imported furniture business is subject to inherent risks in importing products manufactured abroad, including, but not limited to, supply disruptions and delays, currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation-related issues, economic and political developments and instability, as well as the laws, policies and actions of foreign governments and the United States. These acts may include regulations affecting trade or the application of tariffs.
 
Because of the large number and diverse nature of the foreign suppliers from which we source our imported products, we have flexibility in the sourcing of products among any particular supplier or country. However, a disruption in our supply chain from a major supplier or from Vietnam or China in general, could significantly compromise our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country. We believe we could, most likely at higher cost, source most of the products currently sourced in Vietnam or China from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories.  However, supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to six months.  If we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at a comparable cost, then a disruption in our supply chain from a major furniture supplier, or from Vietnam or China in general, could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity.  Given the sourcing capacity available in Vietnam, China, and other low-cost producing countries, we believe the risks from these potential supply disruptions are manageable.
 
For imported products, we generally negotiate firm pricing with foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars, typically for a term of at least one year.  We accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods.  We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk, but could choose to do so in the future.  Since we transact our imported product purchases in U.S. Dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies from which we obtain our imported products could increase the price we pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods.  We generally expect to reflect substantially all of the effects of any price increases from suppliers in the prices we charge for imported products.  However, these price changes could adversely impact sales volume and profit margin during affected periods.  Conversely, a relative increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies from which we obtain our imported products could decrease the cost of imported products and favorably impact net sales and profit margins during affected periods. However, due to other factors, such as inflationary pressure in China and other countries, we may not fully realize savings when exchange rates fall. Therefore, lower exchange rates may only have a tempering effect on future price increases by merely delaying cost increases on imported products.  See also “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
 
Raw Materials
 
Significant materials used in manufacturing our domestic upholstered furniture products include leather, fabric, foam, wooden frames and metal mechanisms.  Most of the leather is imported from Italy, South America and China, and is purchased as full hides and cut and sewn in our facilities, or is purchased as pre-cut and sewn kits processed by our vendors to our pattern specifications. We believe that our sources for raw materials are adequate and that we are not dependent on any one supplier.  Our five largest domestic upholstery suppliers accounted for approximately 37% of our raw materials supply purchases for domestic upholstered furniture manufacturing operations in fiscal 2017. One supplier accounted for approximately 16% of our raw material purchases in fiscal 2017. Should disruptions with this supplier occur, we believe we could successfully source these products from other suppliers without significant disruption to our operations.
Customers
 
Our home furnishings products are sold through a variety of retailers including independent furniture stores, department stores, mass merchants, national chains, warehouse clubs, catalog merchants, interior designers and e-commerce retailers.  Sales to Costco Wholesale Corporation accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated sales in fiscal 2017. Our top five customers accounted for nearly one-third of our fiscal 2017 consolidated sales. The loss of any one or more of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our business.  Approximately 2.4% of our sales in fiscal 2017 were to international customers, which we define as sales outside of the United States and Canada.

Competition
 
The furniture industry is highly competitive and includes a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, none of which dominates the market in our price points.  While the markets in which we compete include a large number of relatively small and medium-sized manufacturers, certain competitors have substantially greater sales volumes and financial resources than we do.  U.S. imports of furniture produced overseas, such as from Vietnam and China, have stabilized in recent years. The primary competitive factors for home furnishings in our price points include price, style, availability, service, quality and durability.  Competitive factors in the hospitality and contract furniture markets include product value and utility, lead times, on-time delivery and the ability to respond to requests for special and non-standard products. We believe our design capabilities, ability to import and/or manufacture upholstered furniture, product value, longstanding customer and supplier relationships, significant sales, distribution and inventory capabilities, ease of ordering, financial strength, experienced management and customer support are significant competitive advantages.
Warehousing and Distribution
 
We distribute furniture to retailers directly from factories and warehouses in Asia via our container direct programs and from our distribution centers in Virginia, North Carolina and California. It is our policy and industry practice to allow order cancellation for casegoods up to the time of shipment; therefore, customer orders for casegoods are not firm.  However, domestically produced upholstered products are predominantly custom-built and consequently, cannot be cancelled once the leather or fabric has been cut. Additionally, our hospitality products are highly customized and are generally not cancellable.
Working Capital Practices
 Inventory: We generally import casegoods inventory and certain upholstery items in amounts that enable us to meet the delivery requirements of our customers, our internal in-stock goals and minimum purchase requirements from our sourcing partners. However, a large percentage of products sold are not warehoused by us, but ship directly to our customers and thus not included as inventory.   We do not carry significant amounts of domestically produced upholstery inventory or hospitality products, as most of these products are built to order and are shipped shortly after their manufacture.
 Accounts receivable: Substantially all of our trade accounts receivable are due from retailers and dealers that sell residential home furnishings or commercial purchasers of our hospitality and senior living products, which consist of a large number of entities with a broad geographic dispersion.  We perform credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral.  For qualified customers, we offer payment terms, generally requiring payment 30 days from shipment. However, we may offer extended payment terms in certain circumstances, including to promote sales of our products. Due to the highly-customized nature of our hospitality products, we typically require a 50% deposit with order, a 40% deposit before goods reach a U.S. port and the remaining 10% balance due within 30 days of the receipt of goods by the customer.
 Accounts payable: Payment for our imported products warehoused first in Asia is due ten to fourteen days after our quality audit inspections are complete and the vendor invoice is presented. Payment for goods which are shipped to our US warehouses or container direct to our customers FOB Origin is generally due upon proof of lading onto a US-bound vessel and invoice presentation; however payment terms, depending on supplier, can stretch up to 45 days from invoice date. Payment terms for domestic raw materials and non-inventory related charges vary, but are generally 30 days from invoice date.
 Order Backlog
 At January 29, 2017, our backlog of unshipped orders was as follows:
 
6
 


 
 | Order Backlog | 
-----------------+-------------------+--------
 | (Dollars in 000s) | 
 | January 29, 2017 | | January 31, 2016
Segment | Dollars | | Weeks | | Dollars | | Weeks 
Hooker Casegoods | $ | 10,091 | | 3.7 | | $ | 12,310 | 4.1
Upholstery | | 10,670 | | 6.8 | | | 9,163 | 5.7
Home Meridian | | 82,843 | | 12.5 | | | - | - 
All Other | | 952 | | 5.5 | | | 950 | 6.1
Consolidated | $ | 104,556 | | 9.4 | | $ | 22,423 | 4.7

   For our legacy Hooker businesses, we consider unshipped order backlogs to be one helpful indicator of sales for the upcoming 30-day period, but because of our relatively quick delivery and our cancellation policies (discussed under Warehousing and Distribution, above), we do not consider order backlogs to be a reliable indicator of expected long-term sales. We consider the Home Meridian segment’s backlog to be one helpful indicator of that segment’s sales for the upcoming 90-day period. Due to (i) Home Meridian’s sales volume, (ii) the average sales order sizes of its mass, club and mega account channels of distribution and (iii) the custom nature of many of its products and (iv) the project nature of its hospitality business, that segment’s average order sizes tend to be larger and consequently, its order backlog tends to be larger. As compared to its pre-Acquisition backlog levels, the Home Meridian segment’s backlog at January 29, 2017, was about average.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales in our fiscal first quarter are generally lower than our other fiscal quarters due to post Chinese New-Year shipping lag and sales in our fiscal fourth quarter are generally stronger due to the pre-Chinese New Year surge in shipments from Asia and the product introduction schedule of a major customer.
Environmental Matters
 
As a part of our business operations, our manufacturing sites generate both non-hazardous and hazardous wastes; the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local, state and national laws relating to environmental protection.  We are in various stages of investigation, remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination,  none of which we believe is material to our results of operations or financial position.  Our policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  The costs associated with our environmental responsibilities, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position.
Employees
 
As of January 29, 2017, we had 952 full-time employees, of which 216 were employed in our Hooker Casegoods segment, 403 were employed in our Upholstery segment, 326 were employed in our Home Meridian segment and 7 employed in our All Other segment. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.  We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Patents and Trademarks
 
The Hooker Furniture, Bradington-Young, Sam Moore, Pulaski Furniture, Samuel Lawrence, Room Gear, Right2Home, Home Meridian International, Prime Resources International, and Sourcing Solutions Group trade names represent many years of continued business.  We believe these trade names are well-recognized and associated with quality and service in the furniture industry.  We also own a number of patents and trademarks, both domestically and internationally, none of which is considered to be material.

Governmental Regulations
 
Our company is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health, employment and environmental pollution controls, as well as U.S. and international trade laws and regulations.  We are also subject to foreign laws and regulations. In the past, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had any material effect on our earnings, capital expenditures, or competitive position in excess of those affecting others in our industry; however, the effect of compliance with these laws and regulations in the future cannot be predicted.  We believe we are in material compliance with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations.
