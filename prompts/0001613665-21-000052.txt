ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
We are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware and maintain our principal executive office in Sioux Falls, SD. We are a full-service regional bank holding company focused on relationship-based commercial banking through our wholly owned banking subsidiary. Our Bank was established more than 80 years ago and has achieved strong market positions by developing and maintaining extensive local relationships in the communities we serve.
We serve our customers through a network of 174 branches in attractive markets in nine states: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Our branch system funds our lending activities and allows us to better serve both business and consumer depositors. We provide a wide range of services, including commercial and consumer loan and depository services, private banking, brokerage, trust, investment advisory and other traditional banking services. Our total loans and total assets were $8.19 billion and $12.91 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2021. We consider our Bank to be our sole operating segment.
Pending Merger of First Interstate BancSystem and Great Western Bancorp
On September 16, 2021, First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIBK), parent company of First Interstate Bank, and Great Western Bancorp, Inc., parent company of Great Western Bank, announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which the companies will combine in an all‐stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by both companies’ Boards of Directors, Great Western will merge into FIBK and the combined holding company and bank will operate under the First Interstate name and brand with the company’s headquarters remaining in Billings, Montana. Pending regulatory and shareholder approvals and the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the agreement, the transaction is expected to close during the first calendar quarter of 2022.
Our Subsidiaries
In addition to our bank, we own non-bank subsidiaries that have issued trust preferred securities which qualify as Tier 2 regulatory capital instruments. The trust subsidiaries are not included in our consolidated financial statements. Our investments in the trust subsidiaries are included in other assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition. Our Bank has subsidiary interests that are not significant to the consolidated entity.
Our Strategy
We are focused on asset quality, maintaining a diversified loan portfolio and building our core deposit base. We also thoughtfully and strategically seek to control expenses in an effort to gain operational efficiencies.
Our banking model seeks to balance the best of being a "big enough" and a "small enough" bank, providing capabilities typical of a much larger bank, such as diversified product specialists, customized banking solutions and multiple delivery channels, with a customer-focused culture usually associated with smaller banks. Our relationship bankers strive to build deep, long-term relationships with customers and understand the customers' specific needs to identify appropriate financial solutions.
We focus on commercial banking, complemented by our agri-business banking, retail banking and wealth management services. We offer small and mid-sized businesses a focused suite of financial products and have established strong relationships across a diversified range of sectors. We also provide a range of deposit and loan products to our retail customers through several channels, including our branch network, online banking system, mobile banking applications and customer care centers. In our wealth management business, we seek to deepen our customer relationships by offering private banking, financial planning, investment management, trust and insurance services. 
We earn interest income on loans as well as fee income from the origination of loans. Lending activities include loans to commercial clients, which include commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and letters of credit, agri-business clients and individuals, which primarily consist of small business loans, home equity lines of credit, residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Residential real estate loans are either kept in our loan portfolio or sold to secondary investors, which results in gains or losses from the sales being recognized. We also provide diversified treasury management services tailored to meet the needs of our business and agri customers. Our Treasury Management solutions include Business Online and Mobile Banking, Business Bill Pay, ACH collections and payments, Remote Deposit Capture, and a variety of tools to protect against fraud and manage excess funds.
We pay interest on the interest-bearing deposits and receive service fee revenue on various accounts. Deposit accounts include products such as noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing checking, savings and money market and time deposits. Debit and ATM cards provide clients with access to their accounts 24 hours a day at any ATM location. We also provide 24-hour telephone access and online banking as well as other electronic and mobile banking services.
In addition to the community banking services of lending and providing deposit services, we seek to deepen our customer relationships by offering comprehensive wealth management, trust and investment services.

The key components of our strategy include the following:
Attract and Retain High-Quality Relationship Bankers
We believe we have been successful in recruiting qualified relationship bankers due primarily to our decentralized management approach, focused product suite and flexible, customer-focused culture while continuing to provide sophisticated banking capabilities to serve our customers' needs. By leveraging the strong networks and reputation of experienced local relationship bankers, we believe we can continue to build a foundation for organic growth as well as offer customers a range of products and services to fulfill their financial needs.
Optimize Footprint in Existing and Complementary Markets
Our strategy has been to pursue attractive growth opportunities to expand within our existing footprint and enter new markets aligned with our business model and strategic plans. We believe we can increase our presence in under-represented areas in our existing markets and broaden our footprint in attractive markets adjacent and complementary to our current markets by continuing our emphasis on commercial and agri-business banking. 
Deepen Customer Relationships
We believe that our reputation, expertise and relationship-based banking model enable us to deepen our relationships with our customers. We look to leverage our relationships with existing customers by offering a range of products and services suitable to their needs such as online and mobile banking for consumer customers. We offer alternative cash management solutions intended to help retain business customers. We seek to expand and enhance our wealth management platform through focused product offerings that we believe will appeal to our more affluent customers. We intend to continue to capitalize on opportunities to capture more business from existing customers throughout our banking network.
Continue to Improve Efficiency and Manage Costs
We believe that our focus on operational efficiency is critical to our business strategy. We intend to carefully manage our cost structure and continuously refine and implement internal processes and technology to create further efficiencies to enhance our earnings. In addition, we continue to optimize our branch network through either closure or relocation of some of our less profitable branches.
Opportunistically Pursue Acquisitions
Over the past decade we have successfully completed two acquisitions, including our 2016 acquisition of HF Financial, which represented approximately $1.12 billion in acquired assets. Our strategy has been to consider acquisitions that are consistent with our business strategy and financial model as opportunities arise.
Products and Services
Commercial Banking
We provide commercial banking services to small and mid-sized businesses across a diverse range of industries, including key sectors such as commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, construction and development, multifamily residential real estate, hospitality/tourism, agri-business services (e.g., farm equipment suppliers and grain and seed merchants), healthcare (e.g., hospitals, physicians, care facilities and dentists) and diversified commercial and industrial businesses. We offer our commercial banking customers a focused range of financial products designed to meet the specific needs of their businesses, including loans, lines of credit, cash management services, lockbox, healthcare receivables management, sweep accounts, remote deposit capture, merchant services that include payment and point of sale solutions, online business deposit and wire transfer services, in addition to noninterest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing non-transaction accounts and corporate credit cards. Our Treasury Banking Suite lineup provides businesses real-time information, reports, file exports, ACH origination, domestic and international incoming and outgoing wires, with positive pay and other controls and security to mitigate risk.
Agri-business Banking
We consider agri-business lending one of our core competencies. We provide loans and banking services to agri-business customers from short-term working capital funding to long-term and-related lending, as well as other tailored services. Through relationships with insurance agencies, we make available to our customers crop insurance that can provide farms with options for financial protection from various events, including flood, derecho, drought, hail, fire, disease, insect damage, wildfire and earthquake. We predominantly lend to grain and protein producers who produce a range of agricultural commodities, dairy farms and beef cattle operations. Our agri-business customers range in size from small family farms to large commercial farming operations.

Retail Banking
Retail banking provides a source of low-cost funding and deposit-related fee income. We offer traditional banking products to our retail customers, including noninterest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts and time deposits. We also serve our customers through a wide range of non-branch channels; including online, telephone and mobile banking platforms. We recently rebranded and updated our entire suite of consumer products to ensure we are offering accounts that provide top value and reward loyalty with features that fit our customers' unique lifestyles. As of September 30, 2021, we converted over 338,000 accounts to one of our new deposit account offerings: the Smart Start Banking account geared toward a younger market demographic with no availability for overdraft, our Essential Checking account created for everyday needs, and Relationship Checking geared towards customers that would prefer an interest bearing account, among other advantages, our Employee Account, enhanced Health Savings Account, money market account, savings account, or private banking account.
At September 30, 2021, we offered ATM services at 163, or 93.7%, of our branches and at other off-site locations. We are part of the MoneyPass and SHAZAM networks, enabling our customers to withdraw cash surcharge-free and service charge-free at over 35,000 ATM locations across the country.
The following table presents our retail branch network spread among our six regions.
 | September 30, 2021
 | Number of branches | % of branches
South Dakota / Minnesota / North Dakota | 39 | 22.4 | %
Iowa and Missouri | 54 | 31.0 | %
Nebraska and Kansas | 52 | 29.9 | %
Arizona | 9 | 5.2 | %
Colorado | 20 | 11.5 | %
Total | 174 | 100.0 | %

We also provide a variety of loan products to individuals. At September 30, 2021, our consumer portfolio comprised of residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, personal loans, lines of credit, auto loans and consumer credit cards. We also originate residential mortgage loans for resale (including their servicing) on the secondary market.
Wealth Management
We also provide our customers with a selection of wealth management solutions, including financial planning, private banking, investment management and trust services through associations with third party vendors, including registered broker-dealers and our investment adviser, and the offer and sale of insurance solutions, including life insurance. Our investment representatives offer our customers investment management services through our branch network which entails overseeing and recommending investment allocations between asset classes based on a review of a client’s risk tolerance. 
Competition
The financial services industry and each of the markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive. We face strong competition in gathering deposits, making loans and obtaining client assets for management by our investment or trust operations. Our principal competitors for deposits, loans and client assets for management by our investment or trust operations include commercial banks, savings banks and associations, credit unions, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, factoring companies and other non-bank financial companies. Some of these competitors are local, while others are statewide or national. Competition is also increasing for deposit and lending services from internet-based competitors and nonfinancial institutions. 
Human Capital
As of September 30, 2021, we had 1,706 total employees, which included 1,607 full-time employees and 99 part-time employees. Of our 1,706 employees, 1,130 are in core banking (i.e., non-line of business branch network employees, including relationship bankers), 50 employees are in lines of business (e.g., mortgage, credit cards, investments), 42 employees are in finance, 260 employees are in support services (i.e., employees in operations, IT and projects), 145 employees are in risk and credit management, 14 employees are in internal audit and 65 employees are in other functions. We believe our relationship with our employees to be good. We have not experienced any material employment-related issues or interruptions of services due to labor disagreements and are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
We provide professional development opportunities to our employees and seek to improve retention, development, and job satisfaction of our employees from diverse groups by providing career skills training, peer mentoring, and opportunities to interact with senior leaders. Throughout the year we also provide of regulatory training based upon the employees' roles and responsibilities. Employees are also encouraged to complete additional subject matter training made available on our intranet. 
We are committed to diversity and inclusion within our organization, the banking profession, and the communities where we live and work and we are committed to principles of equal employment opportunity. In recognizing the benefits of diversity, we are dedicated to attracting and retaining talent across a variety of backgrounds and experiences with varying perspectives and ideas, while having an inclusive culture. We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind.

We utilize anonymous employee surveys to seek valuable feedback on key initiatives and leverage the results to improve current programs as well as develop new programs. To drive employee engagement, we share the results with our employees. Additionally, senior leadership analyzes areas of progress or opportunities for improvement and prioritizes responsive actions and activities. Our management and cross-functional teams also work in close coordination to evaluate human capital management issues such as retention, training, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks.
We provide robust compensation and benefits programs, in addition to base pay, to help meet the needs of our employees. These programs include, subject to eligibility policies, annual incentives, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs and tuition assistance, among many others. We grant long-term incentive awards in the form of restricted stock and performance-based stock to a select group of senior leaders who we believe will play critical roles in the Company's future. We consistently monitor and adapt our total rewards program design to reflect both market changes and employee feedback.
We strive to be a good corporate citizen by supporting many local community organizations through financial contributions and employee-driven volunteerism, and encouraging employees to be engaged and serve in leadership roles in their communities. To encourage volunteering, we offer paid time off to volunteer at various non-profit organizations.
Our Board of Directors recognizes the importance of succession planning for our CEO and other key executives. The Board annually reviews our succession plans for senior leadership roles, with the goal of ensuring we will continue to have the right leadership talent in place to execute the organization's long-term strategic plans.

Supervision and Regulation
We and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state banking laws that establish a comprehensive framework for our operations. This framework may materially impact our growth potential and financial performance and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. Significant elements of the statutes, regulations and policies applicable to us and our subsidiaries are described below. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies described.
Regulatory Agencies
Bank Holding Company Regulation. We are a bank holding company under the BHC Act. Consequently, we and our subsidiaries are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act provides generally for "umbrella" regulation of bank holding companies and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has issued regulations under the BHC Act requiring a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that, pursuant to this requirement, a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support our Bank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
The FRB subjects the Company to its requirements on regulatory capital and maintaining cash reserves against its deposits. The FRB also regulates the national supply of bank credit in order to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, and affect the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. Fluctuations in interest rates, which may result from governmental fiscal policies and the monetary policies of the FRB, have a strong impact on the income derived from loans and securities, and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. While the Company and the Bank strive to model various interest rate changes and adjust our strategies for such changes, the level of earnings could be materially affected by economic circumstances beyond our control.
The BHC Act also requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire more than a 5% voting interest of any bank or bank holding company, or to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. We must also be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to acquire a bank located outside of our home state. Additionally, the BHC Act restricts our non-banking activities to those which are determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking and a proper incident thereto. The Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuing such activity, ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary or the bank holding company.
Under FDICIA, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become "undercapitalized" (as defined in FDICIA) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency.
11-


FDIC and SDDB Regulations. Our Bank is an FDIC-insured commercial bank chartered under the laws of South Dakota. It is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. Consequently, the FDIC and the SD Division of Banking are the primary regulators of our Bank and also regulate our Bank’s subsidiaries. As a South Dakota-chartered commercial bank, our Bank's business is generally limited to activities permitted by South Dakota law and any applicable federal laws. Subject to prior approval by the Director of the SD Division of Banking, our Bank may also permissibly engage in any activity permissible as of January 1, 2008 for a national bank doing business in South Dakota. Our Bank is also restricted under South Dakota law from investing in certain types of investment securities and is generally limited in the amount of money it can lend to a single borrower or invest in securities issued by a single issuer (in each case, 20% of our Bank's capital stock and surplus plus 10% of our Bank's undivided profits). The Bank Merger Act and South Dakota law generally require our Bank to obtain prior regulatory approval to merger or consolidate with, or acquire substantially all of the assets of or assume deposits of, another bank.
In addition, we offer certain insurance and investment products through our Bank and our Bank's subsidiaries that are subject to regulation and supervision by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies and by the FINRA as a result of a contractual relationship we have with a third party broker-dealer relating to the provision of some wealth management and investment services to customers.
CFPB Regulations. We are also subject to the enforcement and rule-making authority of the CFPB regarding consumer financial products. The CFPB has authority to create and enforce consumer protection rules and regulations and has the power to examine our Bank for compliance with such rules and regulations. The CFPB also has the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive or abusive" acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, such as our Bank.
Acquisitions of Ownership of the Company
Acquisitions of the Company's voting stock above certain thresholds may be subject to prior regulatory notice or approval under applicable federal banking laws. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval or notice under the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act.
Dividends
Our Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. As a bank holding company, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under applicable banking laws and regulations. Federal bank regulators are authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. Federal Reserve policy provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless (1) the bank holding company's net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) is sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and (3) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios. The policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company's capital structure. Bank holding companies also are required to consult with the Federal Reserve before materially increasing dividends. The Federal Reserve could prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by a bank holding company if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
Since substantially all of our income comes from dividends from our Bank, which is also the primary source of our liquidity, our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares depends upon our receipt of dividends from our Bank. In addition to the restrictions discussed above, our Bank is subject to limitations under South Dakota law regarding the level of dividends that it may pay to us. In general, dividends by our Bank may only be declared from its net profits and may be declared no more than once per calendar quarter. The approval of the South Dakota Director of Banking is required if our Bank seeks to pay aggregate dividends during any calendar year that would exceed the sum of its net profits from the year to date and retained net profits from the preceding two years, minus any required transfers to surplus.

Transactions with Affiliates
Transactions between our Bank and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and our Company or any other subsidiary, on the other hand, are regulated under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by our Bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B limit the extent to which our Bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of our Bank's capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus, and requires those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to our Bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In addition, any credit transactions with an affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral.
Federal law also limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% (or greater) stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. In addition, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of non-repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate.
Safety and Soundness Standards
The federal banking agencies have adopted the Interagency Guidelines for Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. These guidelines also prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the bank regulator must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution may be subject under the FDIA. See "—Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action." If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the bank regulator may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.
Deposit Insurance
FDIC Insurance Assessments. As an FDIC-insured bank, our Bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC based on its average total assets minus its average tangible equity. Our Bank’s assessment rates are currently based on its risk classification (i.e., the level of risk it poses to the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund). Institutions classified as higher risk pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk. With the acquisition of HF Financial in 2016, our total assets exceeded $10 billion as of the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Since our Bank's total consolidated assets have exceeded $10 billion for four consecutive quarters, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score to calculate the assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank’s capital level and regulatory supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. In addition to ordinary assessments described above, the FDIC has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances.
Other Assessments. In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation (FICO) to impose assessments on deposit insurance fund applicable deposits in order to service the interest on the Financing Corporation’s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments. The amount assessed on individual institutions is in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC’s risk-related assessment rate schedules. Assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base.

Interstate Branching
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2020 and other federal regulation, national and state-chartered banks, such as our Bank, may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state (e.g., a host state) by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch. Applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator and, where applicable, the bank's state regulatory authority. As our Bank is a South Dakota state chartered bank, we are required to file branch applications with both the FDIC and the SD Division of Banking.
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements
Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. We are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977
Under the CRA, our Bank has an obligation, consistent with safe and sound operations, to help meet the credit needs of the market areas where it operates, which includes providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. In connection with its examination of our Bank, the FDIC is required to assess our Bank’s compliance with the CRA. Our Bank’s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay in certain corporate applications filed by us or our Bank, including applications for branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company. Our Bank received an overall rating of "satisfactory" in its most recently completed CRA examination.
Future Legislation and Regulation
Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which we operate and may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and modify our business strategy, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects may be adversely affected, perhaps materially, as a result.
Depositor Preference
Under federal law, depositors (including the FDIC with respect to the subrogated claims of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the "liquidation or other resolution" of such an institution by any receiver.
Privacy and Consumer Financial Protection
We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, CAN-SPAM Act, and these laws' respective state law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight.

As a financial institution, our internal systems and vendor-outsourced storage solutions contain a significant amount of sensitive data, including personal information related to our customers. We are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal and state information security laws, among others, including the GLB Act, which institute limitations on data sharing and require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers. In addition, the GLB Act requires all financial institutions to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer data with nonaffiliated parties and establishes procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access. In addition, the FCRA, as amended by the FACT Act, includes provisions affecting the Company, the Bank and their affiliates, including provisions concerning obtaining consumer reports, furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies, maintaining a program to prevent identity theft, sharing of certain information among affiliated companies and other provisions, including rules regarding limitations on affiliate marketing and implementation of programs to identify, detect and mitigate certain identity theft red flags.
We are also subject to various regulatory guidance as updated from time to time implemented by the FFIEC, an interagency body of the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities. States and other jurisdictions may also enact laws regulating financial institutions' use of consumer data, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as well as the General Data Privacy Regulation adopted by the European Union.
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency, the CFPB, which was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection and privacy laws, such as the GLB Act, which have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys' fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorney generals and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorney generals in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
Heightened Requirements for Bank Holding Companies with $10 Billion or More in Assets
Various federal banking laws and regulations, including rules adopted by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, impose heightened requirements on certain banks and bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets. Because our Bank’s total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion, we or our Bank, as applicable, among other requirements:
•are subject to the maximum permissible interchange fee for swipe transactions, equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions;
•calculate our FDIC deposit assessment base using the performance score and a loss-severity score system described above in "—Deposit Insurance;" and
•are examined for compliance with federal consumer protection laws primarily by the CFPB as described above in "—Privacy and Consumer Financial Protection."
The Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent (3%) of Tier 1 Capital in private equity and hedge funds (known as the "Volcker Rule"). The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act and subsequent promulgation of inter-agency final rules have aimed at simplifying and tailoring requirements related to the Volcker Rule. In August 2019, the agencies modified the rule to, among other things, eliminate collection of certain metrics and reduce the compliance burdens associated with the remaining metrics requirements, depending on the banking entity's total consolidated trading assets and liabilities. The regulatory agencies continue to consider additional proposals to simplify or eliminate other aspects of the Volcker Rule. Due to the changing regulatory landscape, we will continue to evaluate the implications of the Volcker Rules on our investments, including new impacts as a result of the changes, but we do not expect any material financial implications.
Incentive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the SEC to maintain guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including us and our Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. Failure to comply can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

Regulatory Capital Requirements, Basel III and the Capital Rules
The Federal Reserve monitors our capital adequacy on a consolidated basis, and the FDIC and the SD Division of Banking monitor the capital adequacy of our Bank based on the Capital Rules, also known as the Basel III Capital Rules, which went into effect January 1, 2015, subject to certain phase-in provisions. The risk-based guidelines are intended to make regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. The Capital Rules are intended to measure capital adequacy with regard to a banking organization's balance sheet, including off-balance sheet exposures such as unused portions of loan commitments, letters of credit, and recourse arrangements. The capital requirements for the Company are similar to those for the Bank.
The rules implement the Basel Committee's December 2010 capital framework known as "Basel III" for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The failure of the Company or the Bank to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that could have a material effect on the Company.
The Regulatory Capital Rules require banking organizations (i.e., both the Company and the Bank) to maintain a minimum "common equity Tier 1" (or "CET1") ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). A capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels is required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends.
The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1 capital. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 25% of CET1 capital or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1 capital. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 capital began on January 1, 2015 and were phased in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The Capital Rules also generally preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, from being counted as Tier 1 capital for most bank holding companies. Bank holding companies such as us who had less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 (and who continue to have less than $15 billion in assets) are permitted to include trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 as Additional Tier 1 capital under the Capital Rules.
The Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that, depending on the nature of the assets, generally range from 0% for U.S. government securities, 20%-50% for U.S. government agencies and municipal bonds, 0%-150% for loans and up to 600% for certain equity exposures. 
With respect to our Bank, the Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA. See "—Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action."
We believe that, as of September 30, 2021, we and our Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Capital Rules.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action
Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take "prompt corrective action" with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
As a result of the Basel III Rules, new definitions of the relevant measures for the five capital categories took effect on January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreements, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
An institution is deemed to be "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and generally a leverage capital ratio of 4.0% or greater. The Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirements for any prompt corrective action category.
As of September 30, 2021, we and our Bank were well capitalized with Tier 1 capital ratios of 15.1% and 15.1%, respectively, total capital ratios of 16.3% and 16.1%, respectively, Tier 1 leverage ratios of 10.6% and 10.6%, respectively, and a CET1 capital ratio of 14.3% and 15.1%, respectively, as calculated under Basel III. For more information on these financial measures, including reconciliations to our and our Bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital."

An institution is deemed to be "undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or generally a leverage capital ratio of less than 4.0%. An institution is deemed to be "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0%, or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is deemed to be "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
"Undercapitalized" institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan and adequate assurances of performance. An institution's compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the bank's total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is "significantly undercapitalized". Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers; and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions and capital distributions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC.
Beginning 60 days after becoming "critically undercapitalized", critically undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within 270 days after it obtains such status.
In addition, the FDIA prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is well capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates.
Institutions that are undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. As of September 30, 2021, our Bank was "well capitalized" based on the existing ratios and the ratios as modified by Basel III Capital Rules.
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT ACT
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds from crime, including the BSA, as amended by Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the U.S. such as the Department of the Treasury's FinCEN and the FFIEC. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. We are required, as part of our BSA/AML/OFAC program, to designate a BSA Officer, maintain a BSA/AML training program, maintain internal controls to effectuate the BSA/AML program, implement independent testing of the BSA/AML program and comply with the CDD Rule and other rules promulgated from time to time.
Financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Among other provisions, the USA Patriot Act requires financial institutions to have anti-money laundering programs in place and requires banking regulators to consider a holding company's effectiveness in combating-money laundering when ruling on certain merger or acquisition applications. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including civil money penalties and causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The U.S. Treasury Department’s OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We and our Bank are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
Enterprise Risk Management
We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, analyze and control the types of risk to which we are subject. These risks include, among others, liquidity, credit, market, interest rate, operational, legal and compliance, and reputational risk. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. We also maintain a compliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable laws, policies and procedures. While we assess and improve these programs on an ongoing basis, there can be No assurance that our risk management or compliance programs, along with other related controls, will effectively mitigate risk under all circumstances, or that it will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as they may exist, or develop in the future, including risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.
Environmental Laws Potentially Impacting the Bank
We are subject to state and federal environmental laws and regulations. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, ("CERCLA"), is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this "secured creditor exemption" has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the property. 
Our properties and the tenants of our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of waste, underground and aboveground storage tanks, local fire safety requirements and local land use and zoning regulations. For example, some of our tenants handle regulated substances or waste as part of their operations on our properties. Noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us or our tenants to liability. These environmental liabilities could affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. Moreover, changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental, health and/or safety laws, including increasing liability for noncompliance or requiring significant unanticipated expenditures. For example, under the ADA, all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA might require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas where such removal is “readily achievable.” We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. Noncompliance with the ADA, however, could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. We believe that each of our properties is covered by adequate fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders) and property insurance, as well as commercial liability insurance. We also carry terrorism insurance at levels we believe are commercially reasonable. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of coverage and industry practice, and in the opinion of our management, the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. 
Recent Regulatory Reform in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Congress, through the enactment of the CARES Act, and the federal banking agencies, though rulemaking, interpretive guidance and modifications to agency policies and procedures, have taken a series of actions to provide national emergency economic relief measures including, among others, the following:
The CARES Act, as amended by the CAA 2021, allows banks to elect to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic for certain loans. The federal banking agencies also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 or offer other borrower friendly options.
The CARES Act amended the SBA's lending program, the PPP, to fund payroll and operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during COVID-19. The Bank will continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related to the PPP.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) requires that employers provide paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave. Numerous other state and federal regulations have been enacted affecting the workplace, including the Biden Administration Federal Workforce Vaccine Mandate through the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which requires that employers with greater than 100 employees either are vaccinated, or have weekly COVID testing. As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 the No Surprises Act was signed into law, which contains many changes to how insurance is administered and billed.
