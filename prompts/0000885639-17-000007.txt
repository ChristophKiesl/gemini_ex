Item 1. Business
Kohl’s Corporation (the “Company," “Kohl’s,” "we," "our" or "us") was organized in 1988 and is a Wisconsin corporation. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 1,154 Kohl's department stores, a website (www.Kohls.com), 12 FILA outlets, and three Off-Aisle clearance centers. Our Kohl's stores and website sell moderately-priced private label, exclusive and national brand apparel, footwear, accessories, beauty and home products. Our Kohl's stores generally carry a consistent merchandise assortment with some differences attributable to local preferences. Our website includes merchandise that is available in our stores, as well as merchandise that is available only on-line. 
Our merchandise mix includes both national brands and private and exclusive brands that are available only at Kohl's. National brands generally have higher selling prices, but lower gross margins, than private and exclusive brands. Most of our private brands are well-known established brands such as Apt. 9, Croft & Barrow, Jumping Beans, SO and Sonoma Goods for Life. Despite having lower selling prices, private brands generally have higher gross margins than exclusive and national brands. Exclusive brands are developed and marketed through agreements with nationally-recognized brands. Examples of our exclusive brands include Food Network, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Rock & Republic and Simply Vera Vera Wang. Exclusive brands have selling prices that are generally lower than national brands, but higher than private brands. Their gross margins are generally higher than national brands, but lower than private brands.
The following tables summarize our sales penetration by line of business and brand type over the last three years:

Distribution
We receive substantially all of our store merchandise at our nine retail distribution centers. A small amount of our merchandise is delivered directly to the stores by vendors or their distributors. The retail distribution centers, which are strategically located throughout the United States, ship merchandise to each store by contract carrier several times a week. On-line sales may be picked up in our stores or are shipped from a Kohl’s fulfillment center, retail distribution center or store; by a third-party fulfillment center; or directly by a third-party vendor.
See Item 2, “Properties,” for additional information about our distribution centers.

Employees
As of January 28, 2017, we employed approximately 138,000 associates, including approximately 32,000 full-time and 106,000 part-time associates. The number of associates varies during the year, peaking during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. None of our associates are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with our associates are very good.
Competition
The retail industry is highly competitive. Management considers style, quality and price to be the most significant competitive factors in the industry. Merchandise mix, brands, service, loyalty programs, credit availability, and customer experience and convenience are also key competitive factors. Our primary competitors are traditional department stores, upscale mass merchandisers, off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce.  Our specific competitors vary from market to market.
Merchandise Vendors
We purchase merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. All business partners must meet certain requirements in order to do business with us. Our Terms of Engagement include provisions regarding laws and regulations, employment practices, ethical standards, environmental and legal requirements, communication, monitoring/compliance, record keeping, subcontracting and corrective action. Our expectation is that all business partners will comply with these Terms of Engagement and quickly remediate any deficiencies, if noted, in order to maintain our business relationship.
Approximately 30% of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third-party purchasing agent. No vendors individually accounted for more than 5% of our net purchases during fiscal 2016. We have no significant long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our suppliers, and believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier. We believe we have good working relationships with our suppliers.
Seasonality
Our business, like that of most retailers, is subject to seasonal influences. The majority of our sales and income are typically realized during the second half of each fiscal year. The back-to-school season extends from August through September and represents approximately 15% of our annual sales. Approximately 30% of our annual sales occur during the holiday season in the months of November and December. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the fiscal year. 
Trademarks and Service Marks
The name “Kohl’s” is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary has over 190 additional registered trademarks, trade names and service marks, most of which are used in connection with our private label program.
