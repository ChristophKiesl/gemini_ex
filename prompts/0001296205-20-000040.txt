ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Business
We are global innovation leaders in accessories and technologies that empower mobile lifestyles, with a commitment to enhance every aspect of performance, productivity, and durability in mobile devices with our creative product solutions. Our business was initially created from the concept of using a clear film originally designed to protect the blades of military helicopters in harsh desert conditions to protect consumers’ mobile devices. Since then, we have endeavored to continuously innovate and improve our products to meet changing customer needs, and now offer a wide array of innovative products in several product categories to protect, enhance, and create a better mobile device experience. Mobile devices are essential to modern living and our mission is to enable the optimal mobile lifestyle through the use of our products.
We have created a platform to combine category-creating and innovative brands that we have acquired with our existing house of brands to address specific consumer needs and better empower a mobile lifestyle. We have an award-winning product portfolio that includes screen protection, protective cases, power cases, power management, wireless charging, audio, mobile keyboards, and other mobile accessories sold under the ZAGG®, InvisibleShield®, mophie®, IFROGZ®, BRAVEN®, Gear4®, and HALO® brands.
We maintain our corporate headquarters at 910 West Legacy Center Way, Suite 500, Midvale, Utah, 84047. Our telephone number is 801-263-0699 and our website address is www.ZAGG.com (the URL is included here as an inactive textual reference, and information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this report).
We have established four Corporate Objectives and four Core Values to act as a foundation for our corporate culture:

Corporate Objectives | Core Values 
The Preferred Brand | Integrity 
Creative Product Solutions | Passion 
Targeted Global Distribution | Care for People
Operational Excellence | Performance 

To better carry our Corporate Objectives and Core Values, we have also adopted six Cultural Beliefs that guide us daily:
•Be Brave - I respectfully listen, speak candidly, consistently exchange feedback and communicate broadly.
•Be Accountable - I see it, own it, solve it and do it.
•Be Better - I relentlessly pursue opportunities to improve.
•Reach Out - I reach across all boundaries to collaborate and create alignment.
•Take Charge - I make decisions, take the necessary risks and act with no fear of failure.
•ZOOM! - I learn fast, move fast, and deliver.
These Corporate Objectives are intended to align our functional teams’ goals and execution. Every one of our employees is trained to understand his or her role in executing these objectives. Each Core Value and Cultural Belief acts as a key component in working toward our Corporate Objectives of providing Creative Product Solutions, executing Targeted Global Distribution, achieving Operational Excellence, and being The Preferred Brand for our customers.

•Protection (screen protection and protective cases)
•Power (power stations, wireless chargers, and power cases)
•Audio (earbuds, headphones, and speakers)
•Productivity and Other (keyboards and other mobile accessory products)
These four general product categories are broken down by brand as follows:
InvisibleShield Products
InvisibleShield products, including InvisibleShield Film, InvisibleShield Glass, and our InvisibleShield On Demand® (“ISOD”) solution, are designed to provide premium, lifetime protection for mobile device screens against shattering or scratching through military-grade solutions. Our products are designed to provide peace of mind by enabling consumers to enjoy their mobile devices without the inconvenience of a shattered, cracked, or scratched screen. Our protective InvisibleShield Film and InvisibleShield Glass products offer consumers a wide array of protection types and features, all with a limited lifetime warranty.
InvisibleShield Film was originally developed to protect the leading edge of rotary blades on military helicopters. Through constant innovation, we continue to formulate new film that is designed to offer the highest standards in self-healing scratch and impact protection. Additionally, we provide custom-fit screen protection for thousands of device types through our automated ISOD solution. With our ISOD solution, retailers can supply consumers with screen protection for nearly any device model, all without having to hold excess inventory.
InvisibleShield Glass is designed to provide premium screen protection and clarity, along with a superior feel and compatible touch sensitivity. In 2018 and 2019, we launched the following products to provide add-on features beside the basic protection functions from impacts and scratches:
•VisionGuard™ - InvisibleShield Glass + VisionGuard™ was launched for Apple® iPhone® smartphones, Apple iPad® tablets and Google® Pixel® smartphones, which features protective EyeSafe® technology that filters out portions of the harmful high-energy visible blue light spectrum emanating from device screens, while maintaining the superior color performance of the device display.
•Ultra Clear™ - InvisibleShield Ultra VisionGuard™ and Ultra Clear™ was introduced for select smartphone models that offer maximum clarity and shatter protection with an advanced glass-like surface that feels as smooth as the smartphone’s original screen.
•Anti-Microbial Technology - InvisibleShield Glass Elite VisionGuard™ + with anti-microbial technology was launched for the Apple iPhone XS, XS Max and XR to promote digital wellness by eliminating 99.99% of harmful bacteria on the device screen. As the anti-microbial properties are infused in the glass, they will not wear away over time.
•Glass Elite Family - InvisibleShield Glass + VisionGuard™ + with anti-microbial technology, Glass Elite Anti-Glare, Glass Elite Privacy and Glass Elite was unveiled for the Apple iPhone 11 series and Google Pixel 4 series. The Glass Elite family of products features our most advanced technologies to date and is coupled with InvisibleShield's strongest screen protection ever.
We have maintained the leading market share in screen protection in the United States (“U.S.”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) by consistently delivering innovative InvisibleShield products to the market. We continue to innovate and expand our screen protection products to meet the evolution of new technology and consumer needs in the market.
Gear4 Products
Gear4 is a leader in smartphone cases with unique and stylish case designs, unparalleled protection, and proven durability. With Gear4's beginnings in the U.K., Gear4 grew to be one of the top selling U.K. smartphone case brands, and now has a global market for its products. Gear4 protective cases exclusively feature D3O® technology, which is designed to provide the thinnest and most advanced impact and shock absorption - the same material used in many professional sports, industrial, and military equipment applications. In their raw states, D3O materials can flow freely when manipulated slowly, but on shock lock together to absorb and disperse energy before instantly returning to their flexible state. In 2019, we released the Chelsea product line which is a new-to-market concept that allows consumers to express their personal style by swapping the design of their case with ease. With this new Gear4 innovation, consumers can easily insert the design between a Gear4 clear case and the device for the perfect combination of style and impact protection. In early 2020, we also expanded Gear4's product lineup to bring the D3O technology to the Apple iPad.
With D3O technology and our expansive global distribution channels, we believe Gear4 cases can offer the best mobile device protection experience for our customers and provide us with meaningful growth opportunities in our protection product line.
mophie Products

We believe that products under the HALO brand will continue to provide the most innovative mobile lifestyle solutions available on the market today and that these products will continue to be positioned to address the evolving needs of consumers around the world.

IFROGZ products are strategically designed and positioned to bring personal audio to the value space by providing a product assortment that represents outstanding performance, active lifestyles, and dual-purpose designs that are on trend with consumers’ needs. IFROGZ refines today’s newest audio technology to deliver the features consumers want, while eliminating those that needlessly increase costs so that everyone can participate in our increasingly mobile world.
IFROGZ EarPollution® product line of earbuds and headphones specifically target a younger demographic while still appealing to a wide spectrum of consumers. In 2019, we launched the AIRTIMETM Truly Wireless Earbuds, which include quick-charging and auto-pair technology that connects both earbuds to any Bluetooth® device seamlessly. Shortly following the launch of the AIRTIME, we launched AIRTIME PRO Truly Wireless Earbuds with the latest audio technology features, enabling consumers to enjoy audio streaming and hands-free calling free from wires.
In early 2020, we unveiled the AIRTIME VIBE active noise cancellation headphones which reduce ambient noise by approximately twenty decibels at the push of a button, as well as AIRTIME Sport Truly Wireless Earbuds with around-the-ear sport wings and an IPX5 water resistance built for an active lifestyle.
We continue to innovate and expand our headphone and earbud product lines under the IFROGZ brand to include offerings for all ages under both the IFROGZ and EarPollution product lines.

We anticipate that the combination of high audio quality, ease of use, and superior features will enable us to continue to expand the BRAVEN brand.
ZAGG Products
Products under the ZAGG brand are designed to empower people to live their lives unleashed. Mobility is changing how consumers do everything in their lives and we seek to drive the mobile lifestyle forward with products that are designed to allow consumers to be productive and connected at work, at play, and at rest. ZAGG products, which include keyboards and cases, are designed to free consumers from the confines of the traditional workplace. We believe “getting away” shouldn’t mean being disconnected. As such, our ZAGG products feature cutting-edge design and innovation to provide portability, style, and productivity that can keep up with even the most active mobile users. We support the communicators, commuters, creators, and closers who live a mobile lifestyle. With the right ZAGG mobile accessories, we believe no one ever needs to feel tethered or held back.
ZAGG keyboards are designed to offer consumers an enhanced and innovative productivity experience. Since entering this category, we have continually reinvented the ZAGG line of keyboards while also providing timely, curated solutions for new devices released by Apple, Microsoft®, and Samsung, as well as other leading mobile device providers. In addition to device-specific keyboards and folio keyboard cases, the ZAGG line of universal full-size Bluetooth keyboards are designed to be compatible with virtually any device and mobile operating system. In 2019, we unveiled the Slim Book™ Go, Rugged Book™ Go, and Messenger Folio™ keyboards for iPad and iPad Pro models which feature a protective yet lightweight design that boasts backlit, laptop-style keys for ultimate productivity in today’s on-the-go world.
We continue to innovate and expand our wireless keyboard product lines as end users’ requirements evolve in this rapidly changing market.
Our Strategy
The focus of our business is to (1) design creative product solutions for users of mobile devices, (2) sell these products to consumers through targeted global distribution partners, retail partners, televised home shopping channels, and online, (3) drive operational excellence across the organization, and (4) become the preferred brand through emphasizing innovation and product quality, providing excellent customer service, and focusing on the end-users’ experience with our products. We focus our corporate, team, and individual goals to accomplish these overall corporate objectives.
We plan to continue to expand our product offerings, including competing in new product categories and entering new domestic and global markets that we believe will be consistent with our overall corporate strategy. We believe that by innovating within existing product categories, entering new geographic markets, and competing in new product categories, we can achieve our stated objectives and meet our strategic goals.
Design and Packaging
We design our InvisibleShield Film and Glass products for application on thousands of specific electronic devices. Our logistics partners acquire precision-cut raw materials from exclusive third-party suppliers. These precision-cut InvisibleShield Film and Glass products either use the EZ Apply tabs installation or are packaged with an installation kit consisting of a moisture adhesive-activating solution, a squeegee, and instructions for application on specific electronic devices. We have established relationships with package assembly, shipping, and logistics companies worldwide that we expect will allow us to expand production and shipping capacity for InvisibleShield Film and Glass production as we continue to grow existing markets and enter new markets.
We also customize each InvisibleShield Film cut design for the specific electronic device and currently have thousands of unique designs. Each cut design is developed internally and is owned exclusively by us. We do not own the patent for the raw materials, which is held by our exclusive supplier. Our InvisibleShield Film supplier has contractually agreed to not sell the base materials to any of our competitors. We believe that our relationship with the manufacturer of the raw material is on excellent terms and anticipate no interruption in our ability to acquire adequate supplies of raw materials and produce products.
We manufacture our other mobile device accessories (InvisibleShield Glass, keyboards, keyboard cases, audio products, cases, power cases, mobile power solutions, wireless charging solutions, and other accessories) using third-party contract manufacturers located primarily in Asia. We have established relationships with third-party manufacturers, package assembly, warehousing, shipping, and logistics companies that allow us to expand our accessories production and shipping capacity as we continue to grow our current customer base and enter new markets.
For all our products, we design the exterior packaging to ensure it is consistent with our overall marketing strategy and the desires of our major retailer partners. We have designed the hard plastic and cardboard box packaging to be informative and attractive for point-of-sale displays, and continue to make significant progress in making our packaging and products more environmentally sustainable. We outsource the production of packaging to various independent third-parties.
Market for Products
Portable electronic devices, notably handheld devices, continue to advance in performance and functionality. Furthermore, the market is expanding as evidenced by continued innovative new product releases, particularly in smartphones and tablets. Correspondingly, the aesthetics of such devices are increasingly important as buyers typically consider the look and feel of such devices, as much as performance, in making their purchasing decisions.
As a result, a significant market has emerged for protecting portable electronic devices and enhancing the consumer experience by providing power, audio, and other accessories for such devices. We sell each of our product lines to consumers of electronic and hand-held devices directly through our website, televised home shopping channels and other key online retailers, and through our global distribution and retail partners. We sell a significant amount of product for use on Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices, and Samsung Galaxy® smartphones and tablets, although we have experienced continued diversification as other manufacturers’ presence in the market has increased.
In addition to the Apple and Samsung devices noted above, the handheld electronics industry has continued to develop and market devices with touch screen interfaces, and several major manufacturers, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon®, Motorola®, Dell®, Lenovo®, Blackberry®, Xiaomi®, Huawei®, and HTC®, continue to release innovative products each year. The InvisibleShield product line is the ideal device protection offering for all types of touchscreen devices, as it does not interfere with the functionality of the device while offering complete scratch-proof protection. Our ZAGG keyboard product line is ideal for tablet and smartphone users as the product line includes keyboards that are both device-specific and device-agnostic. In addition, our IFROGZ audio product line offers excellent enhancement to any mobile device and our BRAVEN audio product line provides high-end audio quality for outdoor adventure. Our mophie power product line and our newly acquired HALO power product line is viewed as a potential opportunity for significant future growth as mobile devices become more ingrained in our day-to-day lives. Lastly, our Gear4 protective case product line offers stylish smartphone and tablet cases made with the innovative D3O material that provides the best protection to mobile devices. We intend to continue to focus our marketing and innovation efforts around these types of product solutions.
Market Segments
With thousands of InvisibleShield products/product configurations available, we have a protective covering available for all major market segments of handheld electronic devices, including smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, laptops, gaming devices, smartwatches, and similar devices and surfaces. We intend to continue to configure the InvisibleShield product for use in newly developed consumer devices. The InvisibleShield can be quickly configured, packaged, and shipped to customers for new devices as they enter the consumer marketplace, making our InvisibleShield products available for purchase at the time of or within days of the launch of new electronic devices. Equally important, ISOD, our solution used to cut an InvisibleShield for virtually any mobile device in seconds, makes it possible for retailers to have an InvisibleShield available on the launch date for all device releases.
The smartphone segment continues to be a significant market. Along with the tablet market, buyers are drawn to new devices by their design, as well as their updated functionality. However, everyday use often mars the finish of the devices’ screens and other areas that receive wear and tear. InvisibleShield protection products, as well as Gear4 branded cases, offer excellent device protection, while not impeding the style and the form or functionality of smartphones and tablets and do not inhibit the touch sensitivity of devices with touch screen technology. Specifically, the recent addition of VisionGuard technology to our InvisibleShield products helps protect device users’ eyesight when using their mobile devices. Further, our ZAGG keyboard line provides a professional and innovative solution with stylish and lightweight design to interact with tablets and smartphones that boasts ultimate productivity for the users. Our IFROGZ audio line enables technology-rich audio experiences from well-designed and intuitive products. Lastly, the mophie ecosystem provides power accessories for virtually any mobile device.
With our acquisition of BRAVEN Audio, we are able to offer outdoor enthusiasts the toughest audio products with high-end sound quality virtually anywhere they go. Such high quality audio products, together with our existing global distribution channels, will enable us to increase our visibility in this particular market.
With the addition of Gear4 to our portfolio of brands, we are better enabled to provide top-of-the-line and modern case protection using D3O technology to protect and accessorize mobile devices used by consumers around the world.
HALO adds new distribution channels to our portfolio, including HALO's strong relationship with QVC, a global leader in televised home shopping and e-commerce. By adding HALO to our portfolio of brands, we will be unique at offering, at scale, HALO's innovative products and be better positioned to address the evolving needs of consumers around the world.
As sales of consumer electronics continue to grow, we anticipate that sales of our complementary accessory products will also continue to grow. One of our largest areas of market opportunity relates to the sale of our products in conjunction with the release of new smartphones and tablets.
Management believes that we are positioned to serve market needs within this industry with our multiple product lines that include screen protection, power cases, power management, wireless charging, audio, mobile keyboards, protective cases, and other mobile accessories.
Marketing and Distribution
Domestically, we sell our products on our website, to big box electronics retailers, to wireless retailers, on televised home shopping channels, to other product distributors and retailers, and to franchisees that operate cellphone repair locations, kiosks, and ZAGG-branded stores in shopping malls and retail centers. In addition, our products are available for sale worldwide through our website as well as through non-U.S. retailers and distributors via our subsidiaries in Ireland, China, and other international locations. Currently, we advertise our products primarily on the internet, on television through QVC and HSN spotlights, through print advertisements in conjunction with our retail partners, and through point of sale displays at retail locations. We intend to continue to strategically expand our advertising activities in 2020, particularly through point of sales displays at retailer locations, social media campaigns on the internet, and on QVC and HSN. We are also seeking to create and improve strategic partnerships with makers of smartphones and tablets, electronic accessories, and mobile content providers to enhance our product offerings.
Indirect Channels (amounts in thousands)
We sell our products through indirect channels, including big box retailers, wireless retailers, domestic and international distributors, independent Apple retailers, university bookstores, and small independently owned consumer electronics stores. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold $453,655 of product, or approximately 87% of our overall net sales, through this channel. We enter into reseller agreements with many of our indirect channel partners.
We continue to sell directly to retailers or through distributors to market and place our products for sale in the U.S. and non-U.S. markets. We have entered into distribution agreements with partners throughout the world for the marketing, distribution and sale of our products.
Website Sales (amounts in thousands)
We sell our products worldwide directly to consumers on our website at www.ZAGG.com.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold $42,387 of product, or approximately 8% of our overall net sales, through our website.
Franchises (amounts in thousands)
In addition to operating a corporate ZAGG-branded store, we sell our products to third-party franchisees that operate cellphone repair locations, kiosks, and ZAGG-branded stores in shopping malls and retail centers. We enter into agreements with franchisees who purchase our products and resell them to consumers.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold $25,880 of product, or approximately 5% of our overall net sales, to franchisees and via our corporate owned store.
Warranties
All of our products purchased by consumers through authorized retailers have varying levels of warranty coverage. For InvisibleShield-branded products, we offer a limited lifetime warranty, with the exception of InvisibleShield Liquid Defense+TM which includes a limited screen guarantee. If the InvisibleShield product is ever scratched or damaged in the course of normal use, a customer may return the old product and we will replace it at no cost to the customer, other than a minimal handling fee. The devices to which the InvisibleShield products are applied typically have relatively short lives, which helps to limit our exposure for warranty claims. Should products cease to function properly, we also offer manufacturer's warranties. For HALO products purchased from ZAGG.com or an authorized ZAGG-branded retail outlet, we offer a 90-day manufacturer's warranty; for ZAGG and IFROGZ branded products, we offer a one-year manufacturer's warranty; and for mophie-branded products, BRAVEN-branded products, and Gear4 speakers, we offer a two-year manufacturer's warranty. For Gear4-branded products (excluding Gear4 speakers), mophie PRO cable and Earbud Tips for Life tips, we offer a limited lifetime warranty.
Suppliers
We do not directly manufacture any of our products, rather we employ various third-party manufacturing partners in the U.S. and Asia to perform these services on our behalf. The services provided by these third-parties include the selection of sub-suppliers that provide raw materials and other components used in the manufacturing process. We have endeavored to use common components and readily available raw materials in the design of our products that can be sourced from multiple sub-suppliers. However, raw film used in our InvisibleShield Film and ISOD products has been produced by a single supplier for the last 10 years. Our InvisibleShield film supplier has contractually agreed to not sell the raw materials to any of our competitors. In addition, our anti-microbial supplier has contractually granted us an exclusive right to purchase the materials in North America in the consumer technology mobile industry. 
Below is a high-level summary by product category of the manufacturing sources we use:
•Protection (Screen Protection and Cases) – Our screen protection product line is comprised of InvisibleShield Glass products (approximately 75% of 2019 screen protection sales or 33% of net sales), InvisibleShield Film products (approximately 13% of 2019 screen protection sales or 6% of net sales), and ISOD film blanks (approximately 12% of 2019 screen protection sales or 5% of net sales). Our InvisibleShield Glass products are sourced from factories in Asia with protective glass expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components. Our InvisibleShield Film and ISOD products are sourced through our third-party logistics partner, who purchases the raw film inventory from a U.S.-based single supplier (as discussed above). The VisionGuard raw materials are provided to the manufacturers through an exclusive licensing agreement with a third-party partner.
Our protective case product line consists primarily of Gear4 cases featuring D3O technology designed to protect smartphones and tablets. Our protective cases are sourced from factories in Asia with expertise in case protection manufacturing, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components. The D3O raw materials are provided to our manufacturers through an exclusive licensing agreement with a third-party partner who is the sole manufacturer of D3O materials.
•Power (Power Management and Power Cases) – Our power management product line consists of power products that are designed to provide on-the-go power for tablets, smartphones, smartwatches, cameras, and virtually all other electronic mobile devices. With the addition of HALO to our mophie portfolio, our combined power management product line includes power stations, wireless charging, car and wall chargers, portable power, power wallets, and more. Our power products are sourced from factories in Asia with battery expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components.
•Audio – Our audio product line consists of earbuds, headphones, and speakers that are designed to be compatible with virtually all electronic mobile devices. Our audio products are sourced from factories in Asia with audio expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components.
•Productivity (Keyboards and Other) – Our keyboard product line consists of (1) device-specific keyboards designed to fit individual tablets produced by original equipment manufacturers, and (2) keyboards that are designed to be device-agnostic and can be used on virtually any mobile device. Our keyboard products are sourced from factories in Asia with keyboard expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components.
Our product and operations teams work closely with suppliers from initial product development and throughout the manufacturing process to ensure that (1) the supplier understands and will build according to product specifications, (2) appropriate quality is maintained for the finished goods and for all sub-components, and (3) the supplier can meet our supply needs.
Intellectual Property (“IP”) Rights
We own utility and design patents in the U.S. and in various foreign countries which correspond to a number of our products, including patents with claims focused on certain features of our InvisibleShield screen protection for electronic devices. Although we develop a portion of our IP through internal innovation, IP is also obtained through strategic acquisitions. We continue to actively pursue additional IP for our developing product portfolio, including patents and applications for our InvisibleShield screen protection and associated methods in the U.S. and in foreign countries, by filing patent applications for (i) both wet and dry application processes for securing protective InvisibleShield film products to consumer electronic devices; (ii) dry-application protective InvisibleShield film products; and (iii) on-demand production of electronic device accessories, including InvisibleShield film products. In addition, we have filed applications, and in some instances secured patents, for a variety of our battery cases, mobile power, wireless charging, keyboard, audio and protective case products. We have additional patents pending in the U.S. and internationally for a variety of current and expected products.
We own thousands of InvisibleShield Film designs for protecting a variety of consumer electronic devices. New designs are routinely added to our portfolio to accommodate the newest electronic devices on the market. Additionally, we are the owner of numerous trademarks for use in connection with our goods and services. We have acquired many trademarks through our strategic acquisitions, have filed formal applications for a variety of trademarks, and have further secured trademark registrations for many of our trademarks in both the U.S. and in foreign countries.
We have strategically developed relationships, and in some cases, exclusive agreements, with third-party vendors and suppliers. Our long-standing relationships with raw material suppliers and manufacturers expand the scope of potential IP protection available to us, including development of innovative solutions for protective films and glass. These relationships also provide us with a reasonable expectation that we will be able to supply customers with products long into the future.
Our InvisibleShield film, VisionGuard, and D3O suppliers retain the patents and IP rights for products developed on our behalf, though these suppliers have contractually agreed to not sell the raw materials to any of our competitors. IP protection held by us varies in effectiveness in preventing certain aspects of competition. Although we believe IP protection is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, or exclusive rights thereto, we view the following as our keys to past and future success: (1) our distribution relationships with customers, (2) the speed with which we can bring a product to market, and (3) our ability to effectively launch a product into market to generate maximum sales. We also believe our success is based upon creative product solutions, establishing the preferred brand among both retailers and consumers, targeted global distribution and operational excellence.
The addition of our BRAVEN, Gear4, and HALO brands, including the IP associated with those brands, has added to our expanding IP portfolio. We believe that this IP, which includes patent and trademark protections, will assist us in maintaining competitive advantages with these technologies into the future.
Protection of IP is important to us and we protect IP when appropriate; however, we do not view IP in our industry as the key barrier to entry because of our rapidly changing industry. Often, by the time we receive patent or other IP protection on a product that would serve as a barrier to entry, the market has moved on to new technologies or products. Given this, we are selective in the IP we pursue, measuring the cost to protect certain aspects of IP against the potential benefit.
Due to our close partnership with global suppliers, our third-party logistics partner, and the manufacturer of the raw film used in our InvisibleShield and ISOD products, our product development teams work directly with these partners in the development of products. We enter into contractual agreements with some of our global suppliers to leverage IP technology and patents of these partners and suppliers. For the other key global suppliers, we have contractually agreed that we will retain all patents and IP rights to products that arise through our relationship, including design changes and innovations regardless of who instigates the product development change.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 628 full-time and part-time employees, including our management team. 479 of our employees are located in the U.S. and support our domestic operations, while 149 employees are located outside the U.S. to support our international operations. No employee is represented by a labor union, and we have never suffered an interruption of business due to labor disputes. We believe our relationship with our employees is good and have made efforts to ensure fair compensation, competitive benefits, and a positive working environment.
Environment Law Compliance
We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters in the U.S. and other countries, specifically for the materials used in our products, product-related energy consumption, and the recycling of our products, batteries, and packaging. We have been making necessary effort and are continually reviewing our operations for compliance with applicable laws. Though costs for environmental compliance could be costly, we do not expect such compliance to have a material impact on our business or a material financial effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Our Corporate History
We are innovation leaders in mobile tech accessories for smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile technology. For over 10 years, we have developed creative product solutions that enhance and protect mobile devices for consumers around the world. We have an award-winning product portfolio that includes screen protection, power cases, power management, wireless charging, audio, mobile keyboards, protective cases, and other mobile accessories sold under the ZAGG, InvisibleShield, mophie, IFROGZ, BRAVEN, Gear4, and HALO brands.
In June 2011, we acquired IFROGZ, an audio company, which expanded our product lines beyond screen protection and keyboards.

Seasonal Business
We have historically been positively impacted near the time of major device launches by Apple, Samsung, and other device manufacturers, particularly when there is a change in form factor. We expect major device launches to continue to positively impact our operations during 2020 and beyond. Further, as our products are sold through traditional retail, online, and through home shopping channels, we experience a natural uplift during the fourth quarter due to the holidays.
