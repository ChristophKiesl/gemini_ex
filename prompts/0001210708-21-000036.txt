ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
    Hudson Global, Inc. (the “Company” or “Hudson”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) is a leading total talent solutions provider operating under the brand name Hudson RPO. We deliver innovative, customized recruitment outsourcing and total talent solutions to organizations worldwide. Through our consultative approach, we develop tailored talent solutions designed to meet our clients’ strategic growth initiatives. We are a Delaware corporation, and have operated as an independent publicly held company since April 1, 2003 when Monster Worldwide, Inc., formerly TMP Worldwide, Inc., spun off its eResourcing division.
Prior to the second quarter of 2018, the Company’s core service offerings included Permanent Recruitment, Contracting, and Talent Management Solutions (collectively, Recruitment and Talent Management or “RTM”), as well as Recruitment Process Outsourcing (“RPO”). On March 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of all of its RTM businesses in three separate transactions and retained its RPO business and contracting services provided to RPO clients (the “Sales Transaction”). The RTM businesses met the criteria for discontinued operations. The Company reclassified its discontinued operations for all periods presented and has excluded the results of its discontinued operations from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented.    
The Company delivers RPO recruitment and Contracting solutions tailored to the individual needs of primarily mid-to-large-cap multinational companies. The Company’s RPO delivery teams utilize state-of-the-art recruitment process methodologies and project management expertise in their flexible, turnkey solutions to meet clients’ ongoing business needs. The Company’s RPO services include complete recruitment outsourcing, project-based outsourcing, contingent workforce solutions, and recruitment consulting. Hudson operates directly in twelve countries with three reportable geographic business segments: Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe. 
On October 1, 2020, Hudson completed its acquisition of Coit Staffing, Inc., which expanded its presence in the technology sector and established a Technology Group located in San Francisco. The Technology Group operates jointly with Hudson RPO’s existing teams in the Americas, Asia Pacific, and in Europe, to provide continuous access to knowledge regarding new and emerging technologies in the RPO, Managed Solutions Provider ("MSP"), and Total Talent Solutions space, enabling the Company to better serve its clients around the world. The Technology Group also leverages its network and partnerships within the technology sector to seek out new customers and opportunities in other markets around the world.
    For the year ended December 31, 2020, the amounts and percentages of the Company’s total revenue from the three reportable segments were as follows: 

 | Revenue
$ in thousands | Amount | | Percentage
Americas | $ | 10,866 | | | 10.7 | %
Asia Pacific | 75,633 | | | 74.6 | % 
Europe | 14,949 | | | 14.7 | % 
Total | $ | 101,448 | | | 100.0 | %

    The Company’s core service offering is RPO, consisting of RPO Recruitment and Contracting:
    RPO Recruitment: The Company provides complete recruitment outsourcing, project-based outsourcing, and recruitment consulting for clients’ permanent staff hires. Hudson’s RPO Recruitment services leverage the Company’s consultants, supported by the Company’s specialists, in the delivery of its proprietary methods to identify, select, and engage the best-fit talent for critical client roles. 
    Contracting: The Company provides RPO clients with a range of outsourced professional contract staffing services and managed service provider services offered sometimes on a standalone basis and sometimes as part of a blended total talent solution. These services draw upon a combination of specialized recruiting and project management competencies to deliver a wide range of solutions. Hudson-employed professionals - either individually or as a team - are placed with client organizations for a defined period of time based on specific business needs of the client.

Sales and Marketing
    The Company’s employees include approximately 330 client-facing consultants who sell and deliver its RPO services to its existing client base. The Company’s consultant population has deep expertise in specific functional areas and industry sectors, and provides broad-based recruitment and solution services based on the needs of each client on a regional and global basis.
Competition
    The markets for the Company’s services and products are highly competitive. There are few barriers to entry, so new entrants occur frequently, resulting in considerable market fragmentation. Companies in this industry compete on a number of parameters including degree and quality of candidate and position knowledge, industry expertise, global presence, scalability, service quality, and efficiency in completing assignments. Typically, companies with greater strength or scale in these parameters garner higher margins.
Growth Strategy
    We focus on organically growing our RPO business, reducing overhead, and pursuing acquisition opportunities. We target driving organic growth in RPO by investing in people and technology to leverage our existing strong reputation in the market. We are driving down corporate and regional overhead by reducing complexity left over following the Sales Transaction. We are investigating acquisition opportunities to expand capabilities and capacity and utilize our net operating losses.  We continue to explore all strategic alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, including without limitation, improving the market position and profitability of our services in the marketplace, and enhancing our valuation. We may pursue our goals through organic growth, strategic initiatives, or other alternatives. We will also continue to monitor capital markets for opportunities to repurchase shares, and consider other actions designed to enhance shareholder value, as well as review information regarding potential acquisitions and provide information to third parties, from time to time.
