ITEM 1. BUSINESS



We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. We have not selected any potential business combination target.



On March 23, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 25,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units offered in the Initial Public Offering, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $250.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $14.3 million, of which approximately $8.8 million was for deferred underwriting commissions. On April 16, 2021, the underwriters notified the Company of their partial exercise of the over-allotment option and, on April 20, 2021, purchased 2,254,262 additional Units (the “Additional Units”), generating gross proceeds of approximately $22.5 million (the “Over-Allotment”). The Company incurred additional offering costs of approximately $1.2 million in connection with the Over-Allotment (of which approximately $789,000 was for deferred underwriting fees).



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 810,000 units (each, a “Private Placement Unit” and collectively, the “Private Placement Units”), at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $8.1 million. Simultaneously with the closing of the Over-Allotment on April 20, 2021, the Company consummated the second closing of the Private Placement, resulting in the purchase of an aggregate of an additional 45,085 Private Placement Units at $10.00 per additional Private Placement Unit (the “Additional Private Placement Units”), generating additional gross proceeds of approximately $451,000.



Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, Over-Allotment, and the Private Placement, $272.5 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.




The Company is an affiliate of Glenfarne Group, LLC (“Glenfarne”). We will seek to capitalize on the significant experience and business network of our management team, led by Brendan Duval, in consummating an initial business combination. Although we may pursue an initial business combination in any business, industry or geographic location, we currently intend to focus on companies that provide value-accretive opportunities in the Energy Transition & Electrification (“ET&E”) sector in the Americas. We intend to evaluate both private and public companies as potential targets, focusing on opportunities that we believe present the potential for an appropriate risk-adjusted return profile for stockholders. Our objective is to generate an attractive return for our stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our efforts in identifying a prospective target company or business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region.



Founded in 2011 by Mr. Duval, Glenfarne is a privately held energy and infrastructure development and management firm based in New York City and Houston, with more than 450 team members across the Americas as of December 31, 2020. Glenfarne, directly or through its affiliates, has a U.S. office in Dallas, and Central and South American offices in Panama City, Panama, Santiago, Chile, Bogota, Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, and Barranquilla, Colombia. Glenfarne’s seasoned executives, asset managers, and operators develop, acquire, manage and operate energy and infrastructure assets throughout North and South America. Since its founding, Glenfarne has been active at the forefront of the global energy transition, supporting widespread access to sustainable, low cost, and clean power. Glenfarne currently has two operating affiliates: EnfraGen and Alder Midstream. EnfraGen is a developer, owner, and operator of grid stability and value-added renewable energy infrastructure businesses across Latin American investment-grade countries. The business includes approximately 1.9 GW of power generation assets either in operation or construction. The business is diversified across both grid stability thermal and renewable technologies with operations in multiple geographies. The business’s strategy focuses on (a) the provision of essential grid stability services through its Prime Energia division, and (b) the generation of renewable energy through its Fontus division both of which support the global energy transition and the electrification of end markets. Alder is focused on building, owning and operating midstream assets and associated infrastructure, with a primary focus on the provision of natural gas to support gas-to-power opportunities globally. Alder includes IACX Energy, LLC a natural gas gathering & processing business featuring six processing plants and approximately 5,000 miles of gathering pipeline in the U.S. Alder and Glenfarne also control two late-stage LNG export development projects in the U.S.: Texas LNG, a 4 mtpa project in Brownsville, Texas, and Magnolia LNG, an 8.8 mtpa project in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Through its ownership of Texas LNG and Magnolia LNG, Glenfarne’s aggregated FERC-approved development-stage LNG export capacity is approximately 13 mtpa.

Glenfarne has built a strong reputation and a successful track record since its inception. Through Glenfarne’s platform-building acquisitions with EnfraGen and Alder, Glenfarne has demonstrated its ability to identify, structure and close unique acquisition opportunities across a range of different assets and subsequently scale these portfolios into large businesses. This approach to business-building has allowed Glenfarne to generate robust deal flow and to partner with a range of debt, equity and hybrid investors, both public and private, and lenders across numerous transactions. In doing so, Glenfarne has cultivated deep industry relationships throughout the energy transition value chain, including providers of equipment, services and technology. We believe that with Glenfarne’s, support GGMC will be positioned as a preferred potential partner for a business combination.



With respect to the foregoing examples, past experience or performance of our management team and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (i) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (ii) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance. Our management team and their respective affiliates have been involved with a large number of public and private companies in addition to those identified above, not all of which have achieved similar performance levels. See “Risk Factors — Past performance by our management team or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.” No member of our management team has any experience in operating special purpose acquisition companies.



Business Strategy



Our business strategy is to target, identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, grow a business in the Energy Transition & Electrification sector in the Americas. Energy Transition & Electrification represents the global mission to provide widespread access to sustainable, low cost and clean power. ET&E plays a critical role in global decarbonization and “net-zero” efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and targeting ESG objectives for investors and consumers alike. According to Morgan Stanley, the rising level of emissions generated by industrialization and the burning of fossil fuels has driven climate change and global warming to a point where livelihoods, the environment, and the economy are experiencing significant disruption and damage. Climate change could intensify extreme weather events, enhance the risk of mass migration and disease, and lead to economic losses of up to 7% of global GDP over the long run. The primary ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are expected to include the advancement and expansion of renewable power generation, energy storage, electric vehicles, the use of hydrogen as a fuel source, carbon capture & storage, and renewable fuels. In recent years, advancements have been made on this front: according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, in 2018, there was a 6.1% increase in electricity generated from renewables compared to 2017, and renewables are expected to grow from approximately 25% of electricity generation today to 75% by 2050, according to a 2019 report by McKinsey. However, the global energy transition necessitates the continued deployment of additional capital, both human and financial, to support business models and technologies to meet forecast targets. We believe the following sectors within the ET&E space represent significant market opportunities, expected to require at least $50 trillion in capital expenditures over the next 30 years based on data from Bloomberg and Morgan Stanley, which GGMC is well positioned to address:

● | Renewable Power: Renewable power is expected to be the primary enabler to reduce carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. Morgan Stanley expects up to $14 trillion of new investment through 2050 to increase renewable power capacity by 11,000 GW to meet targets outlined by the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change. Significant infrastructure additions of wind, solar and hydropower plants are expected to be needed, leading to renewables ultimately representing the majority of electricity generation by 2050. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grid Infrastructure & Energy Storage: A substantial investment in grid infrastructure (transmission and distribution) will be required to accommodate this new renewable power capacity expansion and to broaden access to clean power. Energy storage is expected to serve an increasingly important role to provide grid stability and support daily supply and demand imbalances with the advancement of inherently intermittent renewable resources. Renewable power paired with energy storage solutions mitigates intermittency-related issues and may ultimately allow renewables to compete with and displace conventional power generation in the provision of firm capacity. Technological innovation and declining costs have allowed energy storage solutions to become incorporated more easily into existing and new transmission and distribution infrastructure. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Electric Vehicles and Related Infrastructure: The electrification of the vehicle fleet and autonomous driving reflect the increasing transformation of the transportation sector by software, technology and growing demand for low-carbon mobility. According to Morgan Stanley, this presents an $11 trillion capital investment opportunity to support the electrification of road transportation. The opportunity includes the manufacture of batteries, equipment, and components, as well as additional electricity storage. The expansion of charging infrastructure can support the increased penetration of electric vehicles. Additional renewable power generation capacity will also be required to help power electric vehicles become fundamentally low-carbon mobility solutions. Morgan Stanley estimates this will require up to another 12,000 GW of incremental renewable power generation capacity by 2050. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hydrogen: As a longer-term solution, hydrogen provides additional opportunities to reduce carbon emissions. It can potentially reduce emissions from industrial processes (energy, petrochemicals, mining, food production), transportation (light vehicles, buses, trucks, ships) and serve as a potential replacement for natural gas in power generation and heating. Furthermore, the ability to generate “green” hydrogen from renewable sources of power supports hydrogen in becoming a low-carbon solution. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that these evolving industry dynamics, among others, create meaningful opportunities to support businesses focused on ET&E, and that GGMC is well-positioned to acquire and develop a business in the ET&E sector. Through its business-building experiences at EnfraGen and Alder, Glenfarne has demonstrated its ability to deploy human capital and financial capital to support the execution of strategic, operational and financial initiatives in a business plan. We also believe Glenfarne has demonstrated an ability to raise and deploy capital from a variety of equity and debt providers in support of its investment theses. We believe Glenfarne’s history demonstrates that the management team is well-positioned to achieve its objective.



Since the completion of the Initial Public Offering, our founders have been communicating with their network of relationships to articulate the parameters of our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities. We focus our efforts on opportunities where we believe we have a competitive advantage and are best situated to enhance the value of the business after completion of the initial business combination. The ultimate goal of this business strategy is to maximize stockholder value.



We believe we can source and complete a business combination that will benefit from our industry expertise, our transactional and capital markets capabilities, and our hands-on approach to value creation. More specifically:




● | Seasoned Management Team: The management team brings a collective 90+ years of experience in the energy & infrastructure value chain with a strong track record in the energy transition space. The core management team has worked together since 2015 and has jointly worked on launching two business units (EnfraGen and Alder). Before their tenures at Glenfarne, each member of the management team has had extensive careers in infrastructure, including energy transition-related projects, highlighted by Mr. Duval’s 14-year history with Macquarie Group and helping build out Macquarie’s Americas infrastructure platform. We believe the depth of experience within the management team positions the business well for finding an attractive potential business combination target. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deal Sourcing: We believe that our management team, headlined by Mr. Duval, will be viewed positively in the industry and will allow the team to generate a wide array of merger, acquisition and investment opportunities. The management team, supported by the investment team at Glenfarne, has successfully sourced and closed acquisitions in a variety of different transaction contexts. The management team over the past several years has developed a disciplined and methodical approach to sourcing and screening transactions, which we believe will allow the team to pursue numerous potential transactions and increase the likelihood of a successful business combination. The management team will be supported by a highly accomplished Board of directors whose network, experience and expertise will strengthen the deal sourcing and screening function. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industry Veterans: As long-term investors, owners and operators of a wide range of infrastructure assets, the management team has cultivated a wide network of industry relationships with senior executives, management teams, consultants, advisors, financiers and intermediaries. We believe the management team’s industry expertise provides a level of credibility and visibility that will be viewed positively by the industry, creating new pathways for sourcing deals and identifying value accretive opportunities. The management team has also recruited a highly accomplished Board of Directors who can generate additional deal flow with their network of contacts. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Transactional and Capital Markets Capabilities: The management team has over US$20 billion in combined transactional experience. The management team has an extensive track record of sourcing, screening, financing and closing acquisitions across multiple geographies (principally in the Americas), sectors (principally power, energy, transportation and logistics) and industry and economic cycles. The management team has a demonstrated expertise in raising both debt and equity capital and a strong understanding of the capital markets, both at Glenfarne and at prior businesses. These capabilities combined enhance the management team’s ability to deliver a fundamentally attractive acquisition opportunity with a capital structure that increases value for public stockholders. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hands-On Approach to Value Creation: The management team has proven capabilities in creating value for stockholders through strategic, operational or financial means. This includes driving revenue growth and profitability, enhancing operating efficiencies and improving capital allocation decisions for organic growth. We believe these capabilities also permit the management team to identify and evaluate potential risks and structure solutions to mitigate risk. These capabilities allow the management team to pursue differentiated approaches when screening acquisition opportunities and underwriting investment theses to unlock unrealized value.

Acquisition Criteria



The management team has identified the following transaction screening criteria which we believe will be important in evaluating prospective targets. These criteria will act as important guidelines and guideposts as the management team screens for, identifies and evaluates acquisition opportunities; however, the management team may elect to pursue a transaction which does not meet these criteria. We believe an attractive target business:

● | Can leverage the extensive relationships and networks our management team has built across the energy and infrastructure value chain;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Can benefit from the strategic insights and guidance provided by the management team about Energy Transition & Electrification, as well as the management team’s proven ability to implement strategic initiatives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Can benefit from the management team’s technical skills in enhancing operations, optimizing costs or incorporating innovative solutions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Can benefit from the management team’s capability to drive growth through M&A or organic growth initiatives;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Can benefit from the management team’s ability to optimize capital structures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Will have an attractive risk profile, underpinned by well-defined cashflows, strong backlog of new investment opportunities, a broad addressable target market, and appropriate leverage;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return profile for our stockholders; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Will be well received by public investors and are expected to have good access to the public capital markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The management team intends to target an enterprise value of up to $2.0 billion for the pro-forma business combination, as determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation methodologies. The management team believes that this focus on the middle market will provide the greatest number of opportunities for evaluation while capitalizing on the management team’s prior experience in the sector. These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.



In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.



Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience.



Each of our directors and officers, directly or indirectly, has a beneficial interest in founder shares and/or private placement units following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.





6







Certain of our officers and directors may currently or in the future have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity, including any such opportunity where a majority of the projected stabilized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization related to such opportunity would be reasonably expected to be generated by power plants, power storage facilities, grid stability assets and other infrastructure assets ancillary to or associated with such plants, facilities and assets within any country in Latin America that has an “investment grade” rating from at least two major credit rating agencies. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to such officer’s and director’s fiduciary duties under Delaware law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which Glenfarne or an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation or ownership interest. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the business combination by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any business combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.



Our Sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, our founders, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.



Initial Business Combination



In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, including but not limited to an Affiliated Joint Acquisition, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.



Other Considerations



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.



We currently do not have any specific business combination under consideration. Our management team is regularly made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination.



In addition, certain of our founders, officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities. As a result, if any of our founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any business combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.



Our Sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, our founders, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.



Status as a Public Company



We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.





8







Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.



While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.



Financial Position



With funds available for a business combination from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units initially in the amount of $262,911,000, after payment of the estimated expenses of the Initial Public Offering and $9,589,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting our Initial Business Combination



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the Initial Public Offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the private placements of the private placement units, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.



We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.

Sources of Target Businesses



Our process of identifying acquisition targets leverages our sponsor and our management team’s industry experiences, proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad and deep network of relationships in numerous industries, including executives and management teams, private equity groups and other institutional investors, large business enterprises, lenders, investment bankers and other investment market participants, restructuring advisers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We expect that the collective experience, capability and network of our founders, our directors and officers, combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, will help to create prospective business combination opportunities.



In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Annual Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions.



We also expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated acquisition of such target by us.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.



Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue a business combination opportunity jointly with one or more entities affiliated with Glenfarne and/or one or more investors in funds or separate accounts managed by Glenfarne, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition,” with an entity to which Glenfarne or an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the business combination by making a specified future issuance to any such entity.





10







Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination



Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test.



To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.



Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.





11







Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination



We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.



Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:




● | we issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our shares of common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq’ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:




● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities



If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.



Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgment that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.



The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.



In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A common stock or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.



There is no limit on the number of public shares and public warrants that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may purchase pursuant to the transactions described above.



Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of our Class A common stock) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.



Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.





13







Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, directors and each member of our management team have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering.
Limitations on Redemptions



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout firms, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees



We currently have five executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.

Our Website



Our corporate website address is www.glenfarnemerger.com. The information contained on, or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the completion of our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the Market Value of the shares of our Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
