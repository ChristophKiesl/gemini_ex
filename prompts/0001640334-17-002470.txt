ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
We were incorporated in Colorado on June 21, 2010. Between February 1, 2011 and June 14, 2014 we were involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties in southeast Texas.
 
We were never able to earn a profit and in January of 2013 we began investigating the possibility of selling our oil and gas properties. 
 
On June 17, 2014 we sold our oil and gas properties to Vast Exploration, Inc.. 
 
The sale of our oil and gas properties represented the sale of substantially all of our assets.
 
On August 19, 2014, a 100-for-1 reverse split of our common stock became effective.
 
Subsequent Events
 
On July 1, 2017 the Company authorized an increase in its authorized common shares to 500,000,000 and its authorized preferred shares to 10,000,000.
 
On July 1, 2017 the company acquired all of the shares of Solar Quartz Technologies Limited, a company incorporated in New Zealand (“SQTNZ”). These shares were purchased from Solar Quartz Technologies, Inc. (“SQTI”). We subsequently changed our name to Solar Quartz Technologies Corporation in Colorado and with FINRA, and have also been cleared by FINRA to use the new trading symbol SQTX. The Company issued 213,402,755 new shares of common stock to SQTI in exchange for 122 (100%) of the common shares of SQTNZ. The issuance of these shares was equivalent to 95% of the Company's shares issued, after we issue an additional 10,021,224 shares of common stock to those holders of our common stock immediately prior to the acquisition. The Company does not anticipate any further reorganization of its common stock. We are currently preparing filing all necessary reports to the SEC with audited financial statements to resume our status as fully reporting with the SEC, and subsequently apply to trade on the more senior OTCQX exchange or NASDAQ.
 
SQTNZ is a corporation that has had no prior business activity other than being the title owner of the exclusive mining and development rights for two High Purity Quartz (HPQ) Silica deposits known as Quartz Hill (represented by leases ML 30235, ML 30236 and ML 30237) and White Springs (represented by leases ML 30238 and ML 30239) located in North Queensland, Australia. Together they contain deposits in excess of 15 million tons of 99% pure High Purity Quartz which is feedstock in high demand in the marketplace to be used in the production of High Purity Quartz Sand (HPQS) according to independent professional reports.
