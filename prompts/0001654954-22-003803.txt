ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General

MobileSmith, Inc. (referred to herein as, “MobileSmith,” the “Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in August 1993 and became a public company through a self-registration in February 2005.
Principal Products and Services

MobileSmith is a developer of software applications for the healthcare industry. Our software products include a cloud-based collection of applications that run on our architected healthcare technology ecosystem. The architecture is designed to do the following:

· | improve experience of healthcare patients and consumers, who are often at the same time members of various medical insurance networks 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | increase adoption, utilization and intelligence of EMRs (electronic medical records), extend EMR’s usability to patients and consumers of healthcare.


Since 2013 the Company focused exclusively on the development of do-it-yourself customer facing platform that enabled organizations to rapidly create, deploy, and manage custom, native smartphone and tablet apps deliverable across iOS and Android mobile platforms without writing a single line of code. 

During 2017 the Company concluded that it had its highest rate of success with clients within the Healthcare industry and concentrated its development and sales and marketing efforts in that industry. During 2018 we further refined our Healthcare offering and redefined our product - a suite of e-health mobile solutions that consist of a catalog of ready to deploy mobile app solutions (App Blueprints) and support services. In 2019 and 2020 we consolidated our current solutions under a single offering branded Peri™. Peri™ is a cloud-based collection of applications that run of our architected healthcare technology ecosystem. Peri™ is designed to bridge the gap between healthcare industry system tools and healthcare consumer while using our proprietary platform behind apps placed on consumer’s mobile device.

During 2021 we advanced our flagship PeriOp offering to be market ready. PeriOp is an EMR integrated mobile app based set of pre and postoperative instructions (which we refer to as Clinical Pathways), that establishes a direct two-way clinical procedure management process between a patient and a healthcare provider and, by doing so, improves patient engagement and procedural adherence and also removes manual paper based pre and post procedural processes. PeriOp digitizes and streamlines for both patients and providers “the last mile of healthcare delivery” between scheduled procedure and day of surgery with emphasis on patient’s readiness. PeriOp digitizes and streamlines “the first mile” of post-surgery recovery journey with a focus on maintaining positive surgical outcomes and avoidance of readmissions.

Target Market and Sales Channels

During 2017 we completed a strategic shift and focused our business and research and development activities primarily on the Healthcare industry in the United States.

In 2018 we refined our healthcare focus by identifying two target markets: (i) healthcare providers (including hospitals, hospital systems and the United States Veterans Health Administration) and (ii) healthcare payer market (including insurance companies and insurance brokers).

In 2021 we further refined our focus within the healthcare providers. We concentrated our efforts on hospital systems with large employed physician groups who use either Cerner or Epic Systems as their primary EMRs (electronic medical records). Additionally we are investigating ambulatory surgery centers (ASC) market for feasibility.

Both markets are targeted with a diversified sales workforce that includes direct sales and resellers, such as channel partners. 

Principal Customers

Our principal customers are hospitals in the United States. We don’t have significant concentrations of relationship with any single customer.

Research and Development

During 2017 and 2018 we focused our technological and design efforts on our Blueprint features, that dominated our offering to healthcare providers in 2019 (Blueprint is a fully customizable pre-built app targeting specific healthcare related business function or health condition).

During 2019 we invested heavily in development of our Peri™ solution, which was introduced to the market during that year and in 2020 we continued to refine the product and add features. During 2021 we advanced our flagship PeriOp offering to be market ready. We continuously invest in new features and security of our products.

Competition

We have been successful in penetrating the healthcare provider technology market and developed extensive expertise in the industry. With many of our customers we enjoy five-plus year relationships. However, the healthcare provider technology industry is highly competitive. Our competitors range from successful established companies to emerging start-ups. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial, personnel, and other resources than we do. Moreover, more companies enter the industry and market every year. As a result of this, we expect the competition we face to grow stronger in the next five years. The market for our and similar products is highly fragmented. No leader has yet emerged in the area of pre and post-surgery process optimization through application of mobile technology.
Intellectual Property

During 2014, we stopped pursuing the majority of our patent applications as we determined that the cost of pursuing them is greater than the potential protection provided by them. Since then we have been granted one patent associated with our technology.

We also have several trademarks registered and pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These trademarks cover certain brand names of our offerings.

Employees

As of December 31, 2021, we had 24 full time employees and no part-time employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
