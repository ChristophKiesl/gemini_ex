Development of the Company
Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE: APTS) is a real estate investment trust engaged primarily in the ownership and operation of Class A multifamily properties, with select investments in grocery anchored shopping centers, Class A office buildings, and student housing properties. Preferred Apartment Communities’ investment objective is to generate attractive, stable returns for stockholders by investing in income-producing properties and acquiring or originating real estate loans. As of December 31, 2019, we owned or were invested in 123 properties in 15 states, predominantly in the Southeast region of the United States.

As referred to herein, the Sixth Amended and Restated Management Agreement, effective as of June 3, 2016, among the Company, our Operating Partnership and Preferred Apartment Advisors, LLC, or our Manager, is referred to as the Management Agreement. 
On January 31, 2020, we internalized the functions performed by our Manager and NMP Advisors, LLC (the "Sub-Manager") by acquiring the entities that own the Manager and the Sub-Manager (such transactions, collectively, the "Internalization"). The Internalization resulted in the elimination of the previous fee structure between us and the Manager, including acquisition and other fees. All managerial and administrative personnel our Manager and Sub-Manager provided to us pursuant to the Management Agreement became employees of the Company effective with the closing of the Internalization. Trusts established, or entities owned, by the family of John A. Williams, the Company’s former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel M. DuPree, the Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board and former Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Leonard A. Silverstein, the Company’s Vice Chairman of the Board, and former President and Chief Operating Officer, were the owners of NELL. Trusts established, or entities owned, by Joel T. Murphy, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board, the family of Mr. Williams, Mr. DuPree and Mr. Silverstein were the owners of NMA. As of February 25, 2020, the Company had 502 employees.
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Operating Partnership. The Company controls the Operating Partnership through its sole general partnership interest and prior to internalizing conducted substantially all its business through the Operating Partnership. Following Internalization, the Company plans to conduct substantially all of its business through PAC Carveout, LLC, or Carveout, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company held an approximate 98.1% weighted average ownership percentage in the Operating Partnership. 
Our Operating Partnership and Carveout are related parties to us. 
At December 31, 2019, our portfolio of owned real estate assets and potential additions from purchase options we held from our real estate loan investments consisted of:

We operate within the following five operating segments:
Multifamily Communities - consists of our portfolio of residential multifamily communities.
Student Housing Properties - consists of our portfolio of student housing properties.
Financing - consists of our portfolio of real estate loans, bridge loans, and other instruments deployed by us to partially finance the development, construction, and prestabilization carrying costs of new multifamily communities and other real estate and real estate related assets. Excluded from the financing segment are consolidated assets of VIEs and financial results of our Dawson Marketplace grocery-anchored shopping center real estate loan, which are included in the New Market Properties segment.

Investment Strategy
We seek to maximize returns for our stockholders by employing efficient management techniques to grow income and create asset value. Our investment strategies may include, without limitation, the following: 
3


• | Acquiring Class “A” multifamily assets in performing and stable markets throughout the United States; these properties, we believe, will generate sustainable and growing cash flow from operations sufficient to allow us to cover the dividends that we expect to declare and pay and which we believe will have the potential for capital appreciation. These multifamily assets will generally be located in metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, with at least one million people which we expect will generate job growth and where we believe new multifamily development of comparable properties is able to be absorbed at attractive rental rates.


• | Acquiring Class “A” multifamily assets that are intended to be financed with longer-term, assumable, fixed-rate debt typically provided by FHA/HUD programs.


• | Acquiring Class “A” multifamily assets that present an opportunity to implement a value-add program whereby the properties can be upgraded or improved physically to better take advantage of the market.


• | Acquiring grocery-anchored shopping centers, typically anchored by one of the market-dominant grocers in that particular market.


• | Acquiring leading Class “A” office properties in high-growth markets across the U.S.


• | Originating real estate loan investments secured by interests in multifamily communities, membership or partnership interests in multifamily communities, other multifamily related assets, grocery-anchored shopping centers and office properties.


• | It is our policy to acquire any of our target assets primarily for income, and only secondarily for possible capital gain. As part of our business strategy, we may enter into forward purchase contracts or purchase options for to-be-built multifamily communities, office buildings and retail centers and we may make real estate related loans, provide deposit arrangements, or provide performance assurances, as may be necessary or appropriate, in connection with the construction of multifamily communities and other properties. 


• | We also may invest in real estate related debt, including, but not limited to, newly or previously originated first mortgage loans on multifamily properties, office buildings and retail centers that meet our investment criteria, which are performing or non-performing, newly or previously originated real estate related loans on multifamily properties that meet our investment criteria (second or subsequent mortgages), which are performing or non-performing, and tranches of securitized loans (pools of collateralized mortgaged-backed securities) on multifamily properties that meet our investment criteria, which are performing or non-performing. In connection with our investments in real estate related debt, we may negotiate the inclusion of exclusive purchase options on the to-be-developed properties. These purchase options may include a fixed purchase price set at the time we enter into the loan, or a purchase price which is calculated as a certain discount from market capitalization rates at the date of exercise of such purchase option. Certain of the purchase options we hold may be settled by cash payments to us in the event we elect not to acquire the underlying property.

Any asset acquisitions from affiliated third parties have been, and will continue to be, subject to approval by our conflicts committee comprised solely of independent directors. Management will periodically review our investment portfolio and its compliance with our investment guidelines and policies, and provide our board of directors an investment report at the end of each quarter in conjunction with its review of our quarterly results. Our investment guidelines, the assets in our portfolio, the decision to utilize leverage, and the appropriate levels of leverage are periodically reviewed by our board of directors as part of their oversight of us. Our board of directors may amend or revise our investment guidelines without a vote of the stockholders. 
Financing Strategy
We intend to finance the acquisition of investments using various sources of capital, as described in the section entitled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Included in this discussion are details regarding (i) our offering of up to a maximum of 1,000,000 shares of Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series M1 Redeemable Preferred Stock or a combination of both (the "Series A1/M1 Offering") and (ii) our offering of up to $400 million of equity or debt securities (the "2019 Shelf Offering"), including an offering of up to $125 million of Common Stock from time to time in an "at the market" offering (the "2019 ATM Offering"). Our Series A1/M1 Offering was declared effective on September 27, 2019. The Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or Series A Preferred Stock; Series M Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or mShares, Series A1 Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or Series A1 Preferred Stock, and Series M1 Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or Series M1 Preferred Stock are collectively referred to as our Preferred Stock.

We intend to utilize leverage in making our investments. The number of different investments we will acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including the amount of funds available to us. By operating on a leveraged basis, we will have more funds available for our investments. This will allow us to make more investments than would otherwise be possible, resulting in a larger and more diversified portfolio. See the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the risks related to operating on a leveraged basis. 
We generally intend to target leverage levels (secured and unsecured) between 50% and 65% of the fair market value of our tangible assets (including our real estate assets, real estate loans, notes receivable, accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents) on a portfolio basis. As of December 31, 2019, our outstanding debt (both secured and unsecured) was approximately 51.2% of the value of our tangible assets on a portfolio basis based on our estimates of fair market value at December 31, 2019. Neither our charter nor our by-laws contain any limitation on the amount of leverage we may use. These targets, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. The amount of leverage we will place on particular investments will depend on our assessment of a variety of factors which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in the portfolio, the availability and cost of financing the asset, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy and the health of the commercial real estate market in general. In addition, factors such as our outlook on interest rates, changes in the yield curve slope, the level and volatility of interest rates and their associated credit spreads, the underlying collateral of our assets and our outlook on credit spreads relative to our outlook on interest rate and economic performance could all impact our decision and strategy for financing the target assets. At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the investment cost for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value. However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits. Finally, we intend to acquire all our properties through separate single purpose entities and intend to finance each of these properties using debt financing techniques for that property alone, without any cross-collateralization to our other properties or any guarantees by us or our Operating Partnership. We have an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or Credit Facility, with Key Bank, N.A., or Key Bank. The Credit Facility provides for our $200.0 million revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Line of Credit. The Credit Facility requires that we adhere to certain covenants regarding our revolving line of credit, as described in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Other than with regard to our Credit Facility and interim term loan, as of December 31, 2019, we held no debt at the Company or operating partnership levels, had no cross-collateralization of our real estate mortgages, and had no contingent liabilities at the Company or operating partnership levels with regard to our secured mortgage debt on our properties. 
Leverage may be obtained from a variety of sources, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), commercial banks, credit companies, the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), a unit of the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), insurance companies, pension funds, endowments, financial services companies and other institutions who wish to provide debt financing for our assets. 
Our secured and unsecured aggregate borrowings are intended by us to be reasonable in relation to our net assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. In determining whether our borrowings are reasonable in relation to our net assets, we expect that our board of directors will consider many factors, including the lending standards of government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other companies for loans in connection with the financing of multifamily properties, the leverage ratios of publicly traded and non-traded REITs with similar investment strategies, whether we have positive leverage (in that, the board of directors will compare the capitalization rates of our properties to the interest rates on the indebtedness of such properties) and general market and economic conditions. There is no limitation on the amount that we may borrow for any single investment or the number of mortgages that may be placed on any one property.
Branding Strategy
We brand, and intend to brand, all multifamily communities owned by us as “A Preferred Apartment Community” which we believe signifies outstanding brand and management standards, and have obtained all rights to the trademarks, including federal registration of the trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, to secure such brand in connection with such branding. We believe these campaigns will enhance each individual property's presence in relation to other properties within that marketplace.
We acquired all the trademarks owned by our Manager in connection with the closing of the Internalization transaction on January 31, 2020.

Environmental Regulation
We are subject to regulation at the federal, state and municipal levels and are at risk for potential liability should conditions at our properties or our actions or inaction result in damage to the environment or to persons or properties. These conditions could include the potential presence or growth of mold, potential leaks from current or former underground or above-ground storage tanks, breakage or leaks from sewer lines and risks pertaining to the management or disposal of wastes and chemicals. We could be liable for the potential costs of compliance, property damage, restoration and other costs which could occur without regard to our fault or knowledge of such conditions. 
In the course of acquiring and owning real estate assets, we typically engage an independent environmental consulting firm to perform a phase I environmental assessment (and if appropriate, a phase II assessment) to identify and mitigate these risks as part of our due diligence process. We believe these assessment reports provide a reasonable basis for discovery of potential adverse environmental conditions prior to acquisition. If any potential environmental risks or conditions are discovered during our due diligence process, the potential costs of remediation are assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition, assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and reasonable. Some risks or conditions may be identified that are significant enough to cause us to abandon the possibility of acquiring a given property. As of December 31, 2019, we have no knowledge of any material claims made or pending against us with regard to environmental matters for which we could be found liable, nor are we aware of any potential hazards to the environment related to any of our properties which could reasonably be expected to cause us to incur material expenditures.
Competition
The multifamily housing industry is highly fragmented and we compete for residents with a large number of other quality multifamily communities in our target markets which are owned by public and private companies, including other REITs, many of which are larger and have more resources than our Company. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular market could adversely affect our ability to lease our multifamily communities, as well as the rents we are able to charge. In addition, other forms of residential properties, including single family housing and town homes, provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities. The factors on which we focus to compete for residents in our multifamily communities include our high level of resident service, the quality of our apartment communities (including our landscaping and amenity offerings), and the desirability of our locations. Resident leases at our apartment communities are priced competitively based on levels of supply and demand within our target markets and we believe our communities offer a compelling value to prospective residents. 
Similarly, competition for tenants and acquisition of existing centers in the grocery-anchored shopping center sector in our target markets is considerable, consisting of public and private companies, pension funds, high net worth individuals and family offices. In addition, a significant competitor in this sector are some of the grocery anchors themselves as they acquire land and build their own stores or acquire the entire center where they are the anchor. We are faced with the challenge of maintaining high occupancy rates with a financially stable tenant base. In order to attract quality prospective tenants and retain current tenants upon expiration of their leases, we focus on improving the design and visibility of our centers, building strong relationships with our tenants, and reducing excess operating costs and increasing tenant satisfaction through proactive asset and property management. We target acquisitions in markets with solid surrounding demographics, quality underlying real estate locations, and centers where our asset management approach can provide an environment conducive to creating sales productivity for our tenants.
We compete with other primarily institutional-quality owners and investors in the business of acquiring, investing to develop, leasing and operating office properties. We leverage relationships, track record, and the high quality of our physical assets and locations to compete successfully. Additional principal factors of competition are the leasing terms (including rental rates and concessions or allowances offered) and the terms of any other investment activity such as real estate loan investments in new development. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.
