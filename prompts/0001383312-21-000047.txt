ITEM 1.    Business
Overview
Broadridge, a Delaware corporation and a part of the S&P 500® Index (“S&P”), is a global financial technology leader providing investor communications and technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers, asset and wealth managers and corporate issuers. With over 50 years of experience, including over 10 years as an independent public company, we provide financial services firms with advanced, dependable, scalable and cost-effective integrated solutions and an important infrastructure that powers the financial services industry. Our solutions enable better financial lives by powering investing, governance and communications and help reduce the need for our clients to make significant capital investments in operations infrastructure, thereby allowing them to increase their focus on core business activities.
We operate our business in two reportable segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations.
Investor Communication Solutions
We provide the following governance and communications solutions through our Investor Communication Solutions business segment: Regulatory Solutions, Data-Driven Fund Solutions, Corporate Issuer Solutions, and Customer Communications Solutions.
A large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business involves the processing and distribution of proxy materials to investors in equity securities and mutual funds, as well as the facilitation of related vote processing. ProxyEdge® (“ProxyEdge”) is our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors that helps ensure the voting participation of the largest stockholders of many companies. We have implemented digital applications to make voting easier for retail investors. We also provide the distribution of regulatory reports, class action and corporate action/reorganization event information, as well as tax reporting solutions that help our clients meet their regulatory compliance needs.
For asset managers and retirement service providers, we offer data-driven solutions and an end-to-end platform for content management, composition, and omni-channel distribution of regulatory, marketing, and transactional information. Our data and analytics solutions provide investment product distribution data, analytical tools, insights, and research to enable asset managers to optimize product distribution across retail and institutional channels globally. Through Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc. (“Matrix”), we provide mutual fund trade processing services for retirement service providers, third-party administrators, financial advisors, banks and wealth management professionals.
In addition, we provide public corporations and mutual funds with a full suite of solutions to help manage their annual meeting process, including registered and beneficial proxy materials distribution, proxy processing and tabulation services, digital voting solutions, proxy and shareholder report document management solutions, virtual shareholder meeting services, and shareholder data services. We also offer financial reporting document composition and management solutions, SEC disclosure and filing services, and registrar, stock transfer and record-keeping services through Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions.
We provide omni-channel customer communications solutions, which include print and digital solutions, to modernize technology infrastructures, simplify communications processes, accelerate digital adoption and improve the customer experience. Through one point of integration, the Broadridge Communications CloudSM platform (the “Communications Cloud”) helps companies create, deliver, and manage their communications and customer engagement. The platform includes data-driven composition tools, identity and preference management, omni-channel optimization and digital communication experience, archive and information management, digital and print delivery, and analytics and reporting tools. 
Global Technology and Operations
We are a leading global provider of business solutions for capital markets and wealth and investment management firms. We offer advanced solutions that automate firms’ transaction lifecycle, from desktop productivity tools, data aggregation, performance reporting, and portfolio management to order capture and execution, trade confirmation, margin, cash management, clearance and settlement, asset servicing, reference data management, reconciliations, securities financing and collateral optimization, compliance and regulatory reporting, and portfolio accounting and custody-related services. In addition, we provide business process outsourcing services (“BPO”) that support the entire trade lifecycle operations of our buy- and sell-side clients’ businesses through a combination of our technology and our operations expertise.
For capital markets firms, we help our clients lower their costs and improve the effectiveness of their businesses across the front, middle and back office. Our core post-trade services help financial institutions efficiently and cost-effectively consolidate their books and records, gather and service assets under management and manage risk, thereby enabling them to focus on their core business activities. Provided on a software as a service (“SaaS”) basis within large user communities, our technology is a global solution, processing clearance and settlement in over 100 countries. Our multi-asset, multi-market, multi-entity and multi-currency solutions support real-time global trade processing of equity, fixed income, mutual fund, foreign exchange, and exchange-traded derivatives. We process on average over $9 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day of United States of America (“U.S.”) and Canadian securities. With the recent acquisition of Itiviti Holding AB (“Itiviti”), we have strengthened our capabilities with a set of front-office trade order and execution management solutions, connectivity and network offerings which will integrate with our existing middle and back-office solutions.
Our comprehensive wealth management platform offers capabilities across the entire wealth management lifecycle and streamlines all aspects of wealth management services, including account management, fee management and client on-boarding. The wealth management platform enables full-service, regional and independent broker-dealers and investment advisors to better engage with customers through digital marketing and customer communications tools. We also integrate data, content and technology to drive new customer acquisition, support holistic and personalized advice and cross-sell opportunities through the creation of sales and educational content, including seminars as well as customizable advisor websites, search engine marketing and electronic and print newsletters. Our advisor solutions help advisors optimize their practice management through customer and account data aggregation and reporting. We currently support over 200,000 professionals at more than 300 financial firms with our wealth management solutions in the U.S. and Canada.
We also offer buy-side technology solutions for the global investment management industry, including portfolio management, compliance and operational workflow solutions for hedge funds, family offices, alternative asset managers, traditional asset managers and the providers that service this space. 
Our Strategy 
We earn our clients’ confidence every day by delivering real business value through leading technology-driven solutions that help our clients get ahead of today’s challenges and capitalize on future growth opportunities. Our solutions harness people, technology and insights to help transform our clients’ businesses by enriching customer engagement, navigating risk, optimizing efficiency and growing revenue.
As financial institutions look to transform and mutualize their mission-critical but non-differentiating operational and support functions, we have the proven technology, scale, innovation, experience and, most importantly, the clients to achieve this goal and meet their needs. We define our market opportunity in our strong and growing global businesses in both governance and capital markets, with an additional growth platform in wealth and investment management. Our growth strategy is based on the following key components.
Our business model.
We deliver multi-client technology and business process outsourcing services primarily through common SaaS-based operations platforms. We increasingly create layers of value by driving network benefits to our clients, providing deep data and analytics solutions, and offering a suite of digital capabilities on a single platform. All of this translates into our core value proposition to be a trusted provider of technology and services across a range of analytical, operational and reporting functions. Our SaaS offerings allow our clients to mutualize development expenses and our solutions integrate global data services to provide globally-consistent insight to functions and requirements within the financial services industry.
Strong positions in a large and growing financial services market.
Our technology and associates power the critical infrastructure behind investing, governance and communications. Broadridge makes our clients stronger, and through them, we enable better financial lives for investors around the globe. Our deep industry knowledge enables our clients to successfully solve complex technological challenges, and inspires trust among and brings novel perspectives to our clients. While financial services firms have historically kept much of their technology infrastructure work in-house, there are two significant trends working in favor of Broadridge. In aggregate, financial service firms globally are spending more on technology, and the respective budgets allocated are consistently growing year-over-year. Moreover, these firms are devoting a growing percentage of this spend to third-party technology, operations, and services. Broadridge, as a trusted outside service provider, can undertake streamlining and better integrate our clients’ infrastructure and processes. We expect the efficiencies that result from such undertaking by Broadridge will lead to growth in the market for our solutions.
Three attractive growth platforms.
Our growth platforms address important and significant client needs as described below. Through our integrated solutions and services and our scalable infrastructure, we believe we are best positioned to meet them.
•Governance. We provide a strong network through our governance platform that links broker-dealers, public companies, mutual funds, shareholders, and regulators. We continue to grow our governance solutions by continuing to transform content and delivery and improve product capabilities to drive higher investor engagement. We aim to be an integral partner to asset managers and retirement service providers by offering data-driven solutions that help them grow revenue, reduce costs and maintain compliance. We are also expanding our capabilities to better serve the needs of issuers and we are driving the next generation of digital communications while optimizing print and mail services through advanced technology.
•Capital Markets. Global institutions have a strong need to simplify their complex technology environment, and our SaaS-based, global, multi-asset-class technology platform addresses this need. As a leader in global trade management, we are driving next-generation solutions that simplify our clients’ operations, improve performance and resiliency, evolve to global operating models, adapt to new technologies, and enable our clients to better manage their data. We plan to continue building on our global platform capabilities, enabling our clients to simplify and improve their global operations across cash securities and other asset classes. Our recent acquisition of Itiviti, for example, allows us to expand our services across the trade lifecycle for equities and exchange-traded derivatives and grow our international reach. We continue to develop component solutions that meet the regulatory, risk, data, and analytics needs of our clients, while also helping to drive more efficient liquidity, price discovery, and improved execution for the firms we serve. 
•Wealth and Investment Management. Wealth and investment management clients, including full-service, regional and independent broker-dealers, investment advisors, insurance companies and retirement solutions providers are all undergoing unprecedented change. These firms are in need of partners to help them navigate the demographic shift of advisors and investors and the aging of the client experience and operational technologies that are essential to their business. These market dynamics are driving the need to more seamlessly integrate technology and processes and the need to access data-centric digital wealth solutions to better service advisors and investors. This can be achieved by simplifying and modernizing their complicated and interwoven legacy systems. We believe these needs have only accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic. To address these demands, we have developed a holistic wealth management platform solution that provides seamless systems and data integration capabilities and enables firms to improve advisor productivity, investor experience and operational process efficiencies.
On-ramp for next-generation technologies.
Across financial services, the pace of change is only accelerating. Our clients understand that next-generation technology is a key driving force for change and efficiency and there is a need among our client base to leverage this technology to address their critical business challenges. However, they face obstacles in creating the right investment and, more importantly, in applying the right talent and intellectual capital, which may be focused on their most differentiating functions. This continues to create opportunities for Broadridge to assist in the areas where we have scale and domain expertise, which includes artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud, digital, and other new technologies. 
High engagement and client-centric culture.
Broadridge is client-centric and has created and grown multi-entity infrastructures across a variety of functions with high client satisfaction. We conduct a client satisfaction survey for each of our major business units annually, the results of which are a component of all our associates’ compensation because of the importance of client retention to the achievement of our revenue goals.
We have also built a culture where we focus on having engaged and knowledgeable associates to serve clients well, which in turn creates a real and sustainable advantage. Supporting this excellent client delivery takes engaged associates, and we are passionate about creating an environment in which every associate can thrive and build their knowledge and skills. All of this creates a culture that benefits our associates, our clients, and our stockholders.
The Broadridge Business
Investor Communication Solutions
The Investor Communication Solutions segment’s revenues represented approximately 77% of our total Revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, which gives effect to the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. See “Analysis of Reportable Segments — Revenues” under “Item 701. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We provide the following services and solutions through our Investor Communication Solutions segment:
Regulatory Solutions 
We handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our bank, broker-dealer and fund clients. We offer traditional hard copy and electronic services for the delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents; maintenance of a rules engine and database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers; posting of documents on their websites; e-mail notification to investors notifying them that proxy materials are available; and proxy voting via web or mobile app. We also have the ability to combine stockholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address which we accomplish by having ascertained the delivery preferences of investors. We also offer proxy vote solicitation services for the registered clients of fund companies, efficiently managing the entire proxy campaign. In addition, we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of international proxies with the ability to process proxy voting in over 100 international markets.
A majority of publicly-traded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners. Instead, a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name,” meaning that they are held of record by broker-dealers or banks through their depositories. Most street name shares are registered in the name “Cede & Co.,” the name used by The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”), which holds shares on behalf of its participant broker-dealers and banks. These participant broker-dealers and banks (which are known as “Nominees” because they hold securities in name only) in turn hold the shares on behalf of their customers, the individual beneficial owners. Nominees, upon request, are required to provide companies with the information of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names, addresses, and shareholdings supplied to companies, so called “non-objecting beneficial owners” (or “NOBOs”). Objecting beneficial owners (or “OBOs”) may be contacted directly only by the broker-dealer or bank. As DTCC’s role is only as the custodian, a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner (such as the right to vote) to the beneficial owners. The first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy,” which DTCC executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant Nominees. Under applicable rules, Nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions.
Given the large number of Nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders, we play a unique, central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue for both Nominees, companies and investors. A large number of Nominees have contracted out the processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us. Nominees accomplish this by entering into agreements with Broadridge and transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy, which authority the Nominee receives from the DTCC via an omnibus proxy. Through our agreements with Nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services, we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of Nominees receive proxy materials on a timely basis digitally or in print, that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies and funds conducting solicitations and that these services are fulfilled in accordance with the requirements of their particular solicitation. In order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively, we interface and coordinate directly with each company and/or fund to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and timely manner. With respect to companies and funds, as it would increase the costs for companies and funds to work with all of the Nominees through which their shares are held beneficially, companies and funds work with us for the performance of all the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed on a timely basis to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported.
The SEC’s rules require public companies to reimburse Nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name. The reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), including the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). We bill public companies for the proxy services performed, collect the fees and remit to the Nominee its portion of the fees. In addition, the NYSE rules establish fees for certain services provided by intermediaries such as Broadridge in the proxy process. The preparation and delivery of NOBO information is subject to reimbursement by the corporate issuers requesting the information. The reimbursement rates are based on the number of NOBOs produced pursuant to NYSE or other SRO rules. The rules also determine the fees to be paid to third-party intermediaries, such as Broadridge, who compile the NOBO information on behalf of Nominees who need to respond to corporate issuer requests for NOBO information.
We provide institutional investors with a suite of services to manage and track the entire proxy voting process, including meeting their reporting needs. ProxyEdge is our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and presents them under a single proxy. Voting can be instructed for the entire position, by account vote group or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research providers. ProxyEdge also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting. ProxyEdge can be utilized for meetings of U.S. and Canadian companies and for meetings in many non-North American countries based on the holdings of our global custodian clients. ProxyEdge is offered in several languages and there are currently over 7,000 ProxyEdge users worldwide.
In addition to our proxy services, we provide regulatory communications services, including prospectus delivery services. Our proprietary extraction, normalization and presentment capabilities from the SEC’s EDGAR database have enabled us to provide our clients with an on-demand solution for prospectus post-sale fulfillment. This process provides efficiency for our clients as it reduces their reliance on offset print and fund delivered inventory. We provide portfolio-specific solutions for the retirement and annuity markets. We have integrated this functionality into additional capabilities to offer an efficient fulfillment model for regulatory and compliance distributions.
We also offer a complete reorganization communications solution to notify investors of reorganizations or corporate action events such as tender offers, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and class action lawsuits. Class actions and collective redress proceedings continue to grow in volume and complexity and global recovery options vary by country, resulting in a complex patchwork of participation and filing requirements. We provide global class action services handling the identification, filing and recovery of class actions and collective redress proceedings involving securities and other financial products.
We also offer our Mailbox products - Advisor Mailbox™ and Investor Mailbox® - which support and complement any investor communication strategy. Our Investor Mailbox solution provides the electronic delivery of investor communications to our clients’ websites or mobile apps, enabling investor access to regulatory delivery notices, day-to-day account and investment information and convenient response tools. Our Advisor Mailbox is an electronic communications platform for financial advisors that delivers immediate electronic access to the communications and documents sent to such advisors’ customers. Advisor Mailbox streamlines multiple communication paths for all investor-related documents into a single-visit portal that is integrated onto an advisor’s platform.
In addition, we provide international corporate governance solutions addressing clients’ needs within Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) region. Our offerings help clients address evolving requirements for stronger governance, greater transparency and improved insights derived from data analytics. These solutions are a direct extension of our U.S. and Canadian businesses and in many cases serve the same client base. Our international solutions help clients sharpen focus on their core businesses while helping them maintain regulatory compliance, reduce costs, improve efficiency and gain data insights.
As part of our international corporate governance solutions, our Global Proxy solution includes services similar to those provided by our U.S. and Canadian proxy businesses. In 2021, with the effectiveness of the European Union Shareholder Rights Directive II (“SRD II”), we have implemented an SRD II component to our Global Proxy solution. SRD II requires banks and broker-dealers that invest in European securities to provide all investors, retail and institutional, the ability to vote, disclose shareholder information upon request and distribute meeting or corporate action notices to all customers. Our SRD II solution helps our clients meet their SRD II compliance obligations and provides a seamless proxy voting platform for our clients’ retail and institutional customers.
 Data-Driven Fund Solutions
We provide a full range of data-driven solutions that help our asset management and retirement service provider clients grow revenue, operate efficiently, and maintain compliance. Our communications solutions enable global asset managers to communicate with large audiences of investors efficiently and reliably by centralizing all investor communications through one resource. We provide composition, printing, filing, and distribution services for regulatory reports, prospectuses and proxy materials, as well as proxy solicitation services. We manage the entire communications process with both registered and beneficial stockholders. Our marketing and transactional communications solutions provide a content management and omni-channel distribution platform for marketing and sales communications for asset managers and retirement service providers. In addition, our data and analytics solutions provide investment product distribution data, analytical tools, and insights and research to enable asset managers to optimize product distribution across retail and institutional channels globally.
We also provide mutual fund and exchange-traded funds trade processing services for retirement service providers, third-party administrators, financial advisors, banks and wealth management professionals through Matrix. Matrix’s operational, trust, custody, trading and mutual fund and exchange-traded funds settlement services are integrated into our product suite thereby strengthening Broadridge’s role as a provider of insight, technology and business process outsourcing to the asset management and retirement industry.
Our fiscal year 2020 acquisition of FundsLibrary has added the capabilities to provide fund document and data dissemination in the European market. FundsLibrary links fund managers to distributors and investors to provide complete, accurate and timely information supporting fund sales. The solution helps fund managers increase distribution opportunities, comply with both United Kingdom domestic and European Union regulations such as Solvency II and MiFID II, and makes information easily accessible for investors in a digital format. FundsLibrary has been combined with the FundAssist business we acquired in 2018 to form Fund Communication Solutions. The combined solution provides funds with a single, integrated provider to manage data, perform calculations, compose documents, manage regulatory compliance and disseminate information across multiple jurisdictions.

We provide governance and communications services to corporate issuers.

Global Technology and Operations
Transactions involving securities and other financial market instruments originate with an investor, who places an order with a broker who in turn routes that order to an appropriate market for execution. At that point, the parties to the transaction coordinate payment and settlement of the transaction through a clearinghouse. The records of the parties involved must then be updated to reflect completion of the transaction. Tax, custody, accounting and record-keeping requirements must be complied with in connection with the transaction and the customer’s account information must correctly reflect the transaction. The accurate processing of trading activity from its initial inception and custody activity requires effective automation and information flow across multiple systems and functions within the firm and across the systems of the various parties that participate in the execution of a transaction. 
Our Global Technology and Operations segment provides solutions that automate the front-to-back transaction lifecycle of equity, mutual fund, fixed income, foreign exchange and exchange-traded derivatives, from order capture and execution through trade confirmation, margin, cash management, clearing and settlement, reference data management, reconciliations, securities financing and collateral management, asset servicing, compliance and regulatory reporting, portfolio accounting and custody-related services. Our solutions provide automated straight through processing operations and enable buy- and sell-side financial institutions to efficiently and cost-effectively consolidate their books and records, gather and service assets under management, focus on their core businesses, and manage risk. With our multi-market, multi-asset class, multi-entity and multi-currency capabilities, we provide trade processing on a global basis. In addition, we provide business process outsourcing services for our buy- and sell-side clients’ businesses. These services combine our technology with our operations expertise to support the entire trade lifecycle, including securities clearing and settlement, reconciliations, record-keeping, wealth management asset servicing, and custody-related functions.
The Global Technology and Operations segment’s revenues represented approximately 25% and 26% of our total Revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, which gives effect to the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. See “Analysis of Reportable Segments — Revenues” under “Item 701. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Services and solutions offered through the Global Technology and Operations segment include the following:

Clients
We serve a large and diverse client base including banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, retirement service providers, corporate issuers and wealth and asset management firms. Our clients in the financial services industry include retail and institutional brokerage firms, global banks, mutual funds, asset managers, insurance companies, annuity companies, institutional investors, specialty trading firms, clearing firms, third-party administrators, hedge funds, and financial advisors. Our corporate issuer clients are typically publicly held companies. In addition to financial services firms, we service corporate clients in the healthcare, insurance, consumer finance, telecommunications, utilities, and other service industries with their essential communications.

•processed on average over $9 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day of U.S. and Canadian securities; and
•provided fixed income trade processing services to 20 of the 24 primary dealers of fixed income securities in the U.S.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our Investor Communication Solutions business competes with companies that provide investor communication and corporate governance solutions including proxy services providers, transfer agents, proxy advisory firms, proxy solicitation firms and financial printers. We also face competition from numerous firms in the compiling, printing and electronic distribution of statements, bills and other customer communications. Within our Global Technology and Operations business, our capital markets solutions compete with in-house operations and vendors that provide trade processing, back-office record keeping, and sell-side order and execution management systems. Similarly, our wealth management solutions compete with service providers that deliver data, technology solutions, and marketing services, and our investment management solutions compete with firms that provide portfolio management, compliance and operational support solutions.
Technology
We have several information processing systems that serve as the core foundation of our technology platform. We leverage these systems in order to provide our services. We are committed to maintaining extremely high levels of quality service through our skilled technical employees and the use of our technology within an environment that seeks continual improvement. Our mission-critical applications are designed to provide high levels of availability, scalability, reliability, and flexibility. They operate on industry standard enterprise architecture platforms that provide high degrees of horizontal and vertical scaling. This scalability and redundancy allows us to provide high degrees of system availability. As part of Broadridge’s technology strategy, we leverage traditional data center services as well as private cloud and public cloud services. In 2010, we entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “IT Services Agreement”) with International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), which was amended and restated in 2019 (the “Amended IT Services Agreement”). Under the Amended IT Services Agreement, IBM performs a broad range of technology services, including supporting our mainframe, midrange, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services.
In 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited (“IBM UK”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “EU IT Services Agreement”), which was amended in 2019 (the “Amended EU IT Services Agreement”). Under the Amended EU IT Services Agreement, IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company’s technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia.
In 2019, we entered into an information technology agreement with IBM for private cloud services (the “IBM Private Cloud Agreement”) under which IBM will operate, manage and support the Company’s private cloud global distributed platforms and products, and operate and manage certain Company networks.
Most of our systems and applications operate in highly resilient data centers that employ multiple active power and cooling distribution paths, redundant components, and are capable of providing 99.995% availability. Additionally, the data centers provide infrastructure capacity and capability to permit any planned activity without disruption to the critical load, and can sustain at least one worst-case, unplanned failure or event with no critical load impact. Our geographically dispersed processing centers also provide disaster recovery and business continuity processing.
Product Development. Our products and services are designed with reliability, availability, scalability, and flexibility so that we can fully meet our clients’ processing needs. These applications are built in a manner that allows us to meet the breadth and depth of requirements of our financial services industry clients in a highly efficient manner. We continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing products and services, taking into account input from clients, industry-wide initiatives and regulatory changes affecting our clients.
Intellectual Property. We own a portfolio of more than 110 U.S. and non-U.S. patent and patent applications. We also own registered marks for our trade name and own or have applied for trademark registrations for many of our services and products. We regard our products and services as proprietary and utilize internal security practices and confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees, clients, and others for protection. We believe that we are the owner or in some cases, the licensee, of all intellectual property and other proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business. 
Cybersecurity
Our information security program is designed to meet the needs of our clients who entrust us with their sensitive information. Our program includes encryption, data masking technology, data loss prevention technology, authentication technology, entitlement management, access control, anti-malware software, and transmission of data over private networks, among other systems and procedures designed to protect against unauthorized access to information, including by cyber-attacks. In addition, we conduct regular security awareness training as well as testing for our employees.
To further demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the highest levels of quality service, information security, and client satisfaction within an environment that fosters continual improvement, most of our business units and our core applications and facilities for the provision of many services including our proxy services, U.S. equity and fixed income securities processing services, and IBM’s data centers, are International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 27001 certified. This security standard specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System within the context of the organization’s overall business risks. It specifies the requirements for the implementation of security controls customized to the needs of individual organizations. The ISO 27001 standard addresses confidentiality, access control, vulnerability, business continuity, and risk assessment.
Additionally, Broadridge is utilizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the “NIST Framework”) issued by the U.S. government in 2014 and updated in 2018, as a guideline to manage our cybersecurity-related risk. The NIST Framework outlines 108 subcategories of security controls and outcomes over five functions: identify, protect, detect, respond and recover.
Regulation
The securities and financial services industries are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the U.S. and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets. Due to the nature of our services and the markets we serve, these regulatory bodies impact our businesses in the following various manners.
In the U.S., the securities and financial services industries are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws. At the federal level, the SEC regulates the securities industry, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), the various stock exchanges, and other SROs. The Department of Labor (“DOL”) enforces the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) regulations on fiduciaries and organizations that provide services to retirement plans such as Matrix. As a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities, our services, such as our proxy and shareholder report processing and distribution services, are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject. As a result, the services we provide may be required to change as applicable laws and regulations are adopted or revised. We monitor legislative and rulemaking activity by the SEC, FINRA, DOL, the stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies that may impact our services, and if new laws or regulations are adopted or changes are made to existing laws or regulations applicable to our services, we expect to adapt our business practices and service offerings to continue to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under new or modified requirements.
Certain aspects of our business are subject to regulatory compliance or oversight. As a provider of technology services to financial institutions, certain aspects of our U.S. operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration. Periodic examinations by the FFIEC generally include areas such as internal audit, risk management, business continuity planning, information security, systems development, and third-party vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect our banking and financial services clients.
In addition, our business process outsourcing, mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions, as well as the entities providing those services, are subject to regulatory oversight. Our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by a broker-dealer, Broadridge Business Process Outsourcing, LLC (“BBPO”). BBPO is registered with the SEC, is a member of FINRA and is required to participate in the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). Although BBPO’s FINRA membership agreement allows it to engage in clearing, and the retailing of corporate securities in addition to mutual fund retailing on a wire order basis, BBPO does not clear customer transactions, process any retail business or carry customer accounts. BBPO is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business, including trade practices, capital requirements, record retention, money laundering prevention, the protection of customer funds and customer securities, and the supervision of the conduct of directors, officers and employees. A failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or revocation of SEC or FINRA authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of its directors, officers or employees. 
There has been continual regulatory scrutiny of the securities industry including the outsourcing by firms of their operations or functions. This oversight could result in the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules with respect to business process outsourcing. As a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, BBPO is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which requires BBPO to maintain a minimum net capital amount. At June 30, 2021, BBPO was in compliance with this capital requirement.
BBPO, as a “Managing Clearing Member” of the Options Clearing Corporation (the “OCC”), is also subject to OCC Rule 309(b) with respect to the business process outsourcing services that it provides to other OCC “Managed Clearing Member” broker-dealers. OCC Rule 309(b) requires that BBPO maintain a minimum net capital amount. At June 30, 2021, BBPO was in compliance with this capital requirement.
Matrix Trust Company (“Matrix Trust”), is a Colorado State non-depository trust company and National Securities Clearing Corporation trust member, whose primary business is to provide cash agent, custodial and directed trustee services to institutional customers, and investment management services to collective investment trust funds (“CITs”). As a result, Matrix Trust is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Colorado Division of Banking and the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions, as well as the National Securities Clearing Corporation. Specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items, when applicable, must be met. At June 30, 2021, Matrix Trust was in compliance with its capital requirements. In addition, in connection with the offering of CITs, Matrix Trust acts as a discretionary trustee and an ERISA fiduciary. CITs are subject to regulation by the IRS, federal and state banking regulators, and ERISA, which impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA. Matrix Trust is also subject to regulation by the Colorado Division of Banking and the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions which regulate the CITs pursuant to Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulation.
Our transfer agency business, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, is subject to certain SEC rules and regulations, including annual reporting, examination, internal controls, proper safeguarding of issuer and shareholder funds and securities, and obligations relating to its operations. Our transfer agency business has been formally approved by the NYSE to act as a transfer agent or registrar for issuers of NYSE listed securities and as a result, it is subject to certain NYSE requirements concerning operational standards. Furthermore, it is also subject to U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regulations, as well as certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Federal Trade Commission’s (the “FTC”) regulations with respect to maintenance of information security safeguards. In addition, certain state laws govern certain services performed by our transfer agency business.
In addition, our regulated businesses are required to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, such as, in the U.S., the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (collectively, the “BSA”), and the BSA implementing regulations of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. A variety of similar anti-money laundering requirements apply in other countries.
Privacy and Information Security Regulations 
The processing and transfer of personal information is required to provide certain of our services. Data privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries apply to the access, collection, transfer, use, storage, and destruction of personal information. In the U.S., our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the GLBA, in addition to other regulations. As a processor of personal information in our role as a provider of services to financial institutions, we must comply with the FTC’s Safeguards Rule implementing certain provisions of GLBA with respect to maintenance of information security safeguards.
We perform services for healthcare companies and are, therefore, subject to compliance with laws and regulations regarding healthcare information, including in the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). We also perform credit-related services and agree to comply with payment card standards, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. In addition, federal and state privacy and information security laws, and consumer protection laws, which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information, also apply to our businesses.
Privacy laws and regulations may require notification to affected individuals, federal and state regulators, and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, certain personal information. Privacy laws outside the U.S. may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than U.S. laws and regulations, and may impose additional duties on us in the performance of our services.
There has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer, accompanied by legislation, regulations and enforcement activity intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. 
The law in this area continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the U.S., the European Union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. For example, the European Union Parliament adopted the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became effective as of January 2020 and the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) will become effective on January 1, 2023. In addition, several U.S. states have also recently adopted new privacy laws or are proposing to pass their own state privacy laws.
We continually monitor privacy and information security laws and regulations and while we believe that we are compliant with our regulatory responsibilities, information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure. In addition, legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings, or other events could expose Broadridge to increased costs, liability, and possible damage to our reputation.
Legal Compliance 
Regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury place prohibitions and restrictions on all U.S. citizens and entities, including the Company, with respect to transactions by U.S. persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on OFAC's sanctions lists and Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (for example, individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions, as well as terrorists, terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by OFAC under programs that are not country specific). Similar requirements apply to transactions and dealings with persons and entities specified in lists maintained in other countries. We have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries, individuals or entities.
Compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our businesses with an international reach can be complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. Our international business could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, trade restrictions and embargoes, data privacy requirements, labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting bribery and other improper payments or inducements, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, vendors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations, particularly as we expand our operations, including through acquisitions of businesses that were not previously subject to and may not have familiarity with laws and regulations applicable to us or compliance policies similar to ours. Any violations of sanctions or export control regulations or other laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including the imposition of substantial fines and interest or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also damage our reputation, our international expansion efforts and our business, and negatively impact our operating results.
Seasonality
Processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies. This has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters.  The seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.
Human Capital Management 
As of June 30, 2021, we had 13,704 full-time associates, of which approximately 56% were employed in the Americas, 12% in Europe, and 32% in the APAC region, where a substantial number of associates are in India. None of our associates are subject to collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our employee relations are good. 
We are driven by the success of each of our associates, and we recognize that it is because of their hard work, talent and commitment that we continue to deliver outstanding results for our clients. That is why we strive to provide a workplace that fosters a collaborative and supportive culture where everyone feels welcomed, accepted and empowered to be their best.
At the center of our associate engagement efforts is the concept of the Service-Profit Chain, where engaged associates deliver world-class service, which creates satisfied clients and, in turn, produces strong, long-term value for stockholders.
Our Board of Directors believes that human capital management and succession planning are vital to our success. The Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has oversight over human capital management matters, including initiatives and programs that concern our culture, talent, recruitment, retention and associate engagement. In addition, our Chief Human Resources Officer and our Chief Diversity Officer report to our Board periodically on our initiatives and progress on diversity, equity and inclusion practices. The Board annually reviews the Company’s executive talent including the Company’s leadership bench and succession planning. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We are dedicated to fostering a diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy environment. As a leading provider of technology, communications and data and analytics solutions to businesses around the world, it is critical that we understand, embrace and operate in a multicultural environment. Every associate has unique strengths, which, when fully appreciated and embraced, allows everyone to perform at their best, leading to our success. Our goal is to ensure our associates at every level of the organization better represent the diversity of the clients we serve and communities in which we work. We are committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and values into our culture.
We have an Executive Diversity Committee, chaired by our President, that meets quarterly and provides insight and recommendations on critical diversity, equity and inclusion-related opportunities and issues. In addition, we support a number of associate-led employee resource groups (our Associate Networks), where associates with similar backgrounds and interests can find peer support, shape company culture, receive mentorship and sponsorship from senior members and develop their careers. 
In 2020, we appointed a Chief Diversity Officer, whose role is to design and implement a holistic diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, and partner with our business units to develop the resources and competencies needed to drive this strategy. Our Chief Diversity Officer is a member of the Executive Diversity Committee and provides regular updates to our Chief Executive Officer and executive leadership team. In addition, the Chief Diversity Officer serves as an advisor on global initiatives, such as our Associate Networks, and our recruitment and compliance efforts. 
Talent and Development
We believe that our associates are among our most important assets. Encouraging professional development opportunities is a core part of our culture. One important resource we provide our associates is Broadridge University, a comprehensive suite of online courses and on-site training. We also have a tuition reimbursement program, and we support participation in external learning opportunities. In 2021, we launched our reverse mentoring program, which supports associate engagement and increasing a sense of belonging and inclusion by aligning associates from all levels and backgrounds (including but not limited to different generations, race, gender, ability, and sexual orientation) to serve as mentors to senior leaders.
Health, Safety and Wellness
We are committed to providing a safe workplace. We continuously strive to meet or exceed all laws, regulations and accepted practices pertaining to workplace safety. We have developed extensive safety policies, standards and procedures to which all associates are required to comply. Our policies are based on both U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and site-specific guidelines to ensure that associates work in a safe and healthy environment. At our larger production facilities and at certain other locations, we house on-site Wellness Centers staffed with physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants who provide a wide variety of medical services at no cost to our associates. 
As we navigate the Covid-19 pandemic, the well-being of our associates is one of our highest priorities. We have taken numerous steps in support of these priorities, including remote work for our non-production associates, and stringent safety and disinfecting measures in our facilities to mitigate the spread of the virus. We removed economic pressure to work by providing extended leave for those who are ill, quarantined, or have a family member in a high-risk group. The Broadridge Pandemic/Covid-19 Committee continues to track the latest developments of the pandemic. We have deployed a task force focused on re-opening our offices to the highest safety standards, including monitoring the external environment, usage of personal protective equipment, providing financial incentives for vaccination, and other measures.
Associate Compensation and Benefits
We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages. In addition, we offer various types of compensation, which vary by associate role and country/region, and may include annual bonuses, stock awards, and retirement savings plans. In addition we offer the following benefits (which may vary by country/region): healthcare and insurance benefits, tax efficient or savings programs, such as health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, health savings account and pretax commuter benefits or green transport tax savings schemes, paid time off, paid parental leave, quarantine and Covid leave, vaccination time off, life and disability insurance, business travel accident insurance, charitable gift matching, tuition assistance and on-site health centers, among others. 
Associate Engagement
We regularly conduct multiple surveys and focus groups to assess associate engagement and determine if and how perspectives have changed over time. Our surveys and focus group practices allow our associates to share their views on our workplace, the importance of various aspects of work life, among other topics. The themes and insights of our associate feedback are shared with our executive leadership and has been instrumental in shaping our approach to planning for the future of our workplace. In 2021, our employee engagement score rose 8% from 2020, and for the third consecutive year, we received U.S. and Canada certification from Great Place to Work® for our outstanding workplace culture. We also received certification in India for the fourth consecutive year and first-time certification in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Russia. The Great Place to Work Institute is a global authority on high-trust, high-performance workplaces.
