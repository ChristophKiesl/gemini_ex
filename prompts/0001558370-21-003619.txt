Item 1. Our Business

Business Description
Precipio, Inc., and its subsidiaries, (collectively, “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or “Precipio”) is a cancer diagnostics and reagent technology company providing diagnostic products and services to the oncology market. We have built and continue to develop a platform designed to eradicate the problem of misdiagnosis by harnessing the intellect, expertise and technologies developed within academic institutions, and delivering quality diagnostic information to physicians and their patients worldwide. We operate a cancer diagnostic laboratory located in New Haven, Connecticut and have partnered with various academic institutions to capture the expertise, experience and technologies developed within academia to provide a better standard of cancer diagnostics and aim to solve the growing problem of cancer misdiagnosis. In support of this platform, we also operate a research and development facility in Omaha, Nebraska which focuses on the development of various technologies, among them our internally developed proprietary products IV-Cell and HemeScreen. To expand our product offering capabilities, the Omaha facility was recently CLIA and CAP certified in order to process a variety of commercial molecular tests previously referenced out and to further expand our capabilities and “know-how” in transitioning R&D lab generated technology into a commercial laboratory environment. 
 The Company also holds an exclusive license to patented ICE-COLD-PCR, or ICP technology from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc., or Dana-Farber, at Harvard University. PCR is described further below. We believe that such technology will provide additional services and products directed at improving diagnostic outcomes and providing physicians with options for targeted therapies. 
In April 2020, the Company formed a joint venture with Poplar Healthcare PLLC (“Poplar”), which we refer to as the “Joint Venture”. The Joint Venture was formed by the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Precipio Oncometrix LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“POC”), which was entered into as of April 11, 2020 (the “Effective Date”), by and among POC, Poplar, and Precipio SPV Inc. (“Precipio SPV”), a newly formed subsidiary of the Company. The business purpose of the Joint Venture is to facilitate and capitalize on the combined capabilities, resources and healthcare industry relationships of its members by partnering, promoting and providing oncology services to office based physicians, hospitals and medical centers
The Company’s business is to offer an integrated platform aimed at mitigating misdiagnoses. We understand the issues of commercial laboratories because we are a commercial lab. We isolate testing process problems, we target testing cost inefficiencies, we develop testing technology to increase diagnostic accuracy and we seek out solutions to address turnaround time. Combining our commercial and development expertise with academia we continually expand relationships with subspecialists in order to provide access for physicians and patients.
Industry
We believe that there is currently a significant problem with unaddressed rates of misdiagnosis across numerous disease states (particularly in blood-related cancers) due to an inefficient and commoditized industry. We believe that the diagnostic industry focuses primarily on competitive pricing and test turnaround times, at the expense of quality and accuracy. Increasingly complex disease states are met with eroding specialization rather than increased subspecialized expertise. According to a study conducted by the National Coalition of Health, this results in an industry with cancer misdiagnosis rates as high as 28%, which is failing to meet the needs of physicians, patients and the healthcare system as a whole. New technologies offer improved accuracy; however, many are either inaccessible or are not economically practical for clinical use. Despite much publicity of the industry transitioning from fee-per-service to value-based payments, this transition has not yet occurred in diagnostics. When a patient is misdiagnosed, physicians end up administering incorrect treatments, often creating adverse effects rather than improving outcomes. We believe that Insurance Providers, Medicare and Medicaid waste valuable dollars on the application of incorrect treatments and can incur substantial downstream costs. According to a report by Pinnacle Health, the estimated cost of misdiagnosis within the healthcare system is $750 billion annually. Most importantly however, patients pay the ultimate price of misdiagnosis with increased morbidity and mortality. We are of the view that the academic path of specialization produces the critical expertise necessary to correctly diagnose disease, and that academic institutions have an untapped potential to address this problem. Our solution is to create a unique platform that harnesses sub-specialist expertise and proprietary technologies to 

3



deliver the highest standard of diagnostic accuracy and patient care. Physicians, hospitals, payers and, most importantly, patients all benefit from more accurate diagnostic outcomes.
Market
Our market is the US domestic oncology market where we participate as a commercial diagnostic laboratory. The Oncology market is estimated to have annual revenues exceeding $20 billion. The Company also services and provides new technologies to the oncology reagent market in the form of the HemeScreen and IV-Cell product offerings. The reagent market is estimated to have annual revenues exceeding $14 billion.  The annual growth rate of each market segment is estimated at 5%.
The Company currently provides diagnostic blood cancer testing services in 14 states predominately east of the Mississippi River from its New Haven, Connecticut commercial lab.  Building on our commercial laboratory expertise, we have developed several impact reagent technologies that are extremely cost effective and reduce the diagnostic time and material currently needed to perform such tests. The Company anticipates gaining a share of the oncology reagent market as commercial diagnostic laboratories and oncology practices adopt its new cost effective technology.  See Recent Development – Business Activities.
Our Solution
Our Platform
Our platform is designed to provide better diagnoses for cancer. To our knowledge, we are the only company focused on addressing the issue of diagnostic accuracy. Third party studies have shown misdiagnoses to be as high as 1 in 5 patients. Our operating platform has been constructed with the mission of not only providing the highest quality pathology testing services but of developing innovative products to mitigate misdiagnoses. Further, our platform enables our commercial lab to be utilized as an incubator for the development of new technologies aimed at addressing misdiagnosis.
Today, the platform is robust and scalable:

● | Providing physicians and their patients access to world-class academic experts and technologies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Allowing payers to benefit from quality-based outcomes to their patients and increase the likelihood of cost savings;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enabling cross-collaboration between physicians and academic institutions to advance research and discovery; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing new technologies to laboratories worldwide that lower costs and reduce lengthy testing processes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our Technology 


1. | IV-CellTM
---+----------


IV-Cell is a proprietary cell culture media that addresses the problem of selective and serial culturing. IV-Cell is a universal media that enables simultaneous culturing of all 4 hematopoietic cell lineages. This is a significant breakthrough in processing work required by laboratories worldwide. Internally developed by Precipio, the culturing technology ensures that no cell lineage is missed in the diagnostic process. IV-Cell allows the laboratory technician to select any of the 4 lineages during the culturing process.
​
Hematopoietic Diseases: The diagnostic process of hematopoietic diseases involves chromosomal analysis by conducting cell-culture based tests by a cytogenetics laboratory to imitate in-vivo conditions. The four groups of cell lineages cultured are:
​

● | Myeloid cells – indicating myeloid neoplasms (MDS, AML, CML);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

4




● | B-cells – indicating B-cell neoplasms (B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | T-cells – indicating T-cell neoplasms (T-cell lymphoma); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Plasma cells – indicating plasma cell neoplasms (multiple myeloma)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ​
IV-Cell, our proprietary media, enables the lab technician to begin culturing all 4 cell lineages simultaneously, effectively mimicking human biology. IV-Cell media ensures that ultimately the correct cell lineage is cultured, avoiding the risk of misalignment caused by current market media, which may result in a compromised diagnosis. Precipio’s advanced IV-Cell technology replaces the current time consuming lengthy process whereby the cytogeneticist must decide up front which cell lineage to select to be cultured. In most cases, due to specimen limitation, low cellularity, or cell viability, the cytogeneticist can select only one of the above cell lines to culture. Often, the initial clinical suspicion is not in line with the final diagnosis determined by the pathologist based on the rest of the work up. Our internal data from testing within the Company’s commercial lab has shown that this occurs in approximately 40% of bone marrow biopsies. If the wrong cell lineage is selected, the diagnosis may be compromised (or return a false negative diagnosis) because the lab will be culturing and investigating the wrong cells. 
​
Product confirmation: IV-Cell was validated in our laboratory in parallel with existing commercially available reagents and has successfully demonstrated superior results. Subsequently, IV-Cell has been used at our laboratory for the past 3 years on >1,000 clinical specimens, producing superior diagnostic results. IV-Cell also produces chromosomes with an average band resolution of 500, approximately 25% higher than achieved with standard culture media.
 ​
We are commercializing this technology by providing major laboratories with access to the media. The IV-Cell technology and media can be purchased via a direct supply contract, whereby Precipio will contract with a manufacturer (under license and non-disclosure) to produce the media.
​

2. | HemeScreenTM
---+-------------

 ​
HemeScreen technology that was initially developed by the Company targeting Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (“MPN”) has evolved into a “suite” of robust genetic diagnostic panels. Today, the Company is marketing MPN blood cancer panel and projects the release of additional diagnostic panels during 2021. Regarding the current MPN HemeScreen panel it is estimated that annually 140,000 patients are diagnosed with the blood cancer diseases. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (the “NCCN”) guidelines require that these patients be tested for genetic mutations in five key genes:
​

● | JAK2 (exon 12);
--+----------------


● | JAK2 (exon 13)
--+---------------

JAK2 14 (including V617F);

● | CALR; and
--+----------


● | MPL
--+----

 ​
Precipio has registered provisional patents on its proprietary screening panel for all of the above genes. The Company’s revolutionary technology enables screening to be completed in one rapid scanning process. The HemeScreen test screens for the presence of these mutations in an extremely efficient and very economical manner. In developing HemeScreen, Precipio focused on improving the economics of providing blood cancer diagnostic tests and reducing laboratory technician time consumed in the testing process. By using Precipio’s HemeScreen media laboratories can:
​

1. | Reduce the batch requirements for the test;
---+--------------------------------------------


2. | Significantly reduce the turnaround time for results;
---+------------------------------------------------------


3. | Provide improved clinical service to physicians; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------


4. | Yield significant costs savings.
---+---------------------------------

​
In addressing the diagnostic results it is very important to understand that the clinical significance of these mutations is substantial to patient treatment. Case in point, a mutation in the JAK2 gene indicates the patient may be eligible for a targeted therapy. A positive result in the CALR or MPL gene indicates a good prognosis, meaning the disease 

5



is less aggressive, and the physician may therefore choose to treat the patient in a less aggressive manner. The results of these genetic tests are critical to determining a treatment plan, and therefore the importance, and the speed of which the results are delivered, may significantly impact patient care. HemeScreen represents exactly what Precipio’s technology and focus is all about, targeting misdiagnoses.
 ​
Today, for this type of cancer testing we believe physician ordering patterns for the test are encumbered by the economics (reimbursement less costs to test) and length of time (2 to 4 weeks) for results to be reported. As a result of the costs and length of test reporting time, we believe, patients needing this exact type of testing, to assist in determining therapeutic options, may not be afforded the opportunity. We believe the HemeScreen technology addresses both issues by providing substantial reductions in both time and cost to test for these genetic mutations. 
​
At the current reimbursement levels (approximately $600 for the full panel at Medicare rates) and given the costs of labor and of the existing reagents to process the tests, laboratories running the test in house must either batch samples to gain efficiency, or send the test out to another reference laboratory. Most hospital laboratories don’t have the volume and patient frequency to economically justify running the test, and therefore they send the test out. This has created an industry average turnaround time for results of between 2-4 weeks (depending on the lab providing the test).
 ​
As a certified CLIA laboratory, Precipio offers HemeScreen testing and 48 hour turnaround. As a product company, Precipio has introduced the HemeScreen Reagent Rental (“HSSR”) program to high-end commercial labs, regional hospital groups, large oncology practices and smaller office based oncology practices. The HSSR program is a turn-key solution offering appropriately sized diagnostic equipment, training on the equipment and new technology, and a research use only (“RUO”) reagent purchase program size to the account. 
​
At an average reimbursement rate of approximately $600 per test, the current US Market Revenue Potential is approximately $80 million per year, in addition to international demand. We believe HemeScreen is a game changer technology for these tests and we believe HemeScreen has the capability of impacting physician use of the test. 
​
The HemeScreen technology is projected to evolve into a suite of screening products addressing numerous others genes. If successful, we therefore believe our technology may materially increase the HemeScreen market.
​

3. | ICE-COLD-PCR
---+-------------


ICP technology was developed at Harvard and is licensed exclusively to us by Dana-Farber. ICP is a unique, proprietary, patented specimen enrichment technology that increases the sensitivity of molecular based tests from approximately 90-95% to 99.99%. Traditional molecular testing is done on tumor biopsies. These tests are typically conducted at disease onset, when the patient undergoes a biopsy. In the typical course of treatment, a patient is rarely re-biopsied, and therefore, genetic information is based solely on the initial biopsy. Tumors are known to shed cells into the patient’s bloodstream where they circulate alongside normal cells; however, existing testing methodologies are not sufficiently sensitive to differentiate between tumor and normal cells. The increased sensitivity provided by ICP allows for testing of genetic mutations that occur within tumors to be conducted on peripheral blood samples, termed liquid biopsies. This technical capability enables physicians to test for genetic mutations through a simple blood test rather than an invasive biopsy extracted from the actual tumor. The results of such tests can be used for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic decisions. The technology is encapsulated within a chemical (reagent) used during the specimen preparation process, which enriches (amplifies) the tumor DNA detected within the blood sample while suppressing the normal DNA. In addition to offering this technology as a clinical service, we are developing panels that will be sold as reagent kits to other laboratories to enable this testing in their facilities, thereby improving their test sensitivity and more accurate diagnoses via liquid biopsies. The business model of selling reagents to other laboratories expands the reach and impact of our technology while eliminating the reimbursement risks from running the tests in-house.
​
Gene sequencing is performed on tissue biopsies taken surgically from the tumor site in order to identify potential therapies that will be more effective in treating the patient. There are several limitations to this process. First, surgical procedures have several limitations, including:
​

● | Cost: surgical procedures are usually performed in a costly hospital environment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6




● | Surgical access: various tumor sites are not always accessible (e.g. brain tumors), in which cases no biopsy is available for diagnosis;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Risk: patient health may not permit undergoing an invasive surgery; therefore, a biopsy cannot be obtained at all; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Time: the process of scheduling and coordinating a surgical procedure often takes time, delaying the start of patient treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Second, there are several tumor-related limitations that provide a challenge to obtaining such genetic information from a tumor:
​

● | Tumors are heterogeneous by nature: a tissue sample from one area of the tumor may not properly represent the tumor’s entire genetic composition; thus, the diagnostic results from a tumor may be incomplete and non-representative.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Metastases: in order to accurately test a patient with metastatic disease, ideally an individual biopsy sample should be taken from each site (if those sites are even known). These biopsies are very difficult to obtain; therefore, physicians often rely on biopsies taken only from the primary tumor site.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We license the ICP technology from Dana-Farber through a license agreement referred to herein as the License Agreement. The License Agreement grants us an exclusive license to the ICP technology, subject to a non-exclusive license granted to the U.S. government, in the areas of mutation detection using Sanger (di-deoxy) sequencing and mitochondrial DNA analysis for all research, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic uses in humans, animals, viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants or fossilized material. The License Agreement also grants us a non-exclusive license in the areas of mutation detection using DHPLC, surveyor-endonuclease-based mutation detection and next generation sequencing techniques. We paid Dana-Farber an initial license fee and are required to make milestone payments with respect to the first five licensed products or services we develop using the licensed technology, as well as royalties ranging from high single to low double digits on net sales of licensed products and services for sales made by us and sales made to any distributors. The License Agreement remains in effect until we cease to sell licensed products or services under said agreement. Dana-Farber has the right to immediately terminate the License Agreement if (i) we cease to carry on our business with respect to licensed products and services, (ii) we fail to make any payments under the License Agreement (subject to a cure period), (iii) we fail to comply with due diligence obligations under the License Agreement (subject to a cure period), (iv) we default in our obligations to procure and maintain insurance as required by the License Agreement, (v) any of our officers is convicted of a felony relating to the manufacture, use, sale or importation of licensed products under the License Agreement, (vi) we materially breach any provision of the License Agreement (subject to a cure period), or (vii) we or Dana-Farber become insolvent. We may terminate the License Agreement for convenience upon 180 days’ prior written notice.

Our Products & Services
Our offerings consist of clinical diagnostic services harnessing the expertise of pathologists from premier academic institutions and the commercialization and application of our various technologies. Our clinical diagnostic services focus on the diagnosis of different hematopoietic or blood-related cancers and the delivery of an accurate diagnosis to oncologists, with demonstrated superior results through the harnessing of subspecialized academic pathologists. Our proprietary cytogenetics media IV-Cell enables laboratories to arrive at more accurate results while reducing inventory and other operating costs. Our proprietary HemeScreen panels enable hospitals and laboratories (whether reference labs or physician-office labs, called POLs) to run an important genetic mutation test at an economically lower cost, resulting in faster results delivered to physicians and their patients. Our liquid biopsy technology, ICP, enables detection of abnormalities in blood samples down to as low as .01%. Our COVID testing distribution agreements enable the Company to provide to Point-of-Care providers an easy to use, highly accurate (<99%) 10 minute FDA approved COVID anti-body test. Our customers are oncologists, hospitals, reference laboratories, POLs, pharma and biotech companies. The Company believes that its technologies enable customers to achieve more accurate results for their patients, with improved economics, as well as providing results that could lead to improvements in clinical outcomes. 

We provide our CLIA and CAP certified laboratory services and products in our New Haven CT and Omaha NE facilities. Laboratory operations include sub-departments such as flow cytometry, immuno-histochemistry, cytogenetics, 

7



and molecular testing. Our laboratory operations are directed by our Chief Medical Officer, a board certified pathologist. As mandated by State and Federal regulations our laboratory is inspected every two years by a Connecticut state-appointed inspector and/or CAP. Furthermore, the laboratory supervisors and medical director must conduct a self-inspection every two years (rotating with the state inspection) and must submit those results to the state department of health. Our facility in Omaha was also recently certified as a CLIA and CAP facility.
​
Our Strategy 
Our vision is to mitigate the problem of cancer misdiagnosis, caused by two industry-wide problems. The first problem is the lack of access to subspecialist expertise; the second is addressing diagnostic costs and time to test.  In order to accomplish our vision we have established two folds to our business. The first is the pathology/diagnostic business which is aimed at addressing the first problem of subspecialist expertise. Our platform enables subspecialist expertise to be aggregated. Utilizing academic expert pathologists across multiple academic institutions enables the Company to provide access for the community based oncologist to subspecialists. The second aspect of our business is the development of products/technologies that improve commercial laboratory testing quality, lower costs and significantly reduce the diagnostic time to test. 
​
In support of our strategy, the Company’s commercial laboratory serves two functions. First, it serves our oncology customers by analyzing the patient biopsies received using the technologies we’ve developed. The goal is to provide them with a diagnosis rendered by an expert and as required an academic subspecialist. The second function of our commercial lab is to serve as an incubator for our R&D center to design, develop and test new technologies. The Company recognizes the importance of development but prides itself on truly understanding how to transition technology from the R&D lab to a commercial lab setting. The importance of being able to prove the efficacy of new technology in a commercial lab environment over long periods of time and a large four-digit sample size is invaluable.
Competition
Our principal competition in clinical pathology services comes largely from two groups. The first group consists of companies that specialize in oncology and offer directly competing services to our diagnostic services. These companies provide a high level of service focused on oncology and offer their services to oncologists and pathology departments within hospitals. Competitors in this group include Neogenomics, GenPath Diagnostics and Inform Diagnostics. The second group consists of large commercial companies that offer a wide variety of laboratory tests ranging from simple chemistry tests to complex genetic testing. Competitors in this group include LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. Within the liquid biopsy market, our competitors include Foundation Medicine, Guardant Health and Trovagene, Inc.
Competitive Advantage
In addition to our internally generated products, the Company capitalizes on the intellectual expertise and technologies developed by experts within academic institutions. While several industry papers report a case misdiagnosis rate as high as 28%, we believe that leveraging our assets with academic expertise can significantly reduce this rate. In an initial data set of over 100 clinical cases received and processed by us and with a diagnosis rendered by academic pathologists, we believe less than 1% have resulted in misdiagnosis. The diagnostic report provided by us was then requested by a patient or the patient’s physician for a second opinion to be conducted by another laboratory. In these instances, less than 1% were in disagreement with our report’s original diagnosis. Though less than 5% of all cancer patients are treated in academic centers that benefit from this specialized expertise, the majority of patients are diagnosed by commercial reference laboratories. These commercial laboratories and diagnostic companies have broad access to and serve over 95% of all cancer patients; however, their lack of specialized expertise results in significantly higher misdiagnosis rates. Academic institutions also invest heavily in the development of new technologies, most of which is used internally and does not benefit outside or commercial lab patients. Our platform provides all patients with access to these innovative technologies developed by us and in collaboration with other academic institutions we engage with.

Government Regulation
The healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental entities at the federal, state and local level. Laws and regulations in the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation. Our business is impacted not only by those laws and regulations that are directly applicable to us but also by certain laws and regulations that are applicable to our payers, vendors and referral sources. While our management believes we are in compliance with all of the existing laws and regulations applicable to us, such laws and regulations are subject to rapid change and often are uncertain in their application and enforcement. Further, to the extent we engage in new business initiatives, we must continue to evaluate whether new laws and regulations are applicable to us. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under one or more of these laws or that any enforcement actions would not be successful. Any such challenge, whether or not successful, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and consolidated financial statements.
​
Our current active laboratory certifications can be found on http://www.precipiodx.com/accreditations.html. The laboratory operations are governed by Standard Operating Procedure manuals, or SOPs, which detail each aspect of the laboratory environment including the work flow, quality control, maintenance, and safety. These SOPs are reviewed and approved annually and signed off by the laboratory manager and medical director.

Among the various federal and state laws and regulations that may govern or impact our current and planned operations are the following:
Reimbursement

As blood-related cancers are more likely to be developed later in life, the largest insurance provider is Medicare, which constitutes approximately 40% of our patients’ cases. Non-Medicare patients are typically insured by private insurance companies who provide patient coverage and pay for patients’ health-related costs. These private insurance companies will often adjust their rates according to the insurance rates annually published by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. We, and other providers, typically bill according to the codes relevant to the tests we conduct.
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
Many of the services that we provide are reimbursed by Medicare and state Medicaid programs and are therefore subject to extensive government regulation.

Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s disease. Medicaid programs are jointly funded by the federal and state governments and are administered by states under approved plans.

Medicaid provides medical benefits to eligible people with limited income and resources and people with disabilities, among others. Although the federal government establishes general guidelines for the Medicaid program, each state sets its own guidelines regarding eligibility and covered services. Some individuals, known as “dual eligibles”, may be eligible for benefits under both Medicare and a state Medicaid program. Reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is contingent on the satisfaction of numerous rules and regulations, including those requiring certification and/or licensure. Congress often enacts legislation that affects the reimbursement rates under government healthcare programs.

Approximately 40% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was derived directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs. Also, we indirectly provide services to beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored healthcare programs through managed care entities. Should there be material changes to federal or state reimbursement methodologies, regulations or policies, our direct reimbursements from government-sponsored healthcare programs, as well as service fees that relate indirectly to such reimbursements, could be adversely affected.

Healthcare Reform
In recent years, federal and state governments have considered and enacted policy changes designed to reform the healthcare industry. The most prominent of these healthcare reform efforts, the Affordable Care Act, has resulted in sweeping changes to the U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care. As currently structured, the Affordable Care Act increases the number of persons covered under government programs and private insurance; furnishes economic incentives for measurable improvements in health care quality outcomes; promotes a more integrated health care delivery system and the creation of new health care delivery.
Research and Development Expenses
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $1.2 million, respectively, of research and development expenses. More information regarding our research and development activities can be found in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Item 7 of this Annual Report.
