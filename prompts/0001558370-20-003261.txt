ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
Summary of Business Results and Plans
On September 17, 2019 a holding company reorganization was completed in which Famous Dave’s of America, Inc. (“FDA”) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent holding company named BBQ Holdings, Inc. (“BBQ Holdings”). As used in this Form 10-K, “Company”, “we” and “our” refer to BBQ Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries. BBQ Holdings was incorporated on March 29, 2019 under the laws of the State of Minnesota, while FDA was incorporated in Minnesota on March 14, 1994. The Company develops, owns, operates and franchises restaurants under the name “Famous Dave’s”, “Clark Crew BBQ”, “Granite City Food & Brewery” and “Real Urban Barbecue.” As of December 29, 2019, there were 128 Famous Dave’s restaurants operating in 32 states, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates, including 32 Company-owned restaurants and 96 franchise-operated restaurants. The first Clark Crew BBQ restaurant opened in December 2019 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On March 16, 2020, we purchased one Real Urban Barbecue restaurant located in Vernon Hills, Illinois. On March 9, 2020, we purchased 18 Granite City Food & Brewery restaurants in connection with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
Unless otherwise designated, the following description of our business relates to the Famous Dave’s restaurant operation. The following table summarizes the changes in the number of Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018:

As of December 29, 2019, BBQ Holdings restaurants operated in 32 states, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. 
In fiscal 2019, we continued our focus on increasing sales and traffic through various initiatives. These initiatives included; New SMS text platform, Daily Deals promotion targeted at driving weekly dine-in traffic, Plant-Based menu limited-time offering, new menu item testing, continued testing of restaurant refreshes and enhancing our online ordering experience. Off-Premise was a key driver of our sales growth and we continued to expand on these capabilities while also driving adoption in our franchise community. 
​
In October of 2018, we launched our new menu including an average of 10 new menu items across our system. In 2019, we continued to focus and analyze these items while also testing new items like Pretzels and Bratwurst. We also rolled out our Game Day Sampler, which was a “finger-food” based platter utilized as a promotion for various sporting events throughout the year. 
​
In the second quarter of 2019, we launched an SMS-Text program in order to increase frequency and simplify our interaction with loyal guests. This program was a large success in driving traffic and we look to continue building on this program in fiscal 2020. 
​
In fiscal 2020 we will continue our focus on driving sales by expanding on 2019 initiatives along with a new menu pricing strategy and continuing our restaurant refresh program. We are also working diligently to drive unit level margins with a focus on managing controllable costs in our restaurants. We believe continued adoption of technology will help offset increases in labor costs and working to streamline back-of-house operations. Some of these technology tests include; Handheld tablets, Kitchen Display Systems, Tabletop ordering and Kiosks. 
​
In Fiscal 2019, our Franchisees opened two small format Restaurants and Famous Dave’s opened one. We look to continue evaluating these prototypes in fiscal 2020 for continued unit growth. 
 ​
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to certain metrics of our franchise-operated restaurants; however, franchise-operated restaurants are not owned by us and therefore are not included in our consolidated results of operations and financial position. We believe that disclosure of certain information related to franchise-operated restaurants provides useful information to investors as the performance of franchise-operated restaurants directly impacts royalty and other revenues that we receive from our franchisees and has an impact on the perceived success and value of the Famous Dave’s brand.
Financial Information about Segments
Since its inception, our revenue, operating income and assets have been attributable to the single industry segment of the foodservice industry. Our revenue and operating results for each of the last two fiscal years, and our assets for each of the last two fiscal years, are disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Narrative Description of Business
Famous Dave’s restaurants, a majority of which offer full table service, feature wood-smoked and off-the-grill entrée favorites that fit into the barbeque category. We differentiate ourselves by providing high-quality food in distinctive and comfortable environments with signature décor and signage. As of December 29, 2019, 25 of our Company-owned restaurants are full-service and 5 are counter-service. Our prototypical design includes a designated bar, a signature exterior smokestack, a separate entrance for our To Go business and a patio. The Famous Dave’s concept can be adapted to fit various location sizes and desired service styles such as full-service or counter-service.
In fiscal 2019, our franchisees opened a Famous Dave’s restaurant in El Centro, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, Provo, Utah, and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. In fiscal 2019, Famous Dave’s opened a location in Minneapolis, Minnesota to replace the Calhoun Square location, which closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018, our franchisees opened a restaurant in El Paso, Texas and Fort Mill, South Carolina. In fiscal 2020 we may look to

incentivize our franchisees to open additional restaurants. We offer conversion packages that provide our franchisees with the flexibility to convert existing restaurants as well as existing retail footprints into a Famous Dave’s restaurant. Given the flexibility and scalability of our concept, we believe that there are a variety of development opportunities available now and in the future.
We pride ourselves on the following:
High Quality Food – Each restaurant features a distinctive selection of authentic hickory-smoked and off-the-grill barbecue favorites, such as flame-grilled St. Louis-style and baby back ribs, Texas beef brisket, Georgia chopped pork, country-roasted chicken and signature sandwiches and salads. Also, enticing side items, such as corn bread, potato salad, coleslaw and Wilbur BeansTM, accompany the broad entrée selection. Handmade desserts, including BBQ Holdings Bread Pudding and Banana Pudding, are another specialty. To complement our entrée and appetizer items and to suit different customer tastes, we offer six regional barbeque sauces: Rich & Sassy®, Texas PitTM, Georgia MustardTM, Devil’s Spit®, Sweet and ZestyTM and Wilbur’s RevengeTM. These sauces, in addition to a variety of seasonings, rubs, marinades and other items are also distributed in retail grocery stores throughout the country under licensing agreements.
Focus on Guest Experience – We believe that a renewed focus on enhancing our Guests’ experience and listening to their feedback is essential. In fiscal 2018, we remodeled our Coon Rapids location, including a new design, color scheme, furniture, audio visual, fixtures & equipment and a revised menu with over 20 new items. We believe a positive Guest experience, combined with our high-quality food, makes BBQ Holdings appealing to a diverse and broad demographic profile. In fiscal 2019, we remodeled two additional locations in Minnetonka, MN and Westbury NY. These remodels tested a new modern design including wall murals, lighter and more welcoming dining rooms and upgraded lighting. We expect to continue refreshing restaurants in 2020. Throughout 2018, we implemented various guest facing initiatives and in 2019, we worked on enhancing those items. In addition to our Mobile App, we rolled a SMS-Text program, and enhanced our Online ordering experience. 
Distinctive Environment - Décor and Music – Our original décor theme was a nostalgic roadhouse shack (“Original Shack”), as defined by the abundant use of rustic antiques and Americana items. This format was used for both full-service and counter-service restaurant formats. In late 1997, we introduced the “Lodge” format which featured décor reminiscent of a comfortable “Northwoods” hunting lodge with a full-service dining room and small bar. We have evolved our format to that of a full-service concept with several “prototypical” designs that incorporate the best attributes of the past restaurants while providing a consistent brand image. Our Coon Rapids remodel showcases a modern, contemporary vibe that we believe will appeal to a younger demographic while still resonating with our current core Guest. We continued these enhancements in 2019, with Minnetonka and Westbury. Our franchise partners also remodeled 10 units across 2019 with these new elements. We have an additional eight Corporate remodels planned for 2020. 
Granite City Food & Brewery – Founded in 1999 as a single store restaurant in St. Cloud, Minnesota, the Granite City brand has built a strong reputation in the Midwest for its award-winning craft beer and made-from-scratch craft food. Granite City’s menu is chef driven and designed to introduce guests to innovative new cuisine choices and flavor profiles. This concept has separated itself from competition in the casual dining segment through its offering of craft beer expertise, on-site brewing and exceptional Guest experience.
Operating Strategy
Our ability to achieve sustainable profitable growth is dependent upon delivering high-quality experiences in terms of food and hospitality, consistently. Key elements of our strategy include the following:
Operational Excellence – During fiscal 2019, we continued to focus on operational excellence and integrity, and on creating a consistently enjoyable Guest experience, both in terms of food and hospitality, across our system. We define operational excellence as unyielding commitment to superior service for our Guests during every visit. We continue to look for ways to provide convenience and value to our Guests through reducing ticket times and streamlining

off-premise operations. Operational excellence involves daily monitoring to ensure we execute our recipes at a high level inclusive of preparation, cooking, and handling procedures, rotation, sanitation, cleanliness and safety.
Our Famous Dave’s menu focuses on a number of popular smoked, barbequed, grilled meats, entrée items and delicious side dishes which are prepared using proprietary seasonings, sauces and mixes. In order to enhance our appeal, expand our audience, increase frequency, and feature our cravable products, our culinary team has developed a product pipeline, which will allow us to offer new exciting items throughout the year. In fiscal 2019, we continued our analysis of the new Famous Dave’s menu items launched in 2018 while also testing some new items like Pretzels, Bratwurst, and plant based menu items.
Human Resources and Training/Development - A key ingredient to our success lies with our ability to hire, train, engage and retain employees at all levels of our organization. We place a great deal of importance on creating an exceptional working environment for all of our employees. Through our human resource and training and development resources, tools and programs, we continually enhance and support superior performance within our restaurants and support center.
We are a performance-based organization, committed to recognizing and rewarding performance at all levels of the organization. Our performance management process includes performance calibration as a means of providing measurable, comparative employee evaluations relative to peer contribution, taking into account specific core competencies and goals. It is designed to provide a complete picture of performance that is consistent across the organization. We offer a total rewards program that is benchmarked closely against the industry and includes health and welfare coverage, 401(k) and non-qualified deferred compensation with a company match, base pay and incentive pay programs developed to sustain our competitive position in the market. Our human resource and training teams focus on the selection and retention of talent through programs in overall workforce planning, performance management, development, safety and risk reduction, and continued enhancements in our organizational structures for all positions in the business.
In the training and development arena, we offer a variety of ongoing on-the-job and classroom and eLearning training programs for the operations teams (hourly employees, restaurant managers) in an effort to create defined career paths. Our management training program provides new restaurant managers a foundational-based training for restaurant operations and several learning sessions focused on the basic behaviors and skills of a manager. As an enhancement to our current management training curricula, in 2020 we are preparing to offer a series of general manager workshops for all of our corporate and franchise general managers with the goal of increasing knowledge specific to the brand and overall skill enhancement that will further develop and hone in on skills acquired during the original management training experience and those specific to the role of the general manager.
Restaurant Operations
Our ability to manage multiple restaurants in geographically diverse locations is central to our overall success. In each market, we place specific emphasis on the position of general manager, and seek talented individuals that bring a diverse set of skills, knowledge, and experience to our company. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the careful training and supervision of employees and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to performance, food and beverage preparation, and maintenance of facilities.
All managers must complete an eight-week training program, during which they are instructed in areas such as food quality and preparation, customer service, hospitality, and employee relations. We have prepared operations manuals relating to food and beverage quality and service standards. New employees participate in training under the supervision of our management. We have a vice president of operations who is responsible for overseeing all Company-owned restaurants. This individual as well as our area directors, work closely with the general managers to support day-to-day restaurant operations. In addition, the vice president and area directors assist in the professional development of our general managers and are instrumental in driving our vision of operational integrity and contributing to the improvement of results achieved at our restaurants, including building sales, developing personnel and growing profits. The area directors oversee 10-12 locations and report to our vice president of operations. Our vice president of operations reports directly to our senior vice president of operations at BBQ Holdings.

Off-Premise Occasions - Focus on Convenience
In addition to our lively and entertaining dine-in experience, we provide our Guests with maximum convenience by offering an expedient take-out service along with catering and delivery. We believe that Famous Dave’s entrées and side dishes are viewed by Guests as traditional American "picnic foods" that maintain their quality and travel particularly well, making them an attractive choice to replace a home-cooked meal. The high quality, fair prices and avoidance of preparation time make take-out of our product particularly attractive. Our off-premise sales provide us with revenue opportunities beyond our in-house seating capacity and we continue to seek ways to leverage these segments of our business. We see catering and delivery as a tremendous opportunity for new consumers to access our business. Every restaurant has dedicated vehicles to support our catering initiatives and many restaurants are served by multiple third-party delivery providers.
Our restaurants have been designed specifically to accommodate a significant level of To Go sales, including a separate To Go entrance with prominent and distinct signage, and, for added convenience, we separately staff the To Go counter. To further enhance To Go sales, we offer our Guest the ability to order online to improve convenience. We believe our focus on To Go enables Famous Dave’s to capture a greater portion of the “take-out” market by allowing consumers to “trade within our brand,” when dining in is not always an option. We pursue efforts to increase awareness of To Go in all Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants by featuring signage and merchandising both inside and outside the restaurants. Additionally, we contract with several Delivery Service Providers (“DSP”) to offer our Guests additional methods for receiving our food.
Guest Satisfaction – We believe that we achieve a significant level of repeat business by providing high-quality food, efficient friendly service, and warm caring hospitality in an entertaining environment at moderate prices. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the purposeful hiring, training and supervision of personnel and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards of performance, food preparation and facility maintenance. We have also built family-friendly strategies into each restaurant’s food, service and design by providing children’s menus, smaller-sized entrees at reduced prices and changing tables in restrooms.
Value Proposition and Guest Frequency – We offer high quality food and a distinctive atmosphere at competitive prices to encourage frequent patronage. Lunch and dinner entrees range from $6.99 to $27.99, resulting in a per person dine-in and To Go average of $15.63 during fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2019, the per person dine-in and To Go tickets for lunch averaged $14.09 and for dinner averaged $16.73. We launched a “Famous Deals” program in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 intended to drive weekday dine-in traffic. These offers ranged from $3 burgers to $2 ribs on different days of the week. We had a great deal of success driving dine-in traffic on these days, and we intend to continue the program in fiscal 2020 while tweaking the offers quarterly. In addition, we intend to use value priced offerings, loyalty based incentives, new product introductions, and the convenience of connecting with Guests on their own terms, to drive new and infrequent Guests into our restaurants for additional meal occasions.
Marketing, Promotion and Sales
We believe that by specializing in unique and distinctive smoked meats, poultry & fish, our menu specialty helps set the brand apart from the crowded field in casual dining. To further develop the advertising and promotional materials and programs designed to create brand awareness and increase the reach of the brand, we have a system-wide marketing fund. All Company-owned restaurants, and those franchise-operated restaurants with agreements signed after December 17, 2003 are generally required to contribute 1.0% of net sales to this fund, which substantially funds the marketing and digital teams. In fiscal 2019, the Marketing Ad Fund contribution for contributing franchisees was 1.0% of net sales and will continue to be so in fiscal 2020.
The marketing team, working with outside agencies and other resources, is responsible for the advertising, promotion, creative development, and branding for Famous Dave’s. Franchise-operated restaurants place the advertising and marketing programs in their local markets based on contractual requirements. Famous Dave’s uses industry standard marketing efforts that include brand and graphic design, broadcast media, digital, online & social media platforms, public relations and out-of-home vehicles.

The strategic focus for marketing and promotion is to ensure that Famous Dave’s is recognized as the category–defining brand in barbeque, to create and sustain attractive differentiation in consumer’s mind, and to continue to strengthen the brand’s positioning and consistency. To help drive top-line sales, we have selectively tested discount based promotional activity across various channels. Given the results in 2019 we believe there is a place for limited discounting to increase frequency and drive traffic. 
In 2019, we highlighted value and affordability in our menu along with promoting additional value offerings through limited time offers. We also continued to promote our To Go and Catering offering while rolling out delivery on a large-scale basis. This has allowed us to connect with Guests on their terms and offer unique and often compelling sources of growth, and each occasion is growing at a different rate.
Location Strategy
We believe that the barbeque segment of the casual dining restaurant industry continues to offer strong growth opportunities, and we believe we are positioned for growth on a geographical basis. Our geographical concentration, as of December 29, 2019, was 41% Midwest, 9% Middle Atlantic, 10% South, 33% West, 4% Northeast and 4% International.
We prepare an overall market development strategy for each market. The creation of this market strategy starts with identifying trade areas that align demographically with the target Guest profile. The identified trade areas are then assessed for viability and vitality and prioritized by sales and unit level margin opportunity for future development. Since markets are dynamic, the market strategy includes a continual and ongoing assessment of all existing restaurant locations. If financially feasible, a restaurant may be relocated as the retail or residential focus in a trade area shifts.
In fiscal 2019, our franchisees opened two small format restaurant prototypes and BBQ Holdings opened one. All three restaurants have slight variations in menu and service style so we can analyze these results. These restaurants will help us shape our future unit growth. 
These new service models will allow us to access new markets or strategically locate restaurants in existing markets where a full-service restaurant is unlikely to be financially viable. The surrounding trade area will determine which service style is appropriate. Site selection will focus on converting second-generation space cost effectively. We intend to finance company restaurant development through the use of cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations, through availability on our revolving line of credit and future additional debt.
We expect to continue to grow our Famous Dave’s franchise program. Our goal is to continue to improve the economics of our current restaurant prototypes, while providing more cost-effective development options for our franchisees. Our franchise system is a significant part of our brand’s success. As such, another one of our goals is to be a valued franchisor; to enhance communication and recognition of best practices throughout the system and to continue to expand our franchisee network domestically and internationally.
Purchasing
In order to maximize quality and operational efficiencies for our food products, we strive to obtain consistent quality items at competitive prices from reliable sources, including identifying secondary suppliers for many of our key products. Additionally, our secondary suppliers help us assure supply chain integrity and better logistics. Finally, to reduce freight costs, we continually aim to optimize our distribution networks, where the products are shipped directly to the restaurants through our foodservice distributors. Each restaurant’s management team determines the daily quantities of food items needed and orders such quantities to be delivered to their restaurant.
Approximately 85% of our food and non-alcoholic beverage purchases are on contract, with the majority being proteins. Pork represents approximately 37% of our total purchases, while beef, which includes hamburger and brisket, is approximately 19%, chicken is approximately 14%, and seafood is approximately 3%.

8



Our purchasing team is also responsible for managing the procurement of non-food items for our restaurants, including restaurant equipment, smallwares and restaurant supplies. They also contract many of our restaurants repair and maintenance services along with managing our utility costs.
Information Technology
We recognize the importance of leveraging information and technology to support and extend our competitive position in the restaurant industry. We continue to invest in initiatives that provide secure and efficient operations, enhance the Guest experience and provide benchmarks that allow us to evaluate our operational metrics.
We utilize industry-leading service providers and cloud services to streamline processes at both the restaurant and support center. Interfaces between point-of-sale (“POS”), labor management, inventory management, menu management, digital platforms and financial systems are the foundation of our enterprise analytics platform. We also continue to implement and support solutions to capitalize on current digital market trends to drive sales and realize operational efficiency.
Trademarks
Our company has registered various trademarks, makes use of various unregistered marks, and intends to vigorously defend these marks. We highly value our trademarks, trade names and service marks and will defend against any improper use of its marks to the fullest extent allowable by law.
Franchise Program
Our growth and success depends in part upon our ability to attract, contract with and retain qualified franchisees. It also depends upon the ability of those franchisees to successfully operate their restaurants with our standards of quality and promote and develop Famous Dave’s brand awareness.
 Although we have established criteria to evaluate prospective franchisees, and our franchise agreements include certain operating standards, each franchisee operates his or her restaurants independently. Various laws limit our ability to influence the day-to-day operation of our franchise restaurants. We cannot assure you that the franchisees will be able to successfully operate BBQ Holdings restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards for operational excellence, service and food quality.

Our franchise operations department is led by our senior vice president of operations, who guides the efforts of our director of franchise operations and two franchise business consultants. The director of franchise operations and franchise business consultants have the responsibility of supporting our franchisees throughout the system and play a critical role for us as well as for our franchise community. The director of franchise operations and franchise business consultants manage the relationship between us and our franchisees and provides an understanding of the roles, responsibilities, differences, and accountabilities of that relationship. They are active participants towards enhancing performance, as they partner in strategic and operations planning sessions with our franchise partners and review the individual strategies and tactics for obtaining superior performance for the franchisee. They ensure compliance with obligations under our area development and franchise agreements. Franchisees are encouraged to utilize all available assistance from the franchise business consultants and the support center but are not required to do so.
We have a comprehensive operations scorecard and training tool that helps us measure the operational effectiveness of our Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants. This scorecard is used to evaluate, monitor and improve operations in areas such as Guest satisfaction, health and safety standards, community involvement, and local store marketing effectiveness, among other operating metrics. Also, we generally provide support as it relates to all aspects of franchise operations including, but not limited to, store openings and operating performance. Finally, we solicit feedback from our franchise system by having an active dialogue with all franchisees throughout the year.
The franchisee’s investment depends primarily upon restaurant size. This investment includes the area development fee, initial franchise fee, real estate and leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment, POS systems, business licenses, deposits, initial food inventory, smallwares, décor and training fees as well as working capital. In fiscal 2019, certain franchisees were required to contribute 1.0% of net sales to a marketing fund dedicated to providing digital and creative services. Currently, franchisees are required to spend approximately 1.5% of their net sales annually on local marketing activities.
Seasonality
Our restaurants typically generate higher revenue in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year as a result of seasonal traffic increases and high catering sales experienced during the summer months, and lower revenue in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, due to possible adverse weather which can disrupt Guest and team member transportation to our restaurants.
Government Regulation
Our company is subject to extensive state and local government regulation by various governmental agencies, including state and local licensing, zoning, land use, construction and environmental regulations and various regulations relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages, sanitation, disposal of refuse and waste products, public health, safety and fire standards. Our restaurants are subject to periodic inspections by governmental agencies to ensure conformity with such regulations. Any difficulty or failure to obtain required licensing or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant, and the suspension of, or inability to renew a license, could interrupt operations at an existing restaurant, any of which would adversely affect our operations. Restaurant operating costs are also affected by other government actions that are beyond our control, including increases in minimum hourly wage requirements, worker’s compensation insurance rates, health care insurance costs, property and casualty insurance, and unemployment and other taxes. We are also subject to “dram-shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We are also subject to extensive state and federal government regulation by various governmental agencies due to our digital and social media footprint in the collection of customer’s or potential customer’s data. This includes data storage and privacy laws on a state and federal basis.
As a franchisor, we are subject to federal regulation and certain state laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements, including limitations on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. As proposed, such legislation would limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise, and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply.

The 1990 Federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. We have in the past and could in the future be required to incur costs to modify our restaurants in order to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for, disabled persons. Our restaurants are currently designed to be accessible to the disabled, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to this Act.
Team Members
As of December 29, 2019, we employed approximately 1,677 team members of which approximately 172 were salaried full-time employees. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relationships with our team members.
