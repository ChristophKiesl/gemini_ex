Item 1. Business
Avnet, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a global technology distributor and solutions company that supports customers at every stage of the product lifecycle, from idea to design and from prototype to production. Avnet’s unique position at the center of the technology value chain enables the company to accelerate the design and supply stages of product development so customers can realize revenue faster. Founded in 1921, the Company works with suppliers in every major technology segment to serve 2.1 million customers in more than 140 countries.
For a century, Avnet has helped its customers and suppliers realize the transformative possibilities of technology while continually expanding the breadth and depth of its capabilities. Avnet can support every stage of the electronic product lifecycle and serves a wide range of customers: from startups and mid-sized businesses to enterprise-level original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers, and original design manufacturers (“ODMs”). 
Organizational Structure
Avnet has two primary operating groups — Electronic Components (“EC”) and Farnell. Both operating groups have operations in each of the three major economic regions of the world: (i) the Americas, (ii) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) and (iii) Asia/Pacific (“Asia”). Each operating group has its own management team, who manage various functions within each operating group. Each operating group also has distinct financial reporting to the executive level, which informs operating decisions and strategic planning and resource allocation for the Company as a whole. Divisions (“business units”) within each operating group serve primarily as sales and marketing units to streamline sales efforts and enhance each operating group’s ability to work with its customers and suppliers, generally along more specific geographies or product lines. However, each business unit relies heavily on support services from the operating groups, as well as centralized support at the corporate level. 
A description of each operating group is presented below. Further financial information by operating group is provided in Note 17 “Segment information” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Electronic Components
Avnet’s EC operating group primarily supports high-volume customers. It markets, sells, and distributes electronic components from the world’s leading electronic component manufacturers, including semiconductors, IP&E components (interconnect, passive and electromechanical components), and other integrated and embedded components.
EC serves a variety of markets ranging from automotive to medical to defense and aerospace. It offers an array of customer support options throughout the entire product lifecycle, including both turnkey and customized design, supply chain, new product introduction, programming, logistics and post-sales services.

Competition & Markets
The electronic components industry continues to be extremely competitive. The Company’s major competitors include: Arrow Electronics, Inc., Future Electronics, World Peace Group, Mouser Electronics and Digi-Key Electronics. There are also certain smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on particular sectors or on narrower geographic locations, markets, or products. As a result of these factors, Avnet’s pricing and product availability must remain competitive.
A key competitive factor in the electronic component distribution industry is the need to carry a sufficient amount and selection of inventory to meet customers’ demand and rapid delivery requirements. To minimize its exposure related to inventory on hand, the Company purchases a majority of its products pursuant to franchised distribution agreements, which typically provide certain protections for product obsolescence and price erosion. These agreements are generally cancelable upon 30 to 180 days’ notice and, in most cases, provide for or require inventory return privileges upon cancellation. In addition, the Company enhances its competitive position by offering a variety of value-added services, which are tailored to individual customer specifications and business needs, such as point of use replenishment, testing, assembly, programming, supply chain management, and materials management.
A competitive advantage is the breadth of the Company’s supplier product line card. Because of the number of Avnet’s suppliers, many customers can simplify their procurement process and make all of their required purchases from Avnet, rather than purchasing from several different parties.
Seasonality
Historically, Avnet’s business has not been materially impacted by seasonality, with the exception of an impact on consolidated results from shifts in regional sales trends from Asia in the first half of a fiscal year to the Americas and EMEA regions in the second half of a fiscal year.
Number of Employees
As of July 3, 2021, Avnet had approximately 14,500 employees, compared to 14,600 employees on June 27, 2020, and 15,500 employees on June 29, 2019.
