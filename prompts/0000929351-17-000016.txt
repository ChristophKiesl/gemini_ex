ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview
Lionsgate is a vertically integrated next generation global content leader with a diversified presence in motion picture production and distribution, television programming and syndication, premium pay television networks, home entertainment, global distribution and sales, interactive ventures and games and location-based entertainment.
On December 8, 2016, Lionsgate and Starz consummated a merger pursuant to which we acquired Starz for a combination of cash and common stock. Following the merger, we reorganized our segment structure and now manage and report our operating results through three reportable business segments: Motion Pictures, Television Production and Media Networks.
Motion Pictures
Our Motion Pictures segment includes revenues derived from the following:

• | Theatrical. Theatrical revenues are derived from the domestic theatrical release of motion pictures licensed to theatrical exhibitors on a picture-by-picture basis (distributed by us directly in the United States and through a sub-distributor in Canada).


• | Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale and rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films and certain television programs (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) on packaged media and through digital media platforms. In addition, we have revenue sharing arrangements with certain digital media platforms which generally provide that, in exchange for a nominal or no upfront sales price, we share in the rental or sales revenues generated by the platform on a title-by-title basis. Home entertainment revenue consists of packaged and digital media revenue. We distribute a library of approximately 16,000 motion picture titles and television episodes and programs.


• | Television. Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the linear pay, basic cable and free television markets.


• | International. International revenues are derived from the licensing of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles from our international subsidiaries to international distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis. International revenues also include revenues from the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films, and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom


• | Other. Other revenues are derived from our interactive ventures and games division, our global franchise management and strategic partnerships division (which includes location-based entertainment), the sales and licensing of music from the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcast of our productions, and from the licensing of our film and television content to ancillary markets.

Television Production
Our Television Production segment includes revenues derived from the following (which does not include revenue from Starz original programming, other than programming that is or may be produced by Lionsgate’s legacy television production group and licensed to Starz):

• | Domestic Television. Domestic television revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to domestic markets of one-hour and half-hour scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming.


• | International. International revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to international markets of one-hour and half-hour scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming.

• | Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of television production movies or series on packaged media and through digital media platforms. We distribute a library of approximately 16,000 motion picture titles and television episodes and programs.


• | Other. Other revenues are derived from product integration in our television episodes and programs, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from the licensing of our television programs to ancillary markets.

Media Networks
Our Media Networks segment includes revenues derived from the following:

• | Starz Networks. Starz Networks’ revenues are derived from the distribution of our STARZ branded premium subscription video services pursuant to affiliation agreements with U.S. multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), including cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunications companies, online video providers (collectively, “Distributors”), and on an over-the-top (“OTT”) basis. Starz Networks’ revenue is recognized in the period during which programming is provided, either: (i) based solely on the total number of subscribers who receive our services multiplied by rates specified in the affiliation agreements; (ii) based on amounts or rates specified in the affiliation agreements which are not tied solely to the total number of subscribers who receive our services, or (iii) the total number of subscribers who receive our OTT service multiplied by the applicable retail rate.


• | Content and Other. Original content revenues are derived from the licensing of Starz original programming to digital media platforms, international television networks, through packaged media and other ancillary markets.


• | Streaming Services. Streaming services revenues are derived from the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming services on subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) platforms.

Segment Revenue
For the year ended March 31, 2017, contributions to the Company’s consolidated revenues from its reporting segments included Motion Pictures 60.0%, Television Production 26.2% and Media Networks 14.3%. 
* Includes revenues from the Lionsgate legacy SVOD platforms and Starz revenue from the December 8, 2016 date of acquisition.
Within the Motion Pictures segment, revenues were generated from the following: Theatrical 19.3%, Home Entertainment 36.8%, Television 14.5%, International 27.8% and Motion Pictures-Other 1.5%.

Corporate Strategy
We continue to grow and diversify our portfolio of content to capitalize on demand from traditional and emerging platforms throughout the world. We maintain a disciplined approach to acquisition, production and distribution of content, by balancing our financial risks against the probability of commercial success for each project. We pursue the same disciplined approach to investments in, and acquisition of, libraries and other assets complementary to our business. We believe that our strategic focus on content and creation of innovative content distribution strategies will enhance our competitive position in the industry, ensure optimal use of our capital, build a diversified foundation for future growth and generate significant long-term value for our shareholders.

MOTION PICTURES
Motion Pictures - Theatrical
Theatrical Production
Theatrical production consists of “greenlighting” (proceeding with production) and financing motion pictures, as well as the development of screenplays, filming activities and the post-filming editing/post-production process.
We take a disciplined approach to theatrical production with the goal of producing content that can be distributed through various domestic and international platforms. We typically attempt to mitigate the financial risk associated with production by negotiating co-financing development and co-production agreements (which provide for joint efforts and cost-sharing between us and one or more third-party companies) and pre-licensing international distribution rights on a selective basis, including through international output agreements (which refers to licensing the rights to distribute a film in one or more media generally for a limited term, in one or more specific territories prior to completion of the film). We also often attempt to minimize production exposure by structuring agreements with talent that provide for them to participate in the financial success of the motion picture in exchange for reducing guaranteed amounts that would be paid regardless of the film's success (referred to as “up-front payments”). In addition, many states and foreign countries have implemented incentive programs designed to attract film production as a means of economic development. Government incentives typically take the form of sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits, low interest loans, direct subsidies or cash rebates, which are generally calculated based on the amount of money spent in the particular jurisdiction in connection with the production. Each jurisdiction determines the regulations that must be complied with, as well as the conditions that must be satisfied, in order for a production to qualify for the incentive. We use such incentives and/ or programs and other structures to further reduce our financial risk in theatrical production.
Our approach to acquiring films for theatrical release is similar to our approach to film production. We generally seek to limit our financial exposure in acquiring films while adding films of quality and commercial viability to our release schedule and library.

Theatrical Distribution
In general, the economic life of a motion picture consists of its exploitation in theaters, on packaged media and on various digital and television platforms in territories around the world.
Theatrical distribution refers to the marketing and commercial or retail exploitation of motion pictures. We distribute motion pictures directly to movie theaters in the U.S. Generally, distributors and exhibitors will enter into agreements whereby the exhibitor retains a portion of the “gross box office receipts,” which are the admissions paid at the box office. The balance is remitted to the distributor. Concurrent with their release in the U.S., motion pictures are generally released in Canada and may also be released in one or more other foreign markets. After the initial theatrical release, distributors seek to maximize revenues by releasing movies in sequential release date windows, which may be exclusive against other non-theatrical distribution channels.
In most territories, international theatrical distribution (outside of the U.S. and Canada) generally follows the same cycle as domestic theatrical distribution. Historically, the international distribution cycle would begin a few months after the start of the domestic distribution cycle. However, due in part to international box office growth, as well as film piracy in international markets, a much higher percentage of films are being released simultaneously in the U.S. and international markets, or even earlier in certain international markets.
We construct release schedules taking into account moviegoer attendance patterns and competition from other studios' scheduled theatrical releases. We use either wide (generally, more than 2,000 screens nationwide) or limited initial releases, depending on the film. We believe that we generally spend significantly less on prints and advertising for a given film than other studios and design our marketing plans to cost-effectively reach a large audience.
Producing, marketing and distributing a motion picture can involve significant risks and costs, and can cause our financial results to vary depending on the timing of a motion picture’s release. For example, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. Therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film’s theatrical exhibition, and profitability for the film may not be realized until after its theatrical release window.
We may revise the release date of a motion picture as the production schedule changes or in such a manner as we believe is likely to maximize revenues or for other business reasons. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any of the motion pictures scheduled for release will be completed, that completion will occur in accordance with the anticipated schedule or budget, or that the film will ever be released.
Theatrical Releases 
In fiscal 2017 (i.e., the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017), we released the following 18 films theatrically in the U.S., which included both Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment label films developed and produced in-house, films co-developed and co-produced and films acquired from third parties:

Over the last 15 years, Lionsgate, Summit Entertainment and affiliated companies have distributed films that have earned 122 Academy Award ® nominations, won 30 Academy Awards and have been nominated for and won numerous Golden Globe ® Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards ®, BAFTA Awards and Independent Spirit Awards.
Motion Pictures - Home Entertainment
Our U.S. home entertainment distribution operation exploits our film and television content library of approximately 16,000 motion picture titles and television episodes and programs, consisting of titles from, among others, Lionsgate, our subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures (such as Starz, Summit Entertainment, Anchor Bay Entertainment, Artisan Entertainment, CodeBlack Films, Grindstone Entertainment Group, Modern Entertainment, Trimark, Pantelion Films and Roadside Attractions), as well as titles from third parties such as A&E, AMC, LeapFrog Entertainment, Marvel, MGA Entertainment, Miramax, Saban Entertainment, StudioCanal, Tyler Perry Studios, The Weinstein Company and Zoetrope Corporation. Home entertainment revenue consists of packaged media and digital revenue.
Packaged Media
Packaged media distribution involves the marketing, promotion and sale and/or lease of DVDs/Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers who then sell or rent the DVDs/Blu-ray discs to consumers for private viewing. Fulfillment of physical distribution services are outsourced substantially to Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. 
For new theatrical titles, home entertainment distribution has traditionally occurred within three to four months of initial theatrical release. However, due in part to new methods of distribution and the rise of new digital platforms and networks, select titles are being released on VOD and other digital formats on the same day as the title is theatrically released (a “day & date” release strategy). These titles typically release on a modest number of screens for the purpose of positioning VOD and other ancillary platforms. We have also experimented with various other windowing strategies, where, for instance, a title may be released theatrically on several hundred screens, followed by an electronic-sell-through (“EST”) and premium priced interactive VOD window, followed by release on packaged media, regular priced VOD, and later, SVOD. Importantly, these release strategies are not applicable to every film, and may change based on release patterns, new technologies and product flow.
We distribute or sell content directly to retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Costco and others who buy large volumes of our DVDs/Blu-ray discs to sell directly to consumers. Sales to Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 43% of net home entertainment packaged media revenue in fiscal 2017.We also directly distribute content to the rental market through Netflix, Amazon, Redbox and others.

Of these titles, certain are released through our subsidiary, Grindstone Entertainment Group, which acquires and/or produces titles as finished pictures and as “pre-buys” based on script, cast and genres, and creates targeted key art, marketing materials and release plans, which are then distributed direct-to-video, VOD and through other media. In fiscal 2017, Grindstone Entertainment Group released 32 titles.
Additionally, we distribute television product including series such as Ash vs. Evil Dead, Black Sails, Blue Mountain State, Casual, Duck Dynasty, Fear the Walking Dead, Grace and Frankie, Graves, Hannibal, Into the Badlands, Mad Men, Narcos, Nurse Jackie, Orange Is The New Black, Power, Turn: Washington’s Spies, The Royals, The Walking Dead, Weeds, library titles such as Alf and Little House on the Prairie, certain Disney-ABC Domestic Television series, as well as premier children's brands including our Alpha and Omega franchise, the upcoming Norm of the North direct-to-video sequel, Saban Brand’s Power Rangers, Aardman’s Shaun the Sheep library, LeapFrog Entertainment's LeapFrog, MGA Entertainment's LalaLoopsy and Bratz, American Greetings' Care Bears, and our catalog of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Marvel Animated Features.
In fiscal 2017, four of our theatrical releases debuted at number one on DVD/Blu-ray - Gods of Egypt, The Divergent Series: Allegiant, Deepwater Horizon (which held onto the number one spot for two consecutive weeks), and Hacksaw Ridge.
We shipped approximately 85 million DVD/Blu-ray finished units during fiscal 2017. In calendar 2016, we had an approximate 12% market share for home entertainment (which, with Anchor Bay Entertainment from the Starz acquisition date of December 8, 2016, included packaged media, digital media and VOD) making us the number four studio in market share overall. We also maintained a box office-to-home entertainment conversion rate of 20% above the industry average in calendar 2016. Box office-to-home entertainment conversion rate is calculated as the ratio of the total of both first cycle DVD release revenues and total digital platform revenues for a theatrical release compared to the total North American box-office revenues from such theatrical release.
As stated above, we distribute content through Anchor Bay Entertainment, the former global home video sales arm of Starz. Anchor Bay Entertainment acquires and licenses various titles from third parties and also develops and produces certain of its content. Certain of the titles acquired by Anchor Bay Entertainment air on STARZ and STARZ ENCORE networks. Anchor Bay Entertainment also distributes Starz Networks’ original series and titles from The Weinstein Company. Anchor Bay Entertainment has a license agreement with The Weinstein Company for the distribution of The Weinstein Company’s theatrical titles through April 2020. Anchor Bay Entertainment earns a fee for the distribution of such theatrical titles. For more information regarding Starz, see Media Networks below.
Digital Media
Digital media distribution involves delivering content (including certain titles not distributed theatrically or on packaged media) by electronic means directly to consumers in-home and on mobile devices. The key distribution methods today include transactional distribution (such as pay-per-view (“PPV”), EST and transactional video-on-demand (“TVOD,” often just referred to as “VOD”)), non-transactional video-on-demand distribution (such as SVOD), advertiser-supported video-on-demand (“AVOD”) and free video-on-demand (“FVOD”)) as well as distribution through various linear pay, basic cable and free television platforms. 
Transactional digital media distribution of theatrically released motion pictures generally occurs within three to six months of the initial theatrical release. Pay television distribution and/or digital SVOD distribution usually follows within nine months of a movie’s initial theatrical release. Finally, all other linear television and non-transactional digital models commence throughout various windows thereafter. While these current release patterns may not remain static in the future and may change based on release patterns, new technologies and product flow, a film’s lifecycle remains long. A release pattern may look as follows:

We distribute content on pay networks including, among others, Starz, EPIX, HBO and Showtime, and on basic cable networks including, among others, USA Network, FX, Turner Networks, BET, Pop, A&E, SyFy, Lifetime, MTV, Bravo, Comedy Central, DIRECTV, Spike, AMC Networks, Freeform, Reelz, Nickelodeon, Viceland, Bounce, Telemundo and UniMás. We also distribute content to digital platforms and networks such as iTunes, Amazon Instant Video, Wal-Mart's Vudu, Google Play, Microsoft's Xbox, Sony's PlayStation Network, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Valve Corporation’s Steam platform, IAC’s Vimeo platform and iQIYI. We also directly distribute to MVPDs including cable operators (such as Comcast and Charter), satellite television providers (such as DIRECTV and DISH Network) and telecommunications companies (such as Verizon).
We also distribute original and acquired television programming across a variety of digital platforms on an EST basis, often the day after an episode airs on television in the territory. Television content is usually made available transactionally, on digital SVOD, FVOD and AVOD platforms years after such content first airs, generating additional revenues for us and supplementing those revenues earned from traditional linear television distribution.
In fiscal 2017, three of the titles we distribute debuted at number one on the Rentrak On-Demand VOD charts - The Divergent Series: Allegiant, The Hateful Eight (The Weinstein Company/Starz) and Hacksaw Ridge. Additionally, five of our titles reached the number two spot on Rentrak On-Demand VOD charts - Deepwater Horizon, Manchester by the Sea, Dirty Grandpa, Now You See Me 2 and Boo! A Madea Halloween. Moreover, eight of our titles achieved the number one ranking in fiscal 2017 on the iTunes’ Top Movies chart including Dirty Grandpa, Burnt (The Weinstein Company/Starz), The Divergent Series: Allegiant, Hateful Eight (The Weinstein Company/Starz), Now You See Me 2, Deepwater Horizon, Hacksaw Ridge and John Wick: Chapter Two.
Motion Pictures - Television
We license our theatrical productions and acquired films to the domestic linear pay, basic cable and free television markets. For additional information regarding such distribution, see Motion Pictures-Home Entertainment-Digital Media above.
Motion Pictures - International
Our international sales operations are headquartered at our offices in London, England. The primary components of our international business are, on a territory by territory basis through third parties or directly through our international divisions: (i) the licensing of rights in all media of our in-house feature film product on an output basis; (ii) the licensing of rights in all media of our in-house product on a pre-sales basis for non-output territories; (iii) the licensing of third party feature films on an agency basis; and (iv) direct distribution of theatrical and/or ancillary rights licensing.
We license rights in all media on a territory by territory basis (other than the territories where we self-distribute) of (i) our in-house Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment feature film product, and (ii) films produced by third parties such as Black Label Media, CBS Films, Participant Media, River Road Entertainment, Thunder Road Pictures and other independent producers. Films licensed and/or released by us internationally in fiscal 2017 included such in-house productions as Now You See Me 2, Deepwater Horizon, La La Land, Nerve, The Shack, John Wick: Chapter 2, Power Rangers, The Glass Castle, Robin Hood: Origins, American Assassin, Saw Legacy and Kin.  Third party films for which we were engaged as exclusive sales agent and/or released by us internationally in fiscal 2017 included The Last Face, A Monster Calls, Middle School, Horse Soldiers, Entebbe, Captive State, Playmobil, Hotel Artemis and Roman Polanski’s Based on A True Story.
11

Through our pre-sales and output arrangements, we generally cover the majority of the production budget or acquisition cost of new theatrical releases which we distribute internationally. Our output agreements for Lionsgate and Summit feature films currently cover 11 major territories including Australia/New Zealand, Benelux (Belgium/Netherlands/Luxembourg), Canada, CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), Eastern Europe, France, Germany/Austria, Italy, Poland, Scandinavia and Spain. These output agreements generally include all rights for all media (including home entertainment and television rights). We also distribute theatrical titles in Latin America through our partnership with International Distribution Company and certain theatrical titles in China through our relationship with Hunan TV & Broadcast Intermediary Co. In all, our distribution operations cover 13 major international territories.
We also self-distribute motion pictures in the United Kingdom and Ireland through Lionsgate UK. Lionsgate UK has established a reputation in the United Kingdom as a leading producer, distributor and acquirer of commercially successful and critically acclaimed product. In fiscal 2017, Lionsgate UK released the following 19 films theatrically:

Interactive Ventures and Games
Our Interactive Ventures and Games division oversees our interactive business which includes multiplatform games based off our and third party intellectual property, augmented and virtual reality, eSports, and strategic investments in digital businesses including emerging content platforms, eSports franchises and world-class game developers/publishers. 
Over the past few years, we have invested in interactive storytellers Telltale Games, Finnish mobile game developer/publisher Next Games, live mobile gaming platform Mobcrush, a leading eSports franchise Immortals and formed a strategic partnership with Hong Kong based mobile game developer/publisher Fifth Journey.
In gaming, we currently have a slate of over 20 projects in varying stages of development, production and release. Our game releases to date have included Power Rangers: Legacy Wars, a top ranked free to play mobile game developed and published in partnership with Saban Brands and nWay, John Wick Chronicles, an arcade style shooter game in virtual reality developed and published by Starbreeze, and an Orange Is The New Black slot machine game with International Game Technology, which was simultaneously released into their DoubleDown Casino mobile app. We also partnered with Alcon Entertainment, Warner Bros. and Starbreeze to create Point Break game pack extensions for Payday 2 and announced a Reservoir Dogs PC/console game with Big Games, as well as a Kevin Hart social adventure mobile game with Fifth Journey.
In the last two years, we have also launched a broad range of virtual reality (“VR”) initiatives building upon our reputation as early definers of new content platforms and markets. We were the first studio to be announced as an early content partner for HTC Vive and Google Daydream. We also were one of the first two studios to provide EST and VOD titles to Oculus for the launch of their video platform. Our VR slate includes John Wick Chronicles for HTC Vive and VR arcades, a Now You See Me mobile VR game and two unannounced VR games that are expected to launch in calendar 2018. 
We have also positioned ourselves as a leader in the world of eSports through our investments in Immortals and Mobcrush, as well as a content partnership with ESL, the largest eSports promoter in the world. With ESL and Pilgrim Media Group, we expect to develop competitive reality television programming built around the world of eSports.

Global Franchise Management and Strategic Partnerships
Our Global Franchise Management and Strategic Partnership division broadly covers all theatrical and television promotions and branded partnerships, licensed consumer products and location-based entertainment initiatives. Our goal is to drive incremental revenue and deepen fan engagement across our entire portfolio of properties via meaningful brand extensions, a direct model consumer products business and location-based entertainment destinations around the world.

In addition to the two active Lionsgate theme park projects started in 2016 in the United Arab Emirates and China, we entered into a significant agreement to develop multiple Lionsgate branded Family Entertainment Centers in high traffic locations in Europe and the U.S. Also, in fiscal 2017, in collaboration with Saban Brands and based on the new film, we launched a major worldwide Power Rangers consumer products program at key retailers to generate incremental revenue during the movie window. Finally, significant brand partnerships were secured across a broad range of categories with top brands, including Qualcomm, Kellogg’s, Krispy Kreme, AirBnB, and Johnny Rockets to support various theatrical openings with promotional programs and incremental media support throughout fiscal 2017.
Music
Our film and television music departments creatively oversee music for our theatrical and television slates, respectively. Our music strategy is to service the Company’s creative divisions’ music needs, while providing music for use in marketing our films and television shows. For our theatrical slate, the work of the music department includes overseeing songs, scores and soundtracks for all of our productions, co-productions and acquisitions. For our television slate, the work of the music department includes overseeing music staffing, scores and soundtracks for all of our television productions. Music revenues are derived from the sales and licensing of music from our films and television content, and the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcasts of our productions.
Ancillary Revenues
Ancillary revenues are derived from the licensing of non-theatrical uses of our films and television content to distributors who, in turn, make such content available to airlines, hotels, schools, oil rigs, public libraries, prisons, community groups, the armed forces, ships at sea and others.
TELEVISION PRODUCTION
Our television business consists of the development, production, syndication and distribution of television programming. We principally generate revenue from the licensing and distribution of such programming to broadcast television networks, pay and basic cable networks, digital platforms and syndicators of first-run programming, which license programs on a station-by-station basis and pay in cash or via barter (i.e., trade of programming for airtime). Each of these platforms may acquire a mix of original and library programming. 
After initial exhibition, we distribute programming to subsequent buyers, both domestically and internationally, including basic cable network, premium subscription services or digital platforms (known as “off-network syndicated programming”). Off-network syndicated programming can be sold in successive cycles of sales which may occur on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. In addition, television programming is sold on home entertainment (packaged media and via digital delivery) and across all other applicable ancillary revenue streams including music publishing, touring and integration. 
As with film production, we use tax credits, subsidies, and other incentive programs for television production in order to maximize our returns and ensure fiscally responsible production models.
Revenue recorded in the Television Production segment does not include revenue from Starz original programming, other than programming that is or may be produced by Lionsgate’s legacy television production group and licensed to Starz. In fiscal 2017, Lionsgate’s legacy production group did not produce or license programming to Starz. For more information regarding Starz, see Media Networks below.
Television Production - Domestic Television
With the acquisition of Starz, we currently produce, syndicate and distribute nearly 90 television shows on more than 40 networks (including programming produced by Pilgrim Media Group, of which we own a 62.5% interest). 
In fiscal 2017, syndicated programming (through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Debmar-Mercury) and scripted and unscripted

Television Production- International
We continue to expand our television business internationally through sales and distribution of original Lionsgate television series, Starz original programming that is or may be produced by Lionsgate’s legacy television production group and licensed to Starz, third party television programming and format acquisitions. Indeed, in April 2017, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment for international physical (i.e., packaged media) distribution rights (outside of North America and the British Isles) for our television portfolio (other than digital media).
We also focused on continued global expansion of our television business through various joint ventures and investments. In December 2015, Lionsgate UK acquired a 25% interest in television and film production company Kindle Entertainment, which is currently in post-production on Kiss Me First for Channel 4 and Netflix. In July 2016, Lionsgate UK acquired an interest in non-scripted television production company Primal Media, which is currently in production on Release the Hounds for ITV2 and which has produced and broadcast their primetime ITV show Bigheads on ITV1 on April 23, 2017. In December 2016, Lionsgate UK acquired an interest in television drama company Potboiler Television, and also agreed to fund overhead and development costs in Bonafide Films, in exchange for a first look distribution deal for worldwide rights in future television content. Bonafide Films is a film and television production company formed by Margery Bone and Elwen Rowlands and develops and produces films and television programs for worldwide exploitation. For additional information, see Joint Ventures, Partnerships and Ownership Interests below.

Television Production-Home Entertainment 
For information regarding television production home entertainment revenue, see Motion Pictures - Home Entertainment above.
Television Production- Other
Other revenues are derived from, among other sources, product integration in our television episodes and programs, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from the licensing of our television programs to other ancillary markets. For additional information, see Motion Pictures - Other above. 
MEDIA NETWORKS
Media Networks- Starz Networks 
Starz Networks is a leading provider of premium subscription video programming to U.S. MVPDs, including cable operators (such as Comcast and Charter), satellite television providers (such as DIRECTV and DISH Network), telecommunications companies (such as AT&T and Verizon), online video providers (such as Amazon) and on an OTT basis.
Our Starz Networks’ flagship premium service STARZ had 24.2 million subscribers as of March 31, 2017 (not including subscribers who receive programming free as part of a promotional offer). STARZ offers original series and recently released and library movies without advertisements. Our Starz Networks’ other services, STARZ ENCORE and MOVIEPLEX, offer theatrical and independent library movies as well as original and older television series also without advertisements. Our services include 17 linear networks, on-demand and online viewing platforms, and a stand-alone OTT service. The linear networks air over 1,000 movies per month from premier studio partners, including first-run content from Sony Pictures Entertainment, and have a growing line-up of successful original programming. Our Starz Networks’ services are offered by Distributors to their subscribers either at a fixed monthly price as part of a programming tier or package or on an a la carte basis, or directly to consumers via the STARZ app at www.starz.com or through our retail partners (such as Apple and Google) for a monthly fee. 
The table below depicts our 17 existing linear services, the respective on-demand service, the STARZ app service and highlights some of their key attributes.

Demographics
Our Starz Networks’ services deliver obsessable original series and big hit movies that appeal to a wide range of audiences, attracting both die hard and casual fans and serving a variety of fandoms.  We are focused on developing and delivering content to meet the needs of engaged audiences such as African Americans, women, Latinos and male-skewing genre fans.    
Built to serve both our traditional MVPDs as well as the OTT community, the STARZ app is a best-in-class subscription video app designed with fans in mind. In addition to targeting subscribers via an MVPD offering, the STARZ app pursues new audiences who are looking for an alternative to a traditional subscription model. The primary target for the app consists of a balanced mix of individuals, who are cost-conscious, heavy consumers of video content, tech savvy and likely have at least one OTT subscription service. Other important segments consist of households with children and frequent travelers looking for the ability to download and watch their favorites without an internet connection.  
Affiliation agreements
Our Starz Networks’ services are distributed pursuant to affiliation agreements with Distributors (primarily MVPDs). These agreements require delivery of programming that meets certain standards and volumes of first-run movies or original series or number of first-run output studios. We earn revenue under these agreements either (i) based on the total number of subscribers who receive our services multiplied by rates specified in the affiliation agreements or (ii) based on amounts or rates which are not tied solely to the total number of subscribers who receive our services.
We work with Distributors to increase the number of subscribers to our Starz Networks’ services. To accomplish this, we may help fund the Distributors’ efforts to market these services or may permit Distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. We believe these efforts enhance our relationship with Distributors, improve the awareness of our services and ultimately increase subscribers and revenue over the term of these affiliation agreements.
18

Distributors report the number of subscribers to our services and pay for services, generally, on a monthly basis. The agreements are generally structured to be multi-year agreements with staggered expiration dates and generally provide for annual contractual rate increases of a fixed percentage or a fixed amount, or rate increases tied to annual increases in the Consumer Price Index. 
Our Starz Networks’ affiliation agreements expire at various dates through 2022. Failure to renew important affiliation agreements, or the termination of those agreements, would have a material adverse effect on our Starz Networks’ business, and, even if affiliation agreements are renewed, there can be no assurance that renewal rates will equal or exceed the rates that are currently being charged. Starz Networks has not historically failed to renew an agreement, although agreements have sometimes expired before the renewal was fully negotiated and finalized or were continued on a month-to-month basis (in such cases, paid carriage of our services continued unaffected during the periods in which the agreements were being negotiated). 
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, revenue earned under affiliation agreements with AT&T (including DIRECTV) accounted for at least 10% of Lionsgate's revenue, on a pro forma basis as if the Starz Merger and our segment reorganization occurred on April 1, 2016.
OTT service
The STARZ app, which debuted in April 2016, is the single destination for both Distributor authenticated and direct OTT subscribers to stream or download our Starz Networks’ original series and movie content. The STARZ app:

• | Is available on a wide array of platforms and devices;


• | Includes on-demand streaming and downloadable access to our Starz Networks’ content in a single destination app;


• | Offers instant access to more than 4,500 selections each month (including original series and commercial free movies);


• | Is available for purchase as a standalone OTT service for $8.99/month; and is


• | Available as an additional benefit to paying MVPD subscribers of the Starz Networks’ linear premium services.

Output and Content License Agreements
The majority of content on our Starz Networks’ services consists of movies that have been released theatrically. Starz Networks has an exclusive long-term output licensing agreement with Sony for all qualifying movies released theatrically in the U.S. by studios owned by Sony through December 31, 2021. The Sony agreement, which began in 2001, includes all titles released under the Columbia, Screen Gems, Sony Pictures Classics and TriStar labels. Starz Networks does not license movies produced by Sony Pictures Animation. Under this agreement, Starz Networks has valuable exclusive rights to air new movies on linear television services, on-demand or online during two separate windows over a period of approximately three to seven years from their initial theatrical release. Generally, except on a VOD or pay-per-view basis, no other linear service, online streaming or other video service may air or stream these recent releases during Starz Networks’ windows, and no other premium subscription service may air or stream these releases between the two windows.
Starz Networks’ long-term output licensing agreement with certain studios owned by The Walt Disney Company expired on December 31, 2015. The final movies received from Disney have license periods extending into 2017, with subsequent windows extending beyond then.
Starz Networks also licenses library content comprised of older, previously released theatrical movies from many of Hollywood’s major studios. In addition to theatrical movies, Starz Networks licenses made for television movies, television series and other content from studios, production companies or other rights holders. The rights agreements for library content are of varying duration and generally permit Starz Networks’ services to exhibit these movies, series and other programming during certain window periods.
A summary of Starz Networks’ significant output and library programming agreements (including a library agreement with Lionsgate) are as follows:

The Sony output agreement requires Starz Networks to pay for movies at rates calculated on a pricing grid that is based on each film’s domestic box office performance (subject to maximum amounts payable per movie and a cap on the number of movies that can be put to Starz Networks each year). The amounts Starz Networks pays for library content vary based on each specific agreement, but generally reflect an amount per movie, series or other programming commensurate with the quality (e.g., utility and perceived popularity) of the content being licensed.
Original programming
Starz Networks contracts with independent production companies and our Television Production operating segment to produce original programming that appears on our Starz Networks’ services. These contractual arrangements can provide Starz Networks with:

• | Outright ownership of the programming, in which case we wholly-own the series and receive all distribution and other rights to the content;


• | An exclusive U.S. pay television license and other distribution or ancillary rights covering specific territories for specified periods of time; or


• | An exclusive U.S. pay television license which provides for the programming to appear only on Starz Networks’ services for specified periods of time.

Transmission
We uplink our programming to five non-preemptible, protected transponders on three satellites positioned in geo-synchronous orbit. These satellites feed our signals to various swaths of the Americas. We lease these transponders under long-term lease agreements. These transponder leases have termination dates ranging from 2018 to 2021. We transmit to these satellites from our uplink center in Englewood, Colorado. We have made arrangements at a third party facility to uplink our linear channels to these satellites in the event we are unable to do so from our uplink center.
Regulatory Matters
In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) regulates broadcasters, the providers of satellite communications services and facilities for the transmission of programming services, the cable television systems and other Distributors that distribute such services, and, to some extent, the availability of the programming services themselves through its regulation of program licensing. Cable television systems in the U.S. are also regulated by municipalities or other state and local government authorities. Although cable television systems are subject to federal rate regulation on the provision of basic service, such regulation is limited to those local franchise authorities that have made an affirmative showing that there is no effective competition in the community. Very few franchise authorities have filed the necessary rate regulation certification. Nonetheless, other franchise conditions could place downward pressure on the fees cable television companies are willing or able to pay for programming services, and regulatory carriage requirements also could adversely affect the number of channels available to carry our networks.
Regulation of Carriage of Broadcast Stations
The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (“1992 Cable Act”) granted broadcasters a choice of must carry rights or retransmission consent rights. The rules adopted by the FCC generally provide for mandatory carriage by cable systems of all local full-power commercial television broadcast signals selecting must carry rights and, depending on a cable system’s channel capacity, non-commercial television broadcast signals. Such statutorily mandated carriage of broadcast stations coupled with the provisions of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which require cable television systems with 36 or more “activated” channels to reserve a percentage of such channels for commercial use by unaffiliated third parties and permit franchise authorities to require the cable operator to provide channel capacity, equipment and facilities for public, educational and government access channels, could adversely affect our networks by limiting the carriage of our services in cable systems with limited channel capacity.
Closed Captioning
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 also required the FCC to establish rules to ensure that video programming is fully accessible to the hearing impaired through closed captioning. The rules adopted by the FCC require substantial closed captioning, with only limited exemptions. In 2012, the FCC adopted regulations pursuant to the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 that require, among other things, video programming owners to send caption files for Internet 
21

protocol (“IP”) delivered video programming to video programming distributors and providers along with program files. In 2014, the FCC adopted closed captioning quality standards for captioning accuracy, synchronicity, completeness and placement and captioning best practices for programmers. In 2016, the FCC amended its closed captioning requirements to make programmers jointly responsible with distributors for captioning compliance, and to adopt certain registration, certification and complaint procedures applicable to programmers. As a result of these captioning requirements, our networks may incur additional costs for closed captioning.
Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (“CALM”) Act
Congress enacted the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (“CALM”) Act in 2010. The CALM Act directs the FCC to incorporate into its rules and make mandatory a technical standard that is designed to prevent digital television commercial advertisements from being transmitted at louder volumes than the program material they accompany. The FCC’s CALM Act implementing regulations became effective in 2012. Although the FCC’s CALM Act regulations place the primary compliance responsibility on Distributors, the FCC’s “safe harbor” compliance approach, which requires programmers to issue “widely available” CALM Act compliance certifications to Distributors, effectively shifts much of that responsibility to programmers.
Copyright Regulation
We are required to obtain any necessary music performance rights from the rights holders. These rights generally are controlled by the music performance rights organizations of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) and the Society of European Stage Authors and Composers (SESAC), each with rights to the music of various artists.
Satellites and Uplink
In general, authorization from the FCC must be obtained for the construction and operation of a communications satellite. The FCC authorizes utilization of satellite orbital slots assigned to the U.S. by the World Radiocommunication Conference. Such slots are finite in number, thus limiting the number of carriers that can provide satellite transponders and the number of transponders available for transmission of programming services. At present, however, there are numerous competing satellite service providers that make transponders available for video services. The FCC also regulates the earth stations uplinking to and/or downlinking from such satellites.
Program Access
Because overlapping attributable interests continue to exist between us and entities owning cable systems, we remain subject to the FCC’s program access and antidiscrimination rules. The 1992 Cable Act and implementing regulations generally prohibit a cable operator that has an attributable interest in a satellite programmer from improperly influencing the terms and conditions of sale to unaffiliated Distributors. Further, the 1992 Cable Act requires that such affiliated programmers make their programming services available to cable operators and competing Distributors on terms and conditions that do not unfairly discriminate among Distributors. The FCC’s program licensing rules establish a damages remedy in situations where the defendant knowingly violates the regulations and a timeline for the resolution of complaints, among other things. As part of the FCC’s 2008 order approving the acquisition by Liberty Media Corporation (now known as Liberty Interactive Corporation) (“Liberty Media”) of a controlling interest in DIRECTV, the FCC imposed program access conditions on Liberty Media and its affiliated entities, which remain applicable to Starz. Under this order, as amended by the FCC’s October 5, 2012 order allowing the general restrictions on exclusive contracts to expire, we also are required to make our programming services available to all Distributors on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions. 
In 2014, the FCC released a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on a proposal to revise the definition of distributor in its rules to include services, such as Internet-based services, that make available for purchase by subscribers or customers, multiple linear streams of video programming, regardless of the technology used to distribute the programming. If the FCC were to adopt its proposed definition and determine that the program access rules apply to such distributors, we potentially would be required to negotiate with, and license our programming services to, such distributors and to comply with other related regulatory requirements.
Online Services
To the extent that our programming services are distributed through online based platforms, we must comply with various federal and state laws and regulations applicable to online communications and commerce. Congress and individual states may consider additional legislation addressing online privacy and other issues.
22

Proposed Changes in Regulation

The regulation of programming services, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite providers, broadcast television licensees and online distributed services is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux historically. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.
Starz Networks’ Strategy 
Our Starz Networks’ mission is to be a leading global entertainment brand providing powerful and immersive experiences. To that end, our goal is to provide Distributors and subscribers with high-quality, differentiated premium video services available on multiple viewing platforms. Starz Networks focuses on the following strategic goals:

• | Deliver engaging, brand building, premium original programming. We believe this is the most effective path to building a differentiated STARZ brand, which resonates with our Distributors and subscribers. Targeting underserved audiences (e.g., African American, female, Latino) will continue to be a core pillar of our Starz Networks’ original programming content strategy. We continue to use various mechanisms to prudently and economically produce our Starz Networks’ original programming including wholly-owned, co-produced and licensed original series. As a result, our subscribers will have a regular opportunity to see a new episode of a STARZ original series or a new season of an existing STARZ original series on its flagship STARZ service throughout the year.


• | Create compelling consumer offerings. We intend to ensure that our Starz Networks’ services are available in formats and platforms that meet the needs of our Distributors as well as subscribers. We seek to monetize the digital rights we control for our Starz Networks’ exclusive original series and those under our programming licensing agreements with Hollywood studios by licensing the digital rights to Starz Networks’ services to our traditional distributors and online video providers as well as using these rights for the STARZ app.


• | Expand the STARZ brand and business in new international markets. In addition to STARZ PLAY Arabia (see Joint Ventures, Partnerships and Ownership Interests below), we will continue to look for other opportunities in international markets to enhance our Starz Networks brand and ultimately grow this business. 

We believe that this strategy, combined with a proven management team, positions Starz Networks for continued success. We look forward to making our Starz Networks services “must haves” for subscribers and a meaningful margin driver for our Distributors, thereby driving value for our stockholders.
Media Networks - Content and Other
Content and other revenues for our Media Networks segment are derived from the licensing of Starz original programming to digital media platforms, international television networks, through packaged media and other ancillary markets. For more information regarding such distribution, see Television Production-Home Entertainment, Television Production- International and Television Production-Other above. 
Media Networks - Streaming Services
Streaming services represent the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming service initiatives on SVOD platforms including Comic-Con HQ, Tribeca ShortList and our recently announced Spanish-language premium movie streaming service.

Spanish-Language Premium Movie Service | In 2016, we teamed with Univision Communications Inc., a leading media company serving Hispanic America, and Hemisphere Media Group, a leading U.S. and Latin American owner and operator of Spanish-language pay television and broadcast networks, to launch a premium SVOD movie service designed specifically for the tens of millions of Spanish-speaking and bilingual Hispanic consumers in the U.S. The service will include Spanish-language box office hits spanning the comedy, family, kids, horror and drama genres and current titles from across the Spanish-speaking world, with many available on the same date as their theatrical release in Latin American markets. It will also encompass titles from Pantelion Films, Hollywood films from our 16,000-title library and other catalogs dubbed into Spanish, and Hemisphere’s movie library, which encompasses one of the largest selections of contemporary Spanish-language blockbusters and critically-acclaimed titles from Mexico, Latin America, Spain and the Caribbean. The venture will capitalize on the marketing and distribution expertise of Univision, which will offer the service to cable and satellite operators individually as well as in tandem with its own Univision NOW, a subscription service for its broadcast networks Univision and UniMas. Univision will also license titles from its classic Latino cinema library to the service. 

JOINT VENTURES, PARTNERSHIPS AND OWNERSHIP INTERESTS
Our joint ventures, partnerships and ownership interests support our strategy of diversifying our company as a multiplatform global industry leader in entertainment. We regularly evaluate our existing properties, libraries and other assets and businesses in order to determine whether they continue to enhance our competitive position in the industry, have the potential to generate significant long-term returns, represent an optimal use of our capital and are aligned with our goals. When appropriate, we discuss potential strategic transactions with third parties for purchase of our properties, libraries or other assets or businesses that factor into these evaluations. As a result, we may, from time to time, determine to sell individual properties, libraries or other assets or businesses or enter into additional joint ventures, strategic transactions and similar arrangements for individual properties, libraries or other assets or businesses.

Pantelion Films. In September 2010, we launched Pantelion Films, a joint venture with Videocine, an affiliate of Televisa, which produces, acquires and distributes a slate of English and Spanish language feature films that target Hispanic moviegoers in the U.S. Pantelion Films, the first major Latino Hollywood studio and the face of Hispanic entertainment, provides Hispanic moviegoers with a steady source of exciting and original films, featuring world-class Latino actors, directors and writers. From comedies and dramas to family movies and romantic comedies, Pantelion Films produces and acquires movies that speak directly to acculturated and Spanish-dominant Hispanics alike. Pantelion Films’ fiscal 2017 theatrical slate included the following films: No Manches Frida, a Spanish language remake based on the German blockbuster film Fack Ju Göhte (and the highest grossing Spanish language film of 2016 in the U.S., and fourth highest grossing Mexican film of all time); Compadres, Un Padre No Tan Padre, Everybody Loves Somebody and the fourth installment of the animated Leyendas franchise, La Leyenda del Chupacabras.

Intellectual Property
We currently use and own or license a number of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and similar intellectual property in connection with our businesses and own registrations and applications to register them both domestically and internationally. We believe that ownership of, and/or the right to use, such trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and similar intellectual property is an important factor in our businesses and that our success does depends, in part, on such ownership.
Motion picture and television piracy is extensive in many parts of the world, including South America, Asia and certain Eastern European countries, and is made easier by technological advances and the conversion of content into digital formats. This trend facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of content on packaged media and through digital formats. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of these products has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business, because these products reduce the revenue we receive from our products. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.
Competition
Our motion picture production and distribution, television programming and syndication and premium pay television networks businesses (as well as home entertainment, global distribution and sales, interactive ventures and games and location-based entertainment business) operate in highly competitive markets. We compete with companies within the entertainment and media business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation and other cultural related activities. We compete with the major studios, numerous independent motion picture and television production companies, television networks, pay television services and digital media platforms for the acquisition of literary and film properties, the services of performing artists, directors, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our entertainment businesses. In addition, our motion pictures compete for audience acceptance and exhibition outlets with motion pictures produced and distributed by other companies. Likewise, our television product faces significant competition from independent distributors as well as major studios. Moreover, our networks compete with other programming networks for viewing and subscribership by each distributor’s customer base. As a result, the success of any of our motion picture, television or networks business is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular film or program, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing content released into the marketplace at or near the same time as well as on the ability to license and produce content for the networks that is adequate in quantity and quality and will generate satisfactory subscriber levels.
Given such competition, we attempt to operate with a different business model than others. We typically emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. Our cost structures are designed to utilize our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative entertainment content to serve diverse audiences worldwide.
Social Responsibility
We are committed to acting responsibly and making a positive difference in the local and global community through Lionshares, the umbrella for our companywide commitment to our communities. Lionshares is a volunteer program that seeks to provide opportunities for employees within the Lionsgate family to partner with a diverse range of charitable organizations.
