 Item 1. Business 
 Destination XL Group, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”), is the largest specialty retailer of big & tall men’s clothing and shoes with retail locations in the United States and Toronto, Canada. We operate under the trade names of Destination XL®, DXL®, DXL Men’s Apparel, DXL outlets, Casual Male XL® and Casual Male XL outlets. At January 30, 2021, we operated 226 DXL retail stores, 17 DXL outlet stores, 46 Casual Male XL retail stores, 22 Casual Male XL outlet stores and a digital business, including an e-commerce site at dxl.com and a mobile site m.destinationXL.com. In fiscal 2018, we launched a wholesale business unit focused on product development and distribution relationships with key retailers offering co-branded men’s big & tall apparel lines.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us” and “the Company” refer to Destination XL Group, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 as “fiscal 2020,” “fiscal 2019” and “fiscal 2018,” respectively.
OUR INDUSTRY 
 We define the big & tall men’s clothing market as starting at a waist size of 38” and greater, as well as tops sized 1XL and greater. Growth in this segment historically has been driven by rapidly changing market demographics. We believe that we can increase our market share by catering to the broader target market, attracting customers from various income, age and lifestyle segments and offering the widest selection of sizes and styles that fit well. We believe opportunity continues to exist for market share growth from the lower-size range of our market, that is, men with a 38” to 43” waist size, which are usually the size range for most men’s apparel retailers that are not core to their mix. In addition to these lower sizes, opportunity for further growth also exists with men with a 54” or greater waist size.  
HISTORY 
 Our Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1976 under the name Designs, Inc. Until fiscal 1995, we operated exclusively in Levi Strauss & Co. branded apparel mall and outlet stores. In May 2002, we acquired the Casual Male business from Casual Male Corp. at a bankruptcy court-ordered auction. At the time of the acquisition, Casual Male was the largest specialty retailer of men’s clothing in the big & tall market in the United States. As a result of the acquisition, on August 8, 2002, we changed our name

to “Casual Male Retail Group, Inc.” In fiscal 2004, we acquired the Rochester Clothing stores.  Through fiscal 2010, we catered to customers through our three store formats, from our value-oriented customer (Casual Male XL outlets) to our luxury-oriented customer (Rochester Clothing stores)
 In fiscal 2010, we launched a new store concept, Destination XL (“DXL”). The DXL store concept offers our customers an extensive assortment of products, ranging from value-oriented to luxury-oriented with an increased presence of name brands, without having to shop multiple stores. In addition to offering our customers a wide assortment, we also wanted to provide them with a unique shopping experience. We are focused on providing outstanding customer service through our DXL stores, with larger fitting rooms and professional, trained associates providing personal attention. With the initial success of this store format, we made a similar change to our e-commerce business in fiscal 2011 when we launched our DestinationXL.com website (now dxl.com). In fiscal 2019, we closed our five remaining Rochester Clothing stores. 
 OUR BUSINESS
 We operate as an omni-channel retailer of big & tall men’s clothing and shoes.  Through our multiple brands, which include both branded apparel and private-label, we provide a premium, personalized shopping experience, whether in-store or digitally, with a broad range of merchandise at varying price points, catering from the value-oriented customer to the luxury customer. Our objective is to appeal to all of our customers by providing a good, better, best array of product assortments in all primary lifestyles with multiple and convenient ways to shop. 
 Our DXL retail stores, e-commerce site, dxl.com, and mobile app cater to all income demographics and offer our customers merchandise to fit a variety of lifestyles from casual to business, young to mature, in all price ranges and in all large sizes from XL and up. In addition, a complete offering of shoes in sizes 10W to 18W is available at dxl.com.  Our Casual Male XL retail stores primarily carry moderate-priced branded and private-label casual sportswear and dresswear. We also operate Casual Male XL outlets and DXL outlets for our value-oriented customer. Through digital marketplaces, we are able to extend our reach, by providing a select offering of our merchandise to new customers who may not be current DXL customers.  In addition to our retail channels, we also launched a wholesale channel in fiscal 2018. 
 What is unique about our business is our ability to manage the number of sizes offered to our customers to ensure proper fit and optimizing our in-stock position throughout each season. Our best-selling pant has 43 size combinations and a unique specification as compared to an average retailer who may only have 15 different size combinations.  We maintain a consolidated inventory across all channels that enables us to manage our in-stock position of all sizes effectively, ultimately improving customer service. Moreover, our planning and allocation methodologies, with respect to store assortment planning, help to optimize each location’s market potential without excessive inventory levels. 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 We expect that there will be a gradual recovery in demand for men’s apparel during fiscal 2021, as vaccines are more widely administered by late Spring 2021 and the country begins to socialize again.  In response to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we took decisive steps to pivot our business model early in fiscal 2020.  Our efforts during fiscal 2020 were focused on withstanding the decline in sales and preserving liquidity, positioning ourselves to emerge from the pandemic with significantly more operating leverage. As a result of the steps taken in fiscal 2020, we believe we are well-positioned to recover in fiscal 2021.  
 In fiscal 2021, our key initiatives include the following:
  
• | Digital growth. In fiscal 2021, we want to build off the significant growth that we experienced in fiscal 2020. We have a number of initiatives planned to further enhance the digital experience for our customers by leveraging new technologies to create a frictionless experience across all of our digital platforms. Despite our expectation that our customer will return to stores, we expect the digital shift will endure. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Marketing initiatives. We have executed a marketing strategy that is responsive to changes in customer shopping habits and behaviors through CRM segmentation, unique personas and personalization of digital interaction such as one-to-one marketing email messaging. During fiscal 2020, while our omni-channel customer continued to shop online, our in-store customers stopped shopping amidst the pandemic. Our focus in fiscal 2021 will be to reengage with our in-store customers, especially those higher-spending customers who have not shopped with us recently. We expect to spend our marketing dollars on our digital programs, with less emphasis on TV and radio, as we continue to develop a more personalized one-on-one connection with our customers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Merchandising initiatives. Prior to fiscal 2020 and the pandemic, we had already started to decrease our in-store presentation of tailored merchandise, in response to the “casualization of America.” With the pandemic and many men working from home, we saw a continued shift toward our more casual categories. We expect this shift to continue in fiscal 2021 and our 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

strategy for Spring 2021 will be focused on aligning with the new work-from-home and casual wear lifestyle. Speed to market initiatives, such as the implementation of VMI (“vendor managed inventory”) and factories holding greige fabrication in key items have given us greater ability to react and drive business as well as create flexibility in our inventory. We will continue to narrow our assortment, reducing the number of brands we carry and focusing instead on the development of the assortments. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rightsizing our store portfolio. We made substantial progress during fiscal 2020 in working with our landlord community to renegotiate lease agreements. Our project included two phases, with the first phase specifically working with landlords for the period of time when our stores were closed due to the pandemic, which resulted in a number of rent abatements and deferments. The second phase, which is ongoing and will continue into fiscal 2021, is working with our landlords with a long-term perspective. Our guidance for fiscal 2021 assumes that our sales for fiscal 2021 will be 10.8% to 14.8% below fiscal 2019 levels. As a result, we are working with our landlords to realign our occupancy costs given the expected sales. Furthermore, we have approximately 131 stores that have leases with either a natural lease expiration or a kick-out option within the next two years, which provides us with flexibility in these ongoing negotiations. Our goal is to right-size our store portfolio, through lease negotiations or lease-term expirations, to optimize store profitability and omni-channel distribution. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Managing liquidity and debt. We took significant steps in fiscal 2020 to preserve our liquidity during the pandemic. As we head into fiscal 2021, we are continuing to monitor and enhance our liquidity and will use free cash flow to retire debt. We have reduced our cost structure, which we intend to maintain as revenues increase. We are not planning to open any new stores or rebrand any of our existing Casual Male XL stores in fiscal 2021, and are instead limiting our capital expenditures to only those necessary to meet our current business objectives. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020, we raised $5 million, before offering costs, in connection with the sale of 11.1 million shares of our common stock, as part of a registered direct offering. Also in March 2021, we entered into a new $17.5 million FILO (“first-in, last-out”) loan, the proceeds of which were used to pay-off our existing $15.0 million FILO. Our advance rates under the existing FILO were set to amortize down to 5.0% in May 2021. Our new FILO has an advance rate of 15.0% and will provide us with additional borrowing capacity of $5.0 to $10.0 million in fiscal 2021. Both the raised capital and the new term loan provide additional flexibility to liquidity.

MERCHANDISE 
 We offer our customers a broad assortment of apparel that is appropriate to our diverse customer base. Regardless of our customers’ age, socioeconomic status, or lifestyle preference, we are able to assemble a wardrobe to fit their apparel needs. We offer such assortments in both private-label product and a wide array of brand name labels. With over 5,000 styles available, we carry tops in sizes up to 8XL and 8XLT, bottoms with waist sizes 38” to 70”, and shoes in sizes 10W to 18W. Big and tall is all we do. We do not just scale up product from a regular fit like most other retailers; our fit is built from unique specifications for every size and style.
 Our stores are merchandised to showcase entire outfits by lifestyle, including traditional, active, modern and denim. This format allows us to merchandise key items and seasonal goods in prominent displays and makes coordinating outfits easier for the customer while encouraging multi-item purchases. This lifestyle layout also allows us to manage store space and product assortment effectively in each market to target local demographics. The key item strategy is also fully integrated by lifestyle, allowing us to focus on merchandise presentation and offer our customers a compelling value proposition. 
 Merchandise assortments in our DXL stores are organized not only by lifestyle, but within each lifestyle, the assortments are shown in a “good,” “better” and “best” visual presentation.  With the “best” merchandise assortments featured most prominently in the DXL store, our customers are able to visualize current fashion trends and select their wardrobes within their desired price points in a convenient manner. Our website and select DXL stores also offer certain “luxury” brands. 
 We carry over 100 well-known national brands (“branded apparel”) as well as a number of our own private-label lines within our “good,” “better” and “best” price points.  The penetration of branded apparel in a specific DXL stores can range from 39% to 80%, depending on several factors, but on average, approximately half of the assortment is branded apparel.  
 Higher-End Fashion Apparel -“Best” Merchandise 
 Within this higher-end price range, we carry a broad selection of quality apparel from well-known branded manufacturers, such as, Brooks Brothers®,  The North Face®, Psycho Bunny®, Polo Ralph Lauren®, Jack Victor®, Lucky, Michael Kors®, JOE’S® Jeans, Robert Graham®, 7 for all Mankind®, Tallia® and Robert Barakett ®.

Moderate-Priced Apparel -“Better” Merchandise 
 We offer our customer an extensive selection of quality sportswear and dress clothing at moderate prices carrying well-known brands such as: O’Neill®, Cutter & Buck®, Levis®, Nautica® and Nautica Jeans®, Adidas® Golf, Columbia, Berne®, Carhartt®, Callaway®, Jockey®, Lacoste®, Majestic, Tommy Bahama® and vineyard vines®. 
 Value-Priced Apparel -“Good” Merchandise 
 For our value-oriented customers, we carry Cubavera, Dockers, Lee, Wrangler and Reebok. In addition, we carry several value-priced private label lines: 
  
• | Harbor Bay® was our first proprietary brand and it is a traditional line that continues to represent a significant portion of our business, specifically in terms of our core basic merchandise.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gold Series™ is our core performance offering of tailored-related separates, blazers, dress slacks, dress shirts and neckwear that blends comfort features such as stretch, stain resistance and wrinkle-free fabrics with basic wardrobe essentials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Synrgy™ targets the customer looking for a contemporary/modern look.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oak Hill® is a premier line catering to those customers looking for slightly more style and quality than our Harbor Bay line but still in a traditional lifestyle.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | True Nation® is a denim-inspired line consisting of vintage-screen t-shirts and wovens and is geared towards our younger customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shoes
 Our DXL website offers a full assortment of footwear, with a broad selection from casual to formal, in varying price points. We currently have a selection of more than 600 styles of shoes, ranging in sizes from 10W to 18W, including designer brands such as Cole Haan®, Allen Edmonds®, Timberland®, Calvin Klein® and Lacoste®.
STORE CHANNEL 
 DXL Men’s Apparel Stores 
 At January 30, 2021, we operated 226 DXL retail stores.  Our DXL store concept brings all of our brands together in one format. Within this format, we cater to our diverse customer base, with merchandise representing all price points, from our higher-end brands to value-oriented brands, and all lifestyles, from business to denim.  The size of our DXL stores averages 7,600 square feet, but since fiscal 2016 we have opened smaller (5,000-6,500 square feet) DXL stores.  Because of the smaller size of these stores, they carry a smaller product offering than our other DXL stores but are representative of the “good, better, best” merchandise variety. Our DXL stores are located on real estate that is highly visible, often adjacent to high-performing regional malls or other high-traffic shopping areas.
 Our DXL stores offer up to three times the product offering of a Casual Male XL store. Depending on the customers in each respective market, we can adjust the appropriate mix of merchandise, with varying selections from each of our price points, to cater to each demographic market. 
 Over the past few years, we have rebranded select Casual Male XL retail and outlet stores to the DXL retail and outlet store concept. In many markets, rebranding a Casual Male XL store to a DXL store provides a viable alternative to the more costly endeavor of relocating a Casual Male XL store to new DXL real estate. In addition, the converted stores benefit from DXL advertising.  While our intention is to rebrand more of the remaining Casual Male XL retail and outlet stores to DXL, given the COVID-19 pandemic we did not rebrand any stores in fiscal 2020 and have no plans to do so in fiscal 2021.  
 Casual Male XL Retail Stores 
 At January 30, 2021, we operated 46 Casual Male XL full-price retail stores, located primarily in strip centers or stand-alone locations. The majority of the merchandise carried in our Casual Male XL stores is moderate-priced basic or fashion-neutral items, such as jeans, casual slacks, t-shirts, polo shirts, dress shirts and suit separates. These stores also carry a full complement of our “better” private label collections. The average Casual Male XL retail store is approximately 3,300 square feet. 
DXL Outlet /Casual Male XL Outlet Stores
 At January 30, 2021, we operated 17 DXL outlet stores and 22 Casual Male XL outlet stores designed to offer a wide range of casual clothing for the big & tall customer at prices that are generally 20-25% lower than our moderate-priced merchandise. Much of the 
 
6


merchandise in our outlet stores is offered at discounted prices to cater to the value-oriented customer. In addition to private-label and branded merchandise at our “good” price tier, our outlets also carry clearance product obtained from DXL and Casual Male XL stores, offering the outlet customer the ability to purchase branded and fashion product for a reduced price. 
 The average DXL outlet is approximately 4,800 square feet and the average Casual Male XL outlet store is approximately 3,000 square feet.   
 DIRECT CHANNEL
 Our direct business is a critical channel for growing sales and market share through new customer acquisition. Our direct business grew 14.7% in fiscal 2020 and represented approximately 40.4% of our total retail sales, as compared to 23.1% of our retail segment sales in fiscal 2019.  This accelerated growth in our direct business in fiscal 2020 was principally driven by our DXL.com website and app, due to our customers shifting to online shopping during the pandemic.  
 We define our direct business as sales that originate online, whether through our website, our app, those initiated online at the store level, our Guest Engagement Center, or through a third-party marketplace. We want to serve our customers wherever and how they want to shop, whether in-person at a store, over the telephone, or online via a computer, smartphone or tablet. 
 We have the ability to showcase all of our store inventories online, resulting in additional transactions that are initiated online, but are ultimately completed in store.  In addition, our stores are able to fulfill an order for an item that is out-of-stock in our warehouse.  This capability has not only resulted in incremental sales, but it has also helped us reduce clearance merchandise at the store level and manage margins.
 DXL Website and App
 Our DXL website and app were instrumental to our ability to service our customers during fiscal 2020.  In March 2020, when we temporarily closed all of our store locations, our warehouse remained open and we were able to continue making sales through our DXL website.  Even after our stores began to reopen, because of the ongoing concerns of the pandemic, consumers continued to shift to online shopping helping drive higher new customer acquisition for the website business.  The growth of our website had been a key initiative for us prior to the pandemic and with the recent upgrades and enhancements that we made in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, our DXL website was prepared to handle this accelerated growth in fiscal 2020.  Sales from our BOPIS (buy online, pickup in store) and BOPAC (buy online, pickup at curb) programs substantially increased over the prior year, especially during the fourth quarter when the programs were up over 400% to last year. 
 Digital Sales at Store Level
 In support of our omni-channel approach, our store associates use our website to help fulfill our in-store customers’ clothing needs. If a wider selection of a lifestyle, color or size of an item is not available in our store, then our store associates can order the item for our customer online through our direct channel and have it shipped to the store or directly to the customer. Our customers also have the ability to shop-by-store and pick-up in store on the same day.  As expected, because of the pandemic and the decrease of in-person visits to our stores in fiscal 2020, we saw a significant decrease in online sales that originated at the store-level.
Digital Marketplaces
 We continue to broaden our reach through digital, third-party marketplaces, which is another growth initiative for our direct business. A large portion of our assortment is available on Amazon, with Amazon Prime shipping.  Digital marketplaces provide us an opportunity to grow our customer base and introduce new customers to our brand. 
WHOLESALE CHANNEL 
 Our wholesale business focuses on the product development, manufacturing and distribution of big and tall product. This strategic growth initiative allows us to leverage our existing infrastructure, including DXL’s expertise in technical design and global sourcing. We believe the wholesale channel is a strong complement to our retail channel allowing us to broaden our presence in the marketplace and provides us an opportunity to access new customers who do not currently shop at DXL. 
MERCHANDISE PLANNING AND ALLOCATION  
 Our merchandise planning and allocation function is critical to the effective management of our inventory, store assortments, product sizes and overall gross margin profitability. The merchandise planning and allocation team has an array of planning and replenishment tools available to assist in maintaining an appropriate level of inventory, in-stock positions at the stores and for the direct channel, and 
 
7


pre-season planning for product assortments for each store and the direct channel. Additionally, in-season reporting identifies opportunities and challenges in inventory performance. Over the past several years, we have made, and we will continue to make, investments in implementing best practice tools and processes for our merchandise planning and allocation. 
 Our core merchandise makes up approximately 38.5% of our merchandise assortment. Our planning and allocation team estimates quantity and demand several months in advance to optimize gross margin and minimize end-of-season merchandise for all seasonal merchandise. We develop customized assortment strategies by store that accentuate lifestyle preferences for each particular store. 
 Our merchandising data warehouse provides the merchandising team with standardized reporting for monitoring assortment performance by product category and by store, identifying in-stock positions by size and generally monitoring overall inventory levels relative to selling. At season end, we analyze the overall performance of product categories, overall assortments and specific styles by store to focus on the opportunities and challenges for the next season’s planning cycle. 
 Utilizing a set of specific universal reporting tools, the merchandise planning and allocation team is able to fulfill their daily, weekly and monthly roles and responsibilities. These reporting tools provide focused and actionable views of the business to optimize the overall assortment by category and by store. We are confident that our inventory performance will be optimized by having all members of the merchandise planning and allocation team follow a standardized set of processes with the use of standardized reporting tools. 
 STORE OPERATIONS
We believe that our store associates are the key to creating the highest quality experience for our customers. The culture in our stores is to be guest centric in an effort to engage and build a relationship with our guests. Our overall goal is to assist our associates in becoming less task-oriented and more attentive to the customers’ apparel needs.  By establishing this relationship, associates are able to expand our customers’ wardrobe, not only making the customer look good, but also helping them feel confident in their apparel choices.  Our associates are trained to be wardrobe experts, capable of accommodating our customers’ style and fit needs with ready-to-wear clothing. Our associates are well versed in not only the product selection carried in their specific store, but also the product selection carried online.  With a point-of-sale system that can access items online for the customer who is physically in the store, our associates are able to fulfill all of their customers’ needs. 
 Our multi-unit, field management team receives extensive training on recruiting associates who are the correct fit for our stores. Our new DXL store management team hires are trained extensively through senior peer trainers throughout the country.  The culture has been created over the last ten years to promote when possible from our internal associates, starting at the Assistant Store Manager level up to, and including, members of our Regional Sales Management Team.  Our Regional Vice Presidents give us touch-points in the field in addition to the Regional Sales Managers and the store management to ensure consistency in executing our standards and all programs and processes we deem important to our success.
 Each new member of the store management team spends time in a DXL store, working with training managers and their Regional Sales manager to solidify his or her training before being released to the respective “home” store.  We are able to gauge the effectiveness of our training through measuring sales productivity at each level of the field organization, including individual sales associates. We believe our training system, together with monitoring sales metrics to help identify opportunities for further training, will improve sales productivity and strengthen our customer’s brand loyalty. 
 Each store is staffed with a store manager, assistant manager and key holders. The store manager is responsible for achieving certain sales and operational targets. Our stores have an incentive-based commission plan for managers and selling staff to encourage associates to focus on our customer’s wardrobing needs and sales productivity.  Our field organization strives to promote from within a culture that has been building for ten years, with approximately 75% of the field organization’s multi-unit managers having managed one of our retail stores. 
 Our field organization is overseen by our Senior Vice President of Store Sales and Operations, Regional Vice Presidents, Regional Sales Managers, and a Store Operations Team, who provide management development and guidance to individual store managers. Each Regional Sales Manager is responsible for hiring and developing store managers at the stores assigned to that Regional Sales Manager’s market, and for the overall operations and profitability of those stores. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our store operations during fiscal 2020.  For the safety of our associates and customers, all of our stores were closed on March 17, 2020 with stores gradually reopening beginning at the end of April 2020.  By the end of June 2020, all stores had reopened but with significantly reduced operating hours, which continued through the end of fiscal 2020.  During fiscal 2020, we implemented many safety protocols in our stores so that our customers, who choose to shop in-person, feel safe.  The majority of our stores offer the option for no-contact, curbside pickup, through our BOPAC and BOPIS programs.  For 
 
8


the safety of our field organization, we also equipped the stores with iPads to enable our Regional Sales Managers and members of our senior leadership team the ability to engage with stores on a more frequent basis without the risk of travel.
MARKETING AND ADVERTISING 
 We believe that our marketing initiatives are key to driving our sales growth by increasing traffic to our stores, website and app. We are continuing to shift our marketing strategy away from our broad-based shotgun advertising to a more targeted, personalized, data-driven model where we can segment and ultimately engage differently with each of our customers based on their shopping behaviors across all our buying channels. While our focus remains digitally driven, given the impact of the pandemic on our stores, our priority heading into fiscal 2021 is driving store traffic and re-engaging with our top, primarily in-store, customers.  While our omni-channel shoppers shopped online during fiscal 2020, a segment of our top customers tend to shop primarily in-store who, given the pandemic and health concerns, did not shop to the levels they have historically. We plan to target and personalize experiences for these top customers with addressable media to re-engage and bring them back.  
 As we head into fiscal 2021, we plan to increase our digital and CRM marketing investments, with a lesser investment in television/radio.  We continue to take an increasingly stringent analytical perspective to our marketing program, focusing on understanding incremental outcomes in addition to the “return on ad spend” throughout all of our programs.  This data-driven philosophy extends across all of our marketing initiatives as we look at new ways to engage our customers.  Our on-going work on enhancing our customer segmentation will ultimately drive our long-term marketing strategy, enabling us to create targeted and personalized content and messaging to our various customer segments.  
 Our marketing program includes email, direct mail, loyalty program, direct marketing, digital marketing, social media, television, and radio, among others.  Our marketing costs in fiscal 2021 will be heavily focused on our direct marketing initiatives, such as digital advertising, direct mail and loyalty incentives. 
 GLOBAL SOURCING 
 We have built a strong internal team with more than 40 years of combined experience that is responsible for managing an international network of vendors and suppliers across the globe. We manufacture a significant percentage of our private-label merchandise primarily in Southeast Asian countries consisting of Vietnam, Bangladesh, Cambodia and India. We continue to reduce dependency on China, inclusive of our raw materials and trims.  We are a member of Sedex Global, a leading ethical trade service provider, to increase our social, environmental and ethical sustainability and participate in their Ethical Trade Audit platform.  Through collaboration with our third-party inspection vendor, we have developed a “5-Pillar Audit” to include traceability of both raw materials and the equipment used to produce finished goods. We are responsive to the US Customs Border Protection (“CBP”) Withhold Release Order on Products Made in Xinjiang region of China on January 13, 2021.  We have also developed a Compliance Certificate of Traceability. This will be included with all shipments and presented to the CBP with the goods upon arrival to US Customs. We have diversified our global network outside of China and have moved certain programs into additional countries with duty-free opportunities such as Jordan, Guatemala and Mexico. We have strong-established relationships with many of the leading factories and mills across the globe. Our sourcing network consists of over 28 factories in eight countries who are experts in big & tall sizing and production. In fiscal 2020, approximately 50% of all our product needs were sourced directly. 
 Our global sourcing strategy is a balanced approach, which considers quality, cost and lead-time, depending on the requirements of the program. We believe our current sourcing structure meets our operating requirements and provide capacity for growth. The growth and effectiveness of our global direct sourcing program is a key component to the strength of merchandise margins. 
 In an effort to minimize foreign currency risk, all payments to our direct sourced vendors and buying agents are made in U.S. dollars with payment on account. 
 DISTRIBUTION 
 All of our retail distribution operations are centralized at our headquarters located in Canton, Massachusetts. We believe that having a centralized distribution facility maximizes the selling space and in-stock position of our stores and reduces the necessary levels of back-room stock. In addition, the distribution center provides order fulfillment services for our e-commerce business. In-bound calls for our e-commerce business are received at our Canton facility and are primarily fulfilled by our distribution center.  If an order cannot be fulfilled by our distribution center, the order is completed at the store level.  For our wholesale business, we currently utilize two coastal third-party cross-dock facilities.
 Our supply chain technology provides visibility for imports and domestic deliveries giving our buyers accurate shipping information and allowing the distribution center to plan staffing for arriving freight, resulting in reduced costs and improved receipt efficiency.

In fiscal 2019, we upgraded and enhanced our warehousing application for our distribution center systems, which included a new labor management system.  Our warehousing application enables us to streamline our distribution processes, enhance our in-transit times, and reduce our distribution costs. We will continually work to make improvements and upgrades to our software. 
 Since 2003, we have utilized United Parcel Services (“UPS”) for all of our store shipments as well as our domestic customer deliveries. By utilizing UPS, we are able to track all deliveries from the warehouse to our individual stores, including the status of in-transit shipments. In addition, we are able to provide our direct customers with Authorized Return Service and Web labels, making returns more convenient for them.  In October 2019, we renewed our contract with UPS through October 2022. 
 In order to service our International customers, we have contracted with a global e-commerce company for payment and shipment services.  Through this service, international customers view and pay for products in their local currency.  Our vendor then ships directly to our customer, which we believe helps avoid potential fraud and currency exchange rate risks.

 The infrastructure of our management information systems is a priority to us. We believe that the investments we have made in this regard have improved our overall efficiency and improved our access to information enabling timely, data-driven decisions. 
 Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail merchandising and financial systems, which include merchandise planning and reporting, distribution center processing, inventory allocation, sales reporting, and financial processing and reporting. We believe that our current infrastructure provides us the ability and capacity to process transactions more efficiently and provides our management team with comprehensive tools with which to manage our business. 
 Using a retail business intelligence solution, we are able to integrate data from several sources and provide enterprise-wide analytics reporting. Over the past few years, we have continued to develop a custom Assortment Suite application that leverages business intelligence and predictive analytics to provide high impact insights into core merchandising tasks. In an effort to improve our inventory management, we have created a standardized set of “best practices” for both our merchandise planning and allocation groups. 
 Our direct and retail channels maintain a shared inventory system and we operate a single-system platform for our DXL and Casual Male XL stores to deliver improved efficiencies. 
 During fiscal 2020, we upgraded our order management system enabling omni-channel fulfillment, customer engagement and precision tools for inventory visibility and availability across the Company. We also upgraded our CRM environment providing centralized customer data and an integrated suite of advanced tools that create and maintain personalized customer relationships.
 During fiscal 2021, we plan to upgrade our Assortment Suite application to leverage business intelligence and predictive analytics to provide high impact insights into core merchandising tasks.
 We continually work to improve our web environment and the security of our systems. Our mobile and tablet optimized sites capitalize on the growing use of mobile devices to look up store information, review product offerings, and complete purchases. In addition, our current website is fully integrated with a global e-commerce company to accommodate international customers by providing multi-currency pricing, payment processing, and international shipping.
 COMPETITION 
 Our business faces competition from a variety of sources, including department stores, mass merchandisers, other specialty stores and discount and off-price retailers that sell big & tall men’s clothing. While we have successfully competed on the basis of merchandise selection, comfort and fit, customer service and desirable store locations, there can be no assurances that other retailers, including e-commerce retailers, will not adopt purchasing and marketing concepts similar to ours.  Discount retailers with significant buying power, such as Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney, represent a source of competition for us. The direct business has many competitors, including the King Size catalog and website as well as online marketplaces, such as Amazon. 
 The United States big & tall men’s clothing market is highly competitive with many national and regional department stores, specialty apparel retailers, single market operators and discount stores offering a broad range of apparel products similar to ours, the similarity being that the clothes they sell are intended for big and tall men. Besides retail competitors, we consider any casual apparel manufacturer operating in outlet malls throughout the United States to be a competitor in the casual apparel market. We believe that we are the only national operator of men’s apparel stores focused exclusively on the men’s big & tall market.

SEASONALITY 
 Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations as it relates to our operating income, net income, and free cash flow. Traditionally, a significant portion of our operating income, net income, and free cash flow is generated in the fourth quarter, because of the holiday season.  Our inventory is typically at peak levels by the end of the third quarter, which represents a significant use of cash, which is then relieved in the fourth quarter as we sell-down our inventory through the holiday shopping season. 
TRADEMARKS/TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENTS 
 We own several service marks and trademarks relating to our businesses, including, among others, “Destination XL®”, “DXL®”, “DXL Mens Apparel®”, “Big on Being Better®”, “Casual Male®”, “Casual Male XL®”, “Harbor Bay®”, “Oak Hill®”, “Continuous Comfort®”, “Synrgy™”, “Society of One®” and “True Nation®”. We also hold a U.S. patent for an extendable collar system, which is marketed as “Neck-Relaxer®” and a U.S. copyright for a no-iron hang tag. 
 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 Our associates are our greatest asset and we are committed to providing them a safe and healthy work environment. We are committed to inclusivity, acceptance, and equality. Since 2017, we have had a diversity and inclusion initiative called “Normalizing the Brand.” The program brings awareness to unconscious bias and focuses on ensuring the composition of our organization looks and feels like the world we live in and serve. In 2020, we launched a Normalizing the Brand Committee with a primary focus on encouraging managers and associates to have open and honest conversations regarding diversity and inclusion. We have policies and training in place with respect to anti-discrimination and anti-harassment, among others, and provide our associates with access to an anonymous hot-line for reporting any concerns.
 Each associate is required to sign a set of policies that include, among other policies, the code of ethics, anti-harassment and procedures for raising a complaint.  Our policies also contain protection of human rights and prohibit, among other things, the use of child labor or forced, bonded or indentured labor. 
 An Advisory Council, personally headed up by the CEO, was created in 2020 to give cross-functional associates an opportunity to provide input on issues affecting the company’s workforce and the employer-associate relationship.  The purpose of the Council is to facilitate networking, exchange ideas, and suggest ways to enhance staff satisfaction and work effectiveness.
 Perhaps most importantly, we promote professional and career development and mentorship programs.  In 2014, our Associate Engagement & Development Committee implemented the DXLG Mentor Program, which pairs up to 20 mentees with mentors for one-year periods. In April 2016, the DXL Women’s Leadership Group was formed with a mission of “Women supporting, educating and empowering each other @ DXLG”. It started as a pilot program and quickly expanded to now include over 40 female leaders, both people and process managers, in the corporate office and field.  In addition, for the past three years, we have presented Leadercast, a platform for leadership development content (held annually in May) and Leadercast Women (held annually in October) as a host site at our corporate headquarters.
 Our benefits are designed to help employees and their families stay healthy and help them balance their work and personal lives. These benefits include health and wellness, paid time off, employee assistance, competitive pay, career growth opportunities, paid volunteer time, product discounts, and a culture of recognition. The challenges created by the global pandemic brought mental health awareness to the forefront.  We began a pilot program with CALM, an app that provides our home office associates an opportunity to incorporate meditation and other mindfulness activities into their daily routines. 
 As of January 30, 2021, we had 1,316 employees. We hire additional temporary employees during the peak Fall and Holiday seasons. None of our employees is represented by any collective bargaining agreement.
