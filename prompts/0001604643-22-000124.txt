Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. is a holding company and does not conduct any business operations of its own. The company was incorporated on October 7, 2013. On November 6, 2017, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”).
Through our operating subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as “the Company,” “Evoqua,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), Evoqua provides a wide range of product brands and advanced water and wastewater treatment systems and technologies, as well as mobile and emergency water supply solutions and service contract options through our branch network. We are headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and have operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, the United Kingdom (“UK”), the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, the People’s Republic of China, Singapore and India.
We provide solutions across the entire water cycle. The water cycle begins with influent water, which is sourced from rivers, lakes, and other sources. We treat influent water for use in a wide variety of industrial, commercial, and municipal applications, including use as process water in manufacturing, power generation, and other industrial applications, use as ingredient water in the production of food, beverage, and other goods, use in laboratory testing, use by commercial aquatic facilities, and to produce safe drinking water. After the water is used it is considered effluent water, and we treat it to remove impurities so that it can be discharged safely back into the environment or reused for industrial, commercial, or municipal applications.
We target attractive global end markets that utilize and treat water as a critical part of their operations or production processes, including life sciences, light and general industry, power, microelectronics, chemical processing, food and beverage, municipal drinking water and wastewater, aquatics, refining and marine end markets. While a decline in 
general global and economic conditions could adversely affect us, our business is highly diversified across these key end markets, and we believe that no single end market drives the overall results of our business.
Our Business Segments
Our business is organized into two reportable segments: a customer-facing service organization called Integrated Solutions and Services (“ISS”) and a product technology group called Applied Product Technologies (“APT”) focused on sales primarily through indirect channels.
As further described below, our ISS segment provides application-specific solutions and full lifecycle services for critical water and wastewater applications across numerous end markets, and our APT segment provides highly differentiated and scalable water and wastewater products and technologies as stand-alone offerings or components in integrated solutions. The chart below reflects revenue by segment for the year ended September 30, 2022:

Customers
Our customers span a diverse range of end markets, including life sciences, light and general industry, power, microelectronics, chemical processing, food and beverage, municipal drinking water and wastewater, aquatics, refining and marine end markets. We sell directly to end users in these end markets and also to intermediaries, such as OEMs, system integrators, regional distributors, and engineering firms. Our business is not dependent on any single customer or end market. During the year ended September 30, 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 1.8% of our revenue, and our top ten customers accounted for approximately 9.7% of our revenue.
We provide products, services, and solutions to federal, state and local government customers both directly and indirectly as a supplier to general contractors. Many of our government contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless of whether we are the prime contractor or a subcontractor. Upon a termination for convenience, we are generally able to recover the purchase price for delivered items and reimbursement of allowable work in process costs.
Suppliers
We maintain a cost-effective and diversified procurement program focused on supply chain continuity and customer fulfillment, utilizing strong relationships with strategic suppliers across key commodities. Our diversified supply base spans across multiple suppliers and geographies, which we believe enables us to be cost-effective and responsive. The top materials in our supply chain include chemicals, membranes, resin, metal fabrications, carbon, and electrical components. 
Procurement strategy within the project environment is focused on enhancing our ability to meet individual customer needs, with particular focus on more complex installation projects. We seek to create products that align with our existing manufacturing core competencies and that enable us to provide our customers with the highest level of value. 
During fiscal 2022, we experienced increases in the cost of, and lead times for, certain materials used in our operations, and we expect these supply chain challenges to continue in fiscal 2023. We have undertaken significant efforts to maintain supply chain continuity, customer fulfillment and mitigate the impact of inflation, such as bolstering inventory to include safety stock. These challenges did not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2022. Long term supply chain planning continues to be a focus across the company in order to mitigate future potential supply chain issues. 
Seasonality
Our business may exhibit seasonality resulting from our customers’ increasing demand for our products and services during the spring and summer months as compared to the fall and winter months. For example, we experience increased demand for our odor control product lines and services in the warmer months which, together with other factors, typically results in improved performance in the second half of our fiscal year. Inclement weather and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, winter storms, droughts, and floods, can also have varying impacts on our business. Certain events may cause customer shutdowns that prevent or defer our performance of services or sale of equipment, while other events may drive increased demand for our products and services, particularly emergency response services. As a result, our results from operations may vary from period to period.
Sales and Marketing
Our ISS segment markets its offerings through a direct sales and service team, which is organized geographically and by end market and is complemented by an inside sales force, field sales engineers, and a growing e-commerce platform. Our key end markets served by our ISS segment are light manufacturing, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, biotech, power, microelectronics, chemical processing, food and beverage, and refining.
Our APT segment markets its offerings primarily through indirect channels to serve the global market or through our ISS segment’s sales organization as part of broader solutions. APT maintains relationships with OEMs, system integrators, third party sales representatives, regional distributors, engineering firms, and various other end users through our direct technical sales force to drive adoption of our offerings. APT maintains a comprehensive municipal representative network in the U.S., providing us with an opportunity to influence specifications and the basis of design for new treatment facilities. 
Growth Opportunities
Despite the potential for an economic recession in the near term, we believe the global water market is positioned to grow over the long term, supported by a variety of anticipated secular trends that will drive demand for clean water across a multitude of industrial, commercial, and municipal applications. These secular trends include water and climate risk, health and safety, connectivity, population growth, and overall economic growth. Less predictable water availability and increased water scarcity are among the anticipated effects of climate change. Accessing water from current sources is becoming increasingly challenging, so the development of non-traditional sources of water and recycle and reuse technologies will be required. 
The supply of clean water could be further impacted by factors including aging water infrastructure within North America and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. As global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, we expect demand for solutions and services will continue to increase. Additionally, a decrease in the supply of clean water, as well as a heightened focus on environmental sustainability across various end markets, may increase the demand for closed-loop solutions that allow recycling and reuse of effluent water for certain applications. In order to position the company to meet this demand, key elements of our growth strategy include:
Provide a higher value-add service-based business model to our customers. Many of our customers require water that meets a particular specification to facilitate the operation of their own businesses. Our goal is to provide reliable water treatment solutions by combining our products and technologies with our extensive service and distribution capabilities, enabling our customers to outsource their water treatment needs to us and focus on their core businesses. Our outsourced 
water offerings are high value add solutions utilizing our owned assets to generate service revenue. An example is our Water One® service platform, which uses digitally connected remote monitoring technology to provide customers with predictive and proactive service, usage-based pricing, and simplified billing. Our recycle and reuse offerings allow our customers to reduce their overall water consumption, consistent with many of our customers’ own sustainability goals and initiatives. 
Drive margin expansion and cash flow improvements through continued focus on strategic pricing, operational excellence, execution and cost savings initiatives.  During fiscal 2022, we continued deployment of our robust strategic pricing program to focus on efficient and effective price increase implementation with the objective of recovering increased supply chain costs and capturing appropriate value for our innovations. Dedicated resources and systems have been put in place to institutionalize these practices. Although we were able to offset increased material costs through our pricing initiatives during fiscal 2022, inflationary pressures have limited, and may continue to limit, our ability to achieve margin expansion. In parallel, we are pursuing several discrete initiatives that, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next two years. These initiatives include our continuing supply chain improvement program to consolidate and manage global spending, capturing benefits of our Water One® service platform as well as expanding our digital and connected solutions offerings, evaluating potential facility consolidations, and further optimizing our engineering cost structure, our global shared services organization, and our sales, inventory and operations planning. 
Continue to expand our capabilities for the treatment of increasingly complex emerging contaminants. Emerging contaminants such as PFAS, PFOA, selenium, micro-plastics and many others, may present global health risks if not properly removed from drinking water, process water and wastewater. Our portfolio of water treatment products and solutions includes multiple technologies for removal of emerging contaminants from water, such as granular activated carbon, ion exchange resin, reverse osmosis, and advanced oxidation processes. In addition, we have an extensive service branch network, located predominantly in the United States, as well as a large fleet of mobile assets to respond quickly to customers’ water treatment needs.
Continue to evaluate and pursue accretive acquisitions to add new technologies, attractive geographic regions and end markets. As a complement to our organic growth initiatives, we view acquisitions as a key element of our overall growth strategy. We target acquisitions that we believe will enable us to accelerate our growth in our current addressable market, new geographies, and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has helped us expand our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhance our portfolio of technologies.
During the year ended September 30, 2022, we completed the following acquisitions:
•On January 3, 2022, we acquired the Mar Cor Business. Headquartered in Plymouth, Minnesota, the Mar Cor Business’ offerings include hemodialysis water treatment equipment and services, commercial and industrial water treatment equipment and services, manufactured hollow fiber filters, distributed pleated fiber filters, hemodialysis liquid and powder concentrates, filter reprocessing equipment, and other ancillary supplies and equipment for use in the hemodialysis market. The addition of the Mar Cor Business expands our service footprint in North America and furthers our reach into the healthcare end market. This business is part of our ISS segment. 
•On April 1, 2022, we acquired the remaining 32% equity interest in Frontier Water Systems, LLC (“Frontier”), following our initial acquisition of a 60% equity interest in Frontier in October 2019 and our acquisition of an additional 8% equity interest in Frontier in April 2021. San Diego-based Frontier is a leading supplier of engineered equipment packages for high-rate treatment of selenium, nitrate, and metals in water and wastewater. The business adds to our portfolio of advanced wastewater treatment technologies and is part of our ISS segment. 
•On July 1, 2022, we acquired Smith Engineering, Inc. (“Smith Engineering”), a leader in the design, manufacturing, and service of custom high purity water treatment equipment serving the biotech/pharmaceutical, data center, food and beverage, healthcare, medical device, and microelectronics markets. Smith Engineering offers a variety of water treatment products and services, including filtration, UV, reverse osmosis, and deionization and is part of our ISS segment.
•On July 15, 2022, we acquired Epicor, Inc. (“Epicor”), a supplier of specialty resins for power steam system treatment for fifty years. The resins provide a cost-effective and efficient method for creating and maintaining a continual supply of ultra-pure water for power plants. Epicor is part of our ISS segment.
Research, Development, and Engineering
We utilize a disciplined, stage-gate process consisting of development, field test, commercialization, supply chain and sourcing decisions to identify and develop new technologies for commercialization. We also partner with leading universities, research centers and other outside agencies to explore potential developments.
As of September 30, 2022, our global research, development, and engineering footprint included twelve facilities located in the U.S., the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and India, staffed with managers, scientists, researchers, engineers, and technicians. This includes the new Sustainability and Innovation Hub that we opened in October 2021 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This 18,000 square-foot facility houses a hands-on demonstration and training area, a pilot testing environment, and a laboratory to grow our analytical and feasibility study capacity. We expect this facility to advance our research and development capabilities and enable further development of water treatment technologies. Our total expected investment in this facility is approximately $5.6 million, of which $5.3 million has been recognized as of September 30, 2022. 
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business, but we do not believe our business as a whole to be materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 1,750 granted or pending patents (after giving effect to patents transferred as a result of acquisitions and dispositions to date). We undertake to strategically and proactively develop our intellectual property portfolio by pursuing patent protection, obtaining copyrights and registering our trademarks in the U.S. and in foreign countries. We currently rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and control access to our intellectual property through license agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements with third parties, employment agreements and other contractual rights, to protect our intellectual property rights.
Competition
Our industry is highly fragmented and includes a number of regional and niche offering focused competitors. Competition is largely based on product performance and reliability, pricing of products and services, ability to provide service and support, application expertise and process knowledge, brand reputation, energy and water efficiency, product compliance with regulatory and environmental requirements, product lifecycle cost, scalability, timeliness of delivery, the proximity of service centers to customers, and the effectiveness of distribution channels. Within each of our segments and the various businesses that comprise them, we compete with a variety of companies, but we do not consider any single company to be a key competitor to our business as a whole.
Backlog
Backlog represents the expected future revenue for unfulfilled and remaining performance obligations for capital projects where neither Evoqua nor the customer can terminate the contract without penalty. As of September 30, 2022, our backlog was approximately $377.1 million.
Human Capital Resources
We believe our talent within the organization is key to our long-term success. Our human capital management philosophy and objectives focus on creating a high-performance culture in which employees are enabled, empowered, and accountable to deliver results. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 4,500 employees. Of these employees, approximately 58% were full-time salaried staff, and the remaining employees consisted of a mix of full-time and part-time hourly workers. Approximately 76% of our employees worked in our U.S.-based operations, and approximately 24% worked in non U.S.-based operations as of September 30, 2022. None of our facilities in the U.S. or Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements. As is common in Germany and the Netherlands, our employee populations there are represented by works councils.
In fiscal 2022, we gathered feedback from our employees through stay interviews, pulse surveys, and focus groups, as well as information from prospective employees, about what attracts them to an employer. This data helped us refine our attraction, retention, and development strategies. Based on the feedback we received, we have aligned our attraction, retention, and development strategies and objectives to focus primarily on safety, professional development, inclusion and diversity (“I&D”), health, wellbeing, and flexibility, recognition, and purpose. These strategies and objectives are incorporated into our overall business management process through the programs, policies, and initiatives discussed below. 
Safety
The health and safety of our employees is our top priority. Fostering a safe working environment is critical to our ability to attract and retain talent and to earn and keep the trust of our customers. Evoqua has a robust Environmental, Health, and Safety (“EHS”) management system that includes programs, policies, and tools to manage our EHS risks for the enterprise. Our operating divisions conduct monthly safety reviews with all organizational levels. At the executive level, each recordable accident is reviewed with our CEO and leadership team, and we conduct quarterly safety performance reviews with our Board of Directors. We routinely review key performance indicators and conduct regular facility audits, and every employee is empowered to use our Stop Work program when he or she has a concern or sees the potential for injury.
In fiscal 2022, Evoqua emphasized zero incident safety culture training to our leaders and our manufacturing and field service employees, which includes training on how to observe and provide feedback to employees with a focus on positive interactions – for example, recognizing and thanking employees for demonstrating safety best practices. Our employees use mobile devices and applications to enter and track observations in real time. 
Professional Development
Leveraging the strength of our existing team is critical to meeting the needs of our customers. As such, we are continuing to invest in our talent through the development and broadening of skills and perspectives. In fiscal 2022, we launched our Intentional Leadership program, which is a sixteen-week course focused on the development of our leaders throughout the organization. In addition, we launched an enterprise sales orientation program, which is intended to develop the skills sales employees need to support our customers. 
We continue to emphasize the development of our employees, and we had in place documented career paths for approximately 63% of our employees at the end of fiscal 2022. Career paths are intended to show employees how their career can evolve at Evoqua. A key factor in our overall success has been internal development. We have seen a large increase in internal, cross-functional moves and have implemented a career lattice to aid employees in navigating their careers across different disciplines within the organization. 
Our Leadership Development Program (“LDP”) continues to grow through enhanced rotational opportunities, and we are recruiting our largest LDP class to date for the 2023 cohort. We expanded our reach to more schools and universities and put additional focus on schools with I&D initiatives that are aligned to our own. Over the last six years of the program, the LDP has had a retention rate of approximately 81%. In fiscal 2022, we had 12 individuals in LDP roles with approximately 42% female representation. 
Inclusion and Diversity 
Our I&D strategy is critical to the success of our business. We believe that inclusion enables diversity to thrive and that our differences make us better together. In fiscal 2022, we evolved our internal communications strategy to include I&D celebrations, educational awareness of I&D holidays and awareness days, and we launched robust I&D intranet sites for our employees to learn more about these topics. One of our largest I&D communication campaigns was our “I Am Evoqua” campaign, which highlighted how our differences as individual employees make us better and stronger together. To aid us in enhancing our inclusive environment, we conducted stay interviews with women at Evoqua during fiscal 2022, and we are creating action plans from the findings of these conversations. In addition, we launched a pulse survey with an Inclusion Index to develop a baseline from which to measure future inclusion efforts.
In fiscal 2022, we performed additional targeted outreach to underrepresented candidates through partnerships with outreach vendors, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and other diverse organizations. This outreach has resulted in an increase in the number of women globally and minorities in our U.S. self-identified workforce. As of September 30, 2022, women made up approximately 21% of our global workforce, and U.S. minorities made up approximately 25% of our U.S. self-identified workforce. As of September 30, 2022, women made up approximately 22% of our senior leadership globally, and U.S. veterans made up approximately 6% of our U.S. workforce. We have evolved our talent programs to support I&D in our internal talent movement across the organization with a heavy focus on increasing diversity in succession pipelines and development programs. 
In order to attract diverse talent into the organization we have enhanced hiring manager training and coaching, implemented diverse interview panels and candidate slate processes, and evaluated job profiles with the objective of eliminating gender bias from postings. We have created an I&D scorecard to identify additional areas of improvement and enhanced our I&D governance by including metrics and action areas in regular business reviews.
We embrace I&D not only in our employment practices but also in our director selection. Since October 2018, our Corporate Governance Guidelines have provided that diverse candidates, including women and minorities, must be included in each pool of candidates from which we select new directors, otherwise known as the “Rooney Rule.” Our current Board of Directors is 33% gender diverse and 33% racially or ethnically diverse, and four of the five directors who have joined our Board since our initial public offering self-identify as diverse by reason of race, ethnicity, and/or gender.
Health, Wellbeing, and Flexibility
In fiscal 2022, we held workshops to educate our managers on our flexible work arrangements program to support them in helping our employees work effectively. To accelerate adoption of our flexible work arrangements program, we held onsite events to welcome employees into the location and enhance employee connection in a hybrid environment. We understand that, no matter their role in the organization, employees generally prefer some type of flexibility. Therefore, we launched a pilot for flexible work schedules at one of our production facilities to allow for a creative way to support flexibility for onsite roles. In fiscal 2023, we plan to review this pilot and broaden the efforts. 
Certain offerings intended to support employee wellbeing include our expanded employee benefits offerings, financial education webinars and coaching, and our employee assistance program, which offers confidential help for a wide array of concerns such as relationships, family issues, general stress, personal loss, financial hardship and parenting. 
Recognition
Recognition continues to be a vital part of our organizational high-performance culture. In fiscal 2022, we implemented a global recognition platform, allowing for new ways to recognize and reward at Evoqua, enabling all employees to post and recognize each other’s contributions. Additionally, we held onsite “Better Together” global employee appreciation events, thanking employees for delivering results no matter their work location and celebrating successes. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to extensive and varied laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to anti‑corruption and trade, anti-money laundering, import and export compliance, antitrust, data security and privacy, employment, workplace safety, product safety and regulation, including, with respect to certain of our products, regulation of medical devices, public health and safety, environmental compliance, intellectual property, transportation, zoning, and fire codes. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we operate our business in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations.
The geographic breadth of our facilities and the nature of our operations subject our operations and products to extensive environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and permits, domestically and internationally, at national, state, and local levels throughout the world. Such laws, regulations and permits relate to, among other things, air emissions, potable and non-potable water and wastewater treatment, wastewater discharge, the generation, handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous materials and wastes, product safety and workplace health and safety. These laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on our operations and the products we distribute, and they could increase our cost of producing certain products or make certain products obsolete or less attractive in the marketplace. The failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, product recalls, third party claims, damage to property or natural resources, personal injury claims, requirements to investigate or cleanup property or to pay for the costs of investigation or cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment, remedial actions or the pulling of products from the market, and could negatively impact our reputation with customers.
Many of the customers that we serve are subject to the same or similar environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws by our customers could result in either increased or decreased demand for our products and services.
Specific laws and regulations that may affect our operations or demand for our products and services include, among others, the following.
•The federal Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) and comparable state, local and foreign laws that regulate the discharge of pollutants into streams and other waters. These laws may limit the quantity of pollutants in water discharges and require persons to apply for and obtain permits and conduct sampling and monitoring, and in some cases, treat the water. Changes in limits on the quantity of pollutants and the types of pollutants under the CWA and comparable state, local or foreign laws could affect demand for our products or services or create liability for us as the result of contamination in water we treat. 
•The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) and comparable state, local and foreign laws that set standards for drinking water quality and protect sources of public drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has issued standards for microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, and radionuclides. Changes in the SDWA or comparable state, local or foreign standards, including the addition of newly-regulated contaminants such as certain PFAS, could affect demand for our products and services and/or result in the obsolescence of our products or lead to an interruption or suspension of our operations. Additionally, increased public awareness of the presence and human health impacts of manmade chemicals and naturally occurring contaminants in drinking water may increase demand for our municipal service offerings. Correspondingly, if stringent laws or regulations are delayed or are not enacted, or repealed or amended to be less stringent, or enacted with prolonged phase‑in periods, or not enforced, then demand for our products and services may also be reduced.
•The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state, local and foreign laws that regulate substances designated as hazardous waste. Our operations involve the generation, handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous materials and wastes. Changes in materials covered or treatment, storage, and disposal requirements under RCRA and comparable state, local or foreign standards could result in increased operating costs or require additional investment in our covered facilities. 
•The Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state, local and foreign laws. The Company has been subject to claims under CERCLA, which can impose joint and several liability on “potentially responsible parties” for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of specified substances, including, under CERCLA, those designated as “hazardous substances.”
•The Toxic Substances Control Act (the “TSCA”), the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (the “FIFRA”), and comparable state, local and foreign laws that regulate the manufacture and/or distribution of certain chemical substances and/or disinfection equipment. These laws may require one-time or ongoing submissions to the EPA or state environmental agencies, including, but not limited to, information on the chemistry and toxicology of the chemical substance or products, registrations, notification, and other requirements before such products can be manufactured, distributed, or sold. Changes in these laws could affect demand for our products and services, increase our cost of operations, result in the obsolescence of our products or lead to an interruption or suspension of our operations.
We believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such regulations will have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.

The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. In addition to our website, you may read our reports, proxy and information statements, and other information that we file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
We intend to make future announcements regarding Company developments and financial performance on the “Investors” section of our website, www.evoqua.com, as well as through press releases, filings with the SEC, conference calls, and webcasts.
