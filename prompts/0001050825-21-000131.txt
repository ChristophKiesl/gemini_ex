Reportable Segments
We operate on a worldwide basis within our Americas and EMEA reportable segments plus an Other category. Additional information about our reportable segments, including financial information about geographic areas and specific product categories, is contained in Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 4 and Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Americas Segment
Our Americas segment serves customers in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, the Caribbean Islands and Latin America. Our comprehensive portfolio of furniture, architectural and technology products is marketed to corporate, government, healthcare, education and retail customers through the Steelcase, Coalesse, Smith System, AMQ, and Orangebox brands.
We serve Americas customers mainly through approximately 400 Steelcase independent and company-owned dealer locations and other non-aligned dealers, and we also sell directly to end-use customers. Our end-use customers tend to be larger multinational, regional or local companies and are distributed across a broad range of industries and vertical markets, including education, financial services, government, healthcare, information technology, insurance and manufacturing. 
Each of our dealers maintains its own sales force which is complemented by our sales representatives who work closely with our dealers throughout the selling process. The largest independent Steelcase dealer in the Americas accounted for approximately 5% of the segment’s revenue in 2021, and the five largest independent Steelcase dealers collectively accounted for approximately 17% of the segment’s revenue in 2021.
The Americas office furniture industry is highly competitive, with a number of competitors offering similar categories of products. The industry competes on a combination of insight, product performance, design, price, global service and relationships with customers, architects and designers. Our most significant competitors in the U.S. are Haworth, Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., HNI Corporation and Knoll, Inc.
EMEA Segment
Our EMEA segment serves customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily under the Steelcase, Orangebox and Coalesse brands, with a comprehensive portfolio of furniture, architectural and technology products. Our largest presence is in Western Europe, where we believe we are among the market leaders in Germany, France, Spain and the U.K.
We serve EMEA customers mainly through approximately 340 independent and company-owned Steelcase dealer locations and other non-aligned dealers, and we also sell directly to end-use customers. The largest independent Steelcase dealer in the EMEA segment accounted for less than 3% of the segment’s revenue in 2021. The five largest Steelcase independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately 12% of the segment’s revenue in 2021. Our end-use customers tend to be larger multinational, regional or local companies spread across a broad range of industries and vertical markets, including education, financial services, flexible real estate, government, healthcare and information technology.
The EMEA office furniture market is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with many local and regional manufacturers in many different markets. In several cases, these competitors focus on specific product categories.
Other Category
The Other category includes Asia Pacific and Designtex.
Asia Pacific serves customers in Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea and other countries in Southeast Asia primarily under the Steelcase brand with a comprehensive portfolio of furniture, architectural and technology products. We primarily sell directly to end-use customers as well as through approximately 60 Steelcase independent dealer locations. Our end-use customers tend to be larger multinational, regional or local companies spread across a broad range of industries and are located in both mature and emerging markets. Our competition in Asia Pacific is fragmented and includes large global competitors as well as many regional and local manufacturers.
Designtex primarily sells textiles, wall coverings and surface imaging solutions specified by architects and designers directly to end-use customers through a direct sales force primarily in North America.
Corporate
Corporate costs include unallocated portions of shared service functions such as information technology, corporate facilities, finance, human resources, research, legal and customer aviation, plus deferred compensation expense and income or losses associated with company-owned life insurance ("COLI"). Corporate assets consist primarily of unallocated cash and cash equivalents, COLI balances, fixed assets and right-of-use assets related to operating leases.
Marketing Partnerships
We have entered into marketing partnerships with a number of companies, including Blu Dot, Bolia, Carl Hansen & Son, EMU, Extremis, FLOS, Mattiazzi, Microsoft, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, Moooi, Nanimarquina, PolyVision, Tom Dixon, Viccarbe and West Elm, that are intended to allow us to offer additional products and services to our dealers and customers which are complementary to our products and services and leverage our scale. These partnerships take several forms, the most common of which involves us purchasing and reselling the partner’s products to our dealers and customers.  In other situations, we market the partner’s products to our dealers and customers and receive a fee from the partner, and we typically transport and deliver those products to our dealers and customers for a fee.  We also have marketing partnerships where we co-develop products with our partner that we manufacture or source from third parties or where we and our partner agree to co-market our products and services to customers. Most of our marketing partnerships are on a regional basis.  
Joint Ventures and Other Equity Investments
We occasionally enter into joint ventures and other equity investments to expand or maintain our geographic presence, support our distribution network or invest in new business ventures, complementary products or services. As of February 26, 2021, our investments in these unconsolidated joint ventures and other equity investments totaled $51.5. Our share of the earnings from joint ventures and other equity investments is recorded in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Customer and Dealer Concentrations
Our largest customer accounted for approximately 2% of our consolidated revenue in 2021, and our five largest customers collectively accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue. However, these percentages do not include revenue from various U.S. federal government agencies. In 2021, our sales to U.S. federal government agencies represented approximately 3% of our consolidated revenue. We do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end-use customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
No single independent Steelcase dealer accounted for more than 4% of our consolidated revenue in 2021. The five largest independent Steelcase dealers collectively accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated revenue in 2021. We do not believe our business is dependent on any single independent dealer, the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect on our business.
Manufacturing and Logistics
We have manufacturing operations throughout North America (in the U.S. and Mexico), Europe (in France, Germany, Spain, the U.K. and the Czech Republic) and Asia (in China, Malaysia and India). Our global manufacturing operations are largely centralized under a single organization to serve our customers’ needs across multiple brands and geographies.
Our manufacturing model is predominately make-to-order with lead times typically ranging from two to six weeks.  We manufacture our products using lean manufacturing principles, including continuous one-piece flow and platformed processes and products, which allow us to achieve efficiencies and cost savings and minimize the amount of inventory on hand. We largely purchase direct materials and components from a global network of integrated suppliers as needed to meet demand. We also purchase finished goods manufactured by third parties predominantly on a make-to-order basis.
We focus on enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations, and we also seek to reduce costs through our global sourcing effort. We focus on platforming our product offering and capturing raw material and component cost savings available through lower cost suppliers around the globe. These efforts enhance our leverage with supply sources, and we have been able to reduce cycle times through improvements with our partners throughout our global supply chain.
Our physical distribution system utilizes commercial transport, dedicated fleet and company-owned delivery services. We utilize a network of regional distribution centers in the Americas and EMEA to maintain efficient freight and delivery costs and improve service to our dealers and customers.
Materials
Approximately 57% of our cost of sales in 2021 related to raw materials, components and finished goods purchased from a significant number of suppliers around the world. The raw materials that we purchase and that are used in the manufacture of the components and finished goods that we purchase include steel, petroleum-based products (including plastics and foam), aluminum, other metals, wood and particleboard. During 2021, the availability of steel was negatively impacted by shortages and disruption in the steel industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and during Q1 2022, the availability of foam in the U.S. has been negatively impacted by disruption in the foam supply chain as a result of a severe weather event. These reductions in availability have not had a significant impact on our ability to manufacture and supply products to our customers, but they have negatively impacted the cost of procuring such materials. In addition, the prices for many of the raw materials, components and finished goods we procure have fluctuated in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand, and the costs of these items can be impacted by changes in import tariffs and trade barriers. Our global supply chain team continually evaluates current market conditions, the financial viability of our suppliers and available supply options on the basis of quality, reliability of supply and cost.
Research, Design and Development
Our extensive global research—a combination of user observations, feedback sessions and sophisticated analyses—has helped us develop social, spatial and informational insights into work effectiveness. We maintain collaborative relationships with external world-class innovators, including leading universities, think tanks and knowledge leaders, to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work.
Understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs across the globe. Our design teams explore and develop prototypical solutions to address these needs, which vary from furniture, architectural and technology solutions to single products or enhancements to existing products and across different vertical market applications such as healthcare and education. Organizationally, global design leadership directs strategy and project work, which is distributed to design studios around the world and sometimes involves external design services.
Our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria, including financial return metrics, and chooses which products will be developed and launched. Designers then work closely with engineers and suppliers to co-develop products and processes that incorporate innovative user features with efficient manufacturing practices. Products are tested for performance, quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations.
We incurred $48.1, $50.6 and $53.7 in research, design and development expenses in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, we sometimes pay royalties to external designers of our products as the products are sold, and these costs are not included in research and development expenses.
Human Capital Resources
We aspire to be a human-centered company committed to fostering a culture of integrity and trust, supported by our core values, which are:
•act with integrity, 
•tell the truth, 
•keep commitments, 
•treat people with dignity and respect,
•promote positive relationships,
•protect the environment, and
•excel. 
Our leaders play a critical role in curating our culture, and we have established a set of leadership pillars designed to promote empathic leadership and align leader actions with our core values and the culture we strive to create. These pillars are:
•build strong teams, 
•unite in purpose, 
•create clarity, 
•cultivate resilience, and 
•deliver results. 
We believe our employees are one of our greatest assets, and we are dedicated to the continuous learning and professional development of every employee. We invest in our employees through multiple avenues, including providing competitive pay and benefits, sharing profits through annual bonus opportunities, offering career development and professional training programs, providing inspiring and supportive spaces for our employees to work and collaborate, and offering a range of services to support our employees' physical, emotional, cognitive and financial wellbeing.
Employees
As of February 26, 2021, we had approximately 11,100 employees, of which approximately 6,300 work in manufacturing and distribution and approximately 200 are part-time. Additionally, we had approximately 800 temporary workers who primarily work in manufacturing. Approximately 50 employees in the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Outside of the U.S., approximately 2,600 employees are represented by unions or workers' councils that operate to promote the interests of workers. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We strive to create an environment where employees around the globe are valued, respected, accepted and encouraged to be authentic and to fully participate in our organization. We believe our culture helps to unlock each employee's unique contributions and amplifies the power of the individual to better serve our customers and the communities in which we live and work. We are focused on enhancing a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion through the following key objectives: 
•build diverse teams that reflect our communities,
•ensure equitable access to development opportunities across the organization, and
•develop a culture of inclusion that promotes curiosity and creativity. 
Talent Development
Talent development is essential to our business strategy, and we are continually focused on providing all our employees with the resources they need to reach their full potential. We approach talent development through a variety of tools, practices and experiences, including: 
•connecting our employees to digital learning experiences to help them thrive, 
•identifying sought out skills from our employees and designing learning paths related to these skills, 
•emphasizing an environment that values learning as an everyday practice across the organization, and
•frequent and purposeful conversations between employees and leaders that inspire achievement and growth.
Learning is how we work and how we lead. We aspire to be a learning organization that regenerates capabilities and adapts our culture as a competitive advantage. 
Compensation and Employee Benefits
Our compensation philosophy is to value the contribution of our employees, motivate achievement of strategic objectives that will contribute to our company’s success and share profits through broad-based incentive arrangements designed to reward performance for all employees. This philosophy is achieved through competitive pay and benefits and a variety of other offerings such as career development and wellbeing initiatives. We review pay ranges annually to ensure external competitiveness and internal equity. We also share profits with both salaried and hourly employees through an annual bonus opportunity based on company profitability. We believe our philosophy helps promote productive, inspired and committed individuals and teams that feel appreciated and rewarded for their contributions. 
Supporting Our Employees Through the COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took actions to protect our employees’ safety, health and wellbeing, including equipping employees with personal protective equipment, establishing social distancing practices, deep cleaning and sanitizing our manufacturing facilities and offices more frequently, installing additional physical barriers for personal workspaces, implementing temperature screening at our facilities, and instituting other measures aimed at stopping and preventing the spread of COVID-19 while maintaining business operations. Consistent with government mandates and requirements, our employees whose jobs could be performed remotely worked from home. 
In addition to ensuring the physical wellbeing of our employees during the pandemic, we adopted policies to help them in a variety of other ways. We paid the full cost of health insurance premiums for our U.S. employees while they were on temporary layoffs or reduced working hours during 2021, and we offered part-time and flexible schedules to help employees navigate the demands of work and caregiving throughout the pandemic. We also provided a range of emotional wellbeing and mental health services and offered provisions for employees to manage their cash flow through temporary adjustments to our retirement and flexible spending account programs.
Intellectual Property
We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. We also hold a number of trademarks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace. We do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of such, except the “Steelcase,” “Coalesse,” “Designtex,” "Smith System," “AMQ” and “Orangebox” trademarks.
We occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products, designs or process technology. We have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our subsidiaries.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment (“Environmental Laws”). We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all Environmental Laws. We do not believe existing Environmental Laws have had or will have any material effects upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Under certain Environmental Laws, we could be held liable, without regard to fault, for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations. We could also be held responsible for third-party property and personal injury claims or for violations of Environmental Laws relating to contamination. We are a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under Environmental Laws, including as a potentially responsible party in several Superfund site cleanups. Based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties, the total estimated cleanup costs and other financially viable potentially responsible parties, we do not believe the costs to us associated with these properties will be material, either individually or in the aggregate. We have established reserves that we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs. However, certain events could cause our actual costs to vary from the established reserves. These events include, but are not limited to: a change in governmental regulations or cleanup standards or requirements; undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties; the 
loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing toward cleanup costs and other factors increasing the cost of remediation.
