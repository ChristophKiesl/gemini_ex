First person pronouns used in this Report, such as “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer to ICU Medical, Inc. ("ICU") and its subsidiaries unless context requires otherwise.
Overview
We are a leader in the development, manufacture and sale of innovative medical devices used in infusion therapy, critical care and oncology applications.  Our product line includes needlefree connection devices, custom infusion sets, closed system transfer devices ("CSTD") for the handling of hazardous drugs, advanced sensor catheters, closed blood sampling systems, and hemodynamic monitoring systems.  Our headquarters are in San Clemente, California.

Our products are used in acute care hospitals and ambulatory clinics in more than 65 countries throughout the world. We categorize our products into three main market segments: Infusion Therapy, Critical Care and Oncology. Our primary products include:
Infusion Therapy
•Needlefree connector products
◦MicroClave® and MicroClave Clear®
◦Neutron®
◦NanoClave®
◦Clave®
◦SwabCap®
•Custom infusion sets
•Tego® needlefree hemodialysis connector
Critical Care
•Hemodynamic Monitoring Systems
•Closed Blood Sampling and Conservation Systems
•Consumable Blood Pressure Transducers
•Other Critical Care Products and Accessories

Oncology
•ChemoLock® CSTD and components
•ChemoClave® CSTD and components
•Diana® Hazardous Drug Compounding System

We sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force and through independent distributors. Additionally, we sell our products on an original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") basis to other medical device manufacturers. 
 Total revenues for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $379.4 million, $341.7 million and $309.3 million, respectively. Income from operations was $82.9 million, $68.6 million and $39.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total assets were $704.7 million, $626.8 million and $541.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Our largest OEM customer has historically been Hospira, Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc. ("Pfizer"). We began our relationship with Pfizer and its predecessor companies in 1995. Sales to Pfizer accounted for 30%, 36% and 36% of our worldwide revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
In October 2016, we entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire Pfizer’s Hospira Infusion Systems ("HIS") business. The original purchase agreement was subsequently amended and restated on January 5, 2017 and the acquisition closed on February 3, 2017 for a purchase price of 3.2 million newly issued shares of common stock of the Company and approximately $275.0 million in cash. We believe combining HIS with our current infusion therapy business will create a pure-play infusion business enabling us to offer customers a full suite of intravenous ("IV") therapy devices and solutions. The combination unifies a split distribution channel which we believe in the long-term will reduce costs and improve efficiencies. We believe that the acquisition significantly expands our footprint allowing us to potentially compete more successfully on a global scale and eliminates our single customer concentration risk that clouded our strategic value. Following the acquisition, we will report the combined revenue of ICU and HIS by the following four market segments: (1) pumps, which 
3

includes the infusion pump hardware, service revenue, dedicated consumable pump sets and software; (2) consumables, which includes our legacy IV therapy and oncology segments, non-dedicated sets, oncology and accessories; (3) IV solutions; and (4) Critical Care.
Company Background
ICU was founded in 1984 and our initial public offering was in 1992. In 1993, we launched the Clave, an innovative one-piece needlefree IV connection device. In 1998, we developed a computerized manufacturing process called SetMaker that enables us to design a custom infusion set to a customer's exact specifications and commence production in less than one day from receiving the order. Since the late 1990's, we have expanded our product offerings by introducing internally developed products and systems and from acquisitions. Key developments have included the Tego needlefree connector for use in hemodialysis, products for handling hazardous drugs including the ChemoClave and ChemoLock CSTDs, the Diana hazardous drug compounding system, the Neutron, a catheter patency device and NanoClave, a series of MicroClave Clear derivatives which are uniquely designed for incorporation into custom manifolds and sets. In August 2009, we purchased all commercial rights and physical assets from Hospira's critical care product line, which provided us control over all aspects of our critical care product line. In October 2015, we acquired Excelsior Medical Corporation’s SwabCap disinfecting cap for needlefree IV connectors to enhance our direct and OEM infusion therapy product offerings and to open new customer opportunities globally.

Products
Infusion Therapy
Infusion therapy lines, used in hospitals and ambulatory clinics, consist of a tube running from a bottle or plastic bag containing a solution to a catheter inserted in a patient’s vein.  The tube typically has several injection ports or Y-sites (conventionally, entry tubes covered by rubber caps) to which a secondary infusion line can be connected to permit constant IV administration of medications, fluids and nutrients, and to allow instantaneous IV administration of medication.
 Clave Needlefree Technology

Prior to the introduction of needle-safe connectors, a conventional infusion line terminated with a male luer connector to which a hollow-bore needle would be attached to penetrate an injection port to make a primary or secondary connection.  With the Clave technology, instead of attaching a hollow-bore needle to the male luer, the male luer without a needle is simply attached directly to the needlefree Clave port.  

All types of medications can be administered through the Clave by using a standard syringe or various types of administration sets.  The Clave can be used with any conventional peripheral or central vascular access device, both for venous and arterial applications.  The resilience of the silicone compression seal permits repeated connections and disconnections without replacing the Clave. The Clave contains no natural rubber latex.
The MicroClave is smaller than the standard Clave but is functionally similar.  The MicroClave has a feature where upon disconnection of an infusion set or syringe, there is a neutral displacement of fluid. This allows clinicians to utilize known protocols without the risk of device failure and a saline flush regimen which reduces cost and exposure to the drug heparin. The MicroClave is intended for use on all peripheral and central catheters, which allows it to be used throughout the hospital and reduces line items that the hospital may need to carry and the educational burden of having multiple devices. The MicroClave Clear is functionally identical to the MicroClave, and has a clear housing so that clinicians can visualize the fluid path. 
The NanoClave is a derivative of the MicroClave, where it is incorporated into custom manifolds and components to be used in highly customized applications generally found in neonatal and pediatric patient populations. The NanoClave is also 
4

a neutral displacement connector with a clear housing, allowing clinicians to flush the connector clear of medications and blood with minimal flush volumes. 
Neutron
The Neutron catheter patency device also features Clave technology, but includes a bi-directional silicone bellows that helps prevent blood reflux into a catheter to minimize the incidence of occlusion, or blocking of the catheter due to a blood clot. The Neutron was specifically designed to be used on patients receiving longer indwelling central venous catheters.
Tego
The Tego is a needlefree hemodialysis connector that creates a mechanically and microbiologically closed system when attached to the hub of a catheter, eliminating open catheter hubs and lowering the chance of bacterial contamination and infection. 
SwabCap
SwabCap is a consumable cap designed to disinfect needlefree connectors with 70% isopropyl alcohol. The SwabCap product line complements the Clave family of needlefree connectors, as both work together to deliver the critical elements of safety, protection and maintenance of IV catheters.
Custom Infusion Sets

We have developed innovative software systems and manufacturing processes known as SetMaker and iFactory that permit us to design a custom infusion set to a hospital’s or clinician’s exact specifications, commence production within less than a day after we receive the customer order and ship smaller orders of the custom infusion sets to the customer within three days of receipt.  While we are capable of meeting customer demand on this accelerated three-day schedule, in normal circumstances we ship within twenty-one to thirty days of receipt of the customers’ order.  This is a fraction of the time required by other custom set manufacturers.  

We serve as the exclusive manufacturer for certain custom IV products that are sold by a subsidiary of Pfizer. These products are promoted under the name SetSource. 

Infusion Therapy sales accounted for $272.6 million, or 72%, of our revenue in 2016, $244.7 million, or 72%, of our revenue in 2015 and $216.3 million, or 70%, of our revenue in 2014. Additional information regarding infusion therapy sales over the last three years is discussed in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Care Products

Critical care products are used to monitor vital signs as well as specific physiological functions of key organ systems.  We manufacture hemodynamic monitoring systems, vascular and cardiac catheters and monitoring systems and custom and interventional radiology kits that are used to monitor cardiac function and blood oxygen levels in critically ill patients.  They include all components of the invasive monitoring system.  Most of our critical care products can be sold in custom systems containing specific components to meet the individual needs of the customer, and in some cases, custom made or acquired components. 
The primary critical care products we manufacture are the following:

Hemodynamic Monitoring Systems: Q2 Plus™ CCO/SvO2 (continuous cardiac output/oximetry) computer providing advanced hemodynamic monitoring with unparalleled accuracy and reliability; and Cogent™ 2-in-1 hemodynamic monitoring system providing minimally invasive and invasive hemodynamic monitoring technologies in a single, lightweight system with wireless communication. In addition, we are the exclusive United States distributor of the LiDCO® LXi noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring system under license from LiDCO Group Plc.
SafeSet® Closed Blood Sampling and Conservation System: Blood sampling systems that provide the clinician with a convenient, needlefree method to obtain a patient’s blood sample and to administer IV fluids or drugs in conjunction with blood pressure monitoring devices. They are designed to protect the clinician from exposure to blood borne pathogens, reduce the risk of IV line contamination and reduce blood waste for the patient.
5

Transpac® Consumable Blood Pressure Transducers: Transpac transducers provide clinicians with accurate real-time access to their patient's blood pressure status in surgical and intensive care settings.
Other Critical Care Products: Venous oximetry and advanced sensing catheters, Lopez Valve® and cables and accessories for hemodynamic monitoring.
Critical care sales accounted for $53.6 million, or 14%, of our revenue in 2016, $54.3 million, or 16%, of our revenue in 2015 and $55.0 million, or 18%, of our revenue in 2014. Additional information regarding critical care sales over the last three years is discussed in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Oncology

Oncology products, known as CSTDs are used to prepare and deliver hazardous medications such as those used in chemotherapy, which, if released, can have harmful effects to the healthcare worker and environment.  In 2007, we introduced the ChemoClave CSTD, which incorporates Clave technology, and in 2013, we introduced the ChemoLock CSTD.
The preparation of hazardous drugs typically takes place in a pharmacy location where drugs are removed from vials and prepared for delivery to a patient. Those prepared drugs are then transferred to a nursing unit where the chemotherapy is administered via an infusion pump set to a patient. Components of the ChemoClave and ChemoLock product lines are used both in Pharmacy and on the nursing floors for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. Custom design capability allows for a specialized product mix within the ChemoClave and ChemoLock systems to best adapt to the existing hazardous drug handling workflow.
The primary oncology products we manufacture are the following:


• | ChemoLock Needlefree CSTD: ChemoLock was the first CSTD to receive Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") 510(k) clearance for both pharmacy (ONB) and patient administration (FPA) applications. ChemoLock prevents the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations, blocks the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminates the risk of needlestick injury.


• | ChemoClave Needlefree CSTD: ChemoClave utilizes standard ISO luer locking connections, making it compatible with all brands of needlefree connectors and pump delivery systems. ChemoClave also prevents the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations, blocks the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminates the risk of needlestick injury. 


• | Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System: Diana is an automated sterile compounding system that incorporates ChemoClave and ChemoLock consumables for the accurate, safe, and efficient preparation of hazardous drugs. It is a user-controlled automated system that provides repeatable accuracy of drug mixes, minimizes clinician exposure to hazardous drugs and reduces the risk of repetitive motion stresses for the clinician while helping to maintain the sterility of the drugs being mixed.

Oncology sales accounted for $52.3 million, or 14%, of our revenue in 2016, $41.5 million, or 12%, of our revenue in 2015 and $36.7 million, or 12%, of our revenue in 2014. Additional information regarding oncology sales over the last three years is discussed in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Revenues

We have a significant number of patents on the technology in our products and methods used to manufacture them.  We have continuing royalty and revenue share income from our technology and from time to time may receive license fees or royalties from other entities for the use of our technology.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support

As of December 31, 2016, we employed 153 people worldwide in sales, marketing and customer support.  Our sales administrative operations are in San Clemente, California, Roncanova, Italy, Houten, Netherlands, Bella Vista, NSW Australia, Ludenscheid, Germany and Johannesburg, South Africa.  We ship around the world with the majority of our sales denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro.

Domestic Sales
Domestic sales include direct and OEM U.S. sales. Total domestic sales were $266.0 million, $241.9 million and $212.7 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Direct
Direct domestic sales includes sales both to our distributors and directly to the end user of our products. Direct domestic sales accounted for 43%, 39%, and 38% of our worldwide revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Distributors purchase and stock our products for resale to healthcare providers.  One distributor accounted for 8% and two distributors accounted for 7% each of revenue in 2016.  All other distributors accounted for less than 5% of revenue in 2016.  Although the loss of one or more of our larger distributors could have an adverse effect on our business, we believe we could readily locate other distributors in the same territories who could continue to distribute our products to the same customers.
OEM

We also distribute our products on an OEM basis to other medical device manufacturers. OEM domestic sales accounted for 28%, 32%, and 31% of our worldwide revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Pfizer has been a major supplier of infusion pumps and IV solutions, and has helped us achieve market share where they have multiple products under contract with a customer or broader international distribution channels than we would have been able to have on our own. Our agreements with Pfizer, which terminated upon acquisition of Pfizer's HIS business, provided them with conditional rights to distribute certain of our Clave and other products to certain categories of customers both in the United States and foreign countries.  Depending on the product and category of customer, these rights may have been exclusive or nonexclusive.  We also served as the exclusive manufacturer for certain custom IV products that are sold by a subsidiary of Pfizer. These products are promoted under the name SetSource®. The loss of Pfizer as a customer would have had a significant adverse effect on our business and operating results; as such our decision to acquire HIS was in part to protect against this significant earnings exposure, accordingly this concentration risk will be eliminated going forward.

In 2015, we signed an exclusive agreement with Medline to supply them with SwabCaps for their SwabFlush syringe product used in infusion therapy.

International Sales
In 2016, we started to report our revenue based on distribution channel within our market segments with both Terumo-related geographies in Asia and sales to Medline in our OEM business, and no longer in Direct. As such, prior year results have been reported in the same manner for comparative purposes. 
In 2015, we had entered into a long-term supply agreement with Terumo Corporation of Japan for Japan and certain smaller Asian countries.  In accordance with the agreement, Terumo distributes our entire product portfolio, including IV therapy and CSTD product lines.  Japan and Asia remains a valuable growth market.
International sales were $113.4 million, $99.8 million and $96.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

 International sales through our direct channels, including distributors and directly to the end customer, were $92.8 million, $81.3 million and $76.9 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. International sales as an OEM supplier were $20.6 million, $18.5 million and 19.7 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
In 2016, customers in Europe were served by our facilities in Slovakia, Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany.  We serve the rest of the world from our facilities in the United States and Mexico.  In 2015, we made the decision to begin shutting down our manufacturing facility in Slovakia and to move those products to our facility in Mexico. We completed the closure of those facilities in the second half of 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had 20 sales and sales support personnel serving Europe and 27 serving Asia Pacific, Southeast Asia, Latin America, South Africa, the Middle East and Canada.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing of our products involves injection molding of plastic and silicone parts, manual and automated assembly of the molded plastic parts and other components, quality control inspection, packaging and sterilization.  We mold most of our proprietary components, and perform all assembly, quality control, inspection, packaging, labeling and shipping of our products.  Our manufacturing operations function as a separate group, producing products for the marketing and sales groups.
 We own a fully integrated medical device manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah with approximately 450,000 square feet of state-of-the art manufacturing space.  This building includes approximately 109,500 square feet of class 100,000 clean room area, approximately 36,000 square feet of other manufacturing space, approximately 77,000 square feet of warehouse space and approximately 155,000 square feet of office space.  
Our state-of-the-art injection molding technology and highly automated assembly systems are designed to maintain a high level of product quality and achieve high volume production at low unit manufacturing costs.  To achieve these advantages and to gain greater control over raw material and finished product delivery times, we mold the majority of our proprietary molded components.  The raw materials for our molding operation are principally resins and silicones, and these materials are available from several sources.  Our exposure to commodity price changes relates primarily to certain manufacturing operations that use resin. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices through our procurement and supply chain management practices.
Most of our manual assembly during 2016 was done at our facilities in Ensenada, Mexico. Our Vrable, Slovakia facilities were closed during 2016. Our Mexico facilities were recently expanded to approximately 308,000 square feet, which has an electron beam ("e-beam") sterilizer and has approximately 125,000 square feet and 62,000 square feet, respectively, of space for production and warehousing.  Principal products assembled manually in Mexico are used in conjunction with infusion therapy systems (which includes oncology) and critical care systems. 
The majority of the infusion and oncology products we manufacture are sterilized in processes which use e-beam radiation.  Most critical care products and other certain products are currently sterilized in processes using gamma radiation or ethylene oxide gas (“EO”).  We have our own sterilization facilities at our plant in Mexico which is used to sterilize most of the products assembled in that plant.  All other sterilization is done by independent contractors.

We also assemble compounders in our leased facility in Ludenscheid, Germany and Salt Lake City, Utah.  
Government Regulation

Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices and combination drug/device products in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The Federal Trade Commission also regulates the advertising of our products. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny. 
U.S. Device Classification and Clearance
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDC Act") also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a pre-market approval ("PMA") application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. 
Under the FDC Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. 
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and 
8

appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. 
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and postmarket surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is "substantially equivalent," as defined in the statute, to a legally marketed "predicate" device.

To be "substantially equivalent," the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. 
If the FDA determines that the device is not "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device, or if the device is classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. 
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. Such devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA's satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA's satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. 
Post-Approval Regulation
        Even after a device has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. If such post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug or device. After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include, but are not limited to:

• | the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;


• | the FDA’s current QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow elaborate design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;


• | labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;


• | advertising and promotion requirements;


• | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;


• | annual reporting requirements;


• | the FDA's general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or "off-label" uses;


• | the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;

9


• | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act that may present a risk to health;


• | recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the drug or device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;


• | an order of repair, replacement or refund;


• | device tracking requirements; and


• | post-approval study and postmarket surveillance requirements.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Manufacturing Regulation
We must also comply with FDA, International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) and European Council Directive 93/42/EEC (“Medical Device Directive”) regulations governing medical device manufacturing practices.  The FDA, state, foreign agencies and ISO require manufacturers to register and subject manufacturers to periodic FDA, state, foreign agencies and ISO inspections of their manufacturing facilities.  We are a FDA and ISO registered medical device manufacturer, and must demonstrate that we and our contract manufacturers comply with the FDA’s QSR and current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMPs").  Under these regulations, the manufacturing process must be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures and the ability to produce devices that meet the manufacturer’s specifications must be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every critical aspect of the process. They also require investigation of any deficiencies in the manufacturing process or in the products produced and detailed record keeping.  Further, the FDA and ISO’s interpretation and enforcement of these requirements has been increasingly strict in recent years and seems likely to be even more stringent in the future. Failure to adhere to QSR, applicable cGMPs and ISO standards would cause the products produced to be considered in violation of the applicable law and subject to enforcement action.  The FDA and ISO monitor compliance with these requirements by requiring manufacturers to register with the FDA and ISO, and by subjecting them to periodic FDA and ISO inspections of manufacturing facilities.  If an FDA or ISO inspector observes conditions that might be violative, the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily, or face potential regulatory action that might include physical removal of the product from the marketplace.

We believe that our products and procedures are in compliance with all applicable FDA and ISO regulations.  There is no assurance, however, that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will be cleared by the FDA and classified as Class II products, or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the FDA, ISO or agencies in other jurisdictions.  In addition, changes in FDA, ISO or other federal or state health, environmental or safety regulations or their applications could adversely affect our business.
To market our products in the European Community (“EC”), we must conform to additional requirements of the EC and demonstrate conformance to established quality standards and applicable directives.  As a manufacturer that designs, manufactures and markets its own devices, we must comply with the quality management standards of EN ISO 13485. Those quality standards are similar to the QSR regulations.

Manufacturers of medical devices must also conform to EC Directives such as Council Directive 93/42/EEC and their applicable annexes.  Those regulations assure that medical devices are both safe and effective and meet all applicable established standards prior to being marketed in the EC.  Once a manufacturer and its devices are in conformance with the Medical Device Directive, the “CE” Mark may be affixed to its devices.  The CE Mark gives devices unobstructed entry to all the member countries of the EC.

We have demonstrated conformity to the regulation of EN ISO 13485 and the Medical Device Directive and we affix the CE Mark to our device labeling for product sold in member countries of the EC.
10

We believe our products and systems are in compliance with all EC requirements.  There can be no assurance, however, that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will conform or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the EC.
Other Healthcare Laws 
We are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; 


• | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;


• | the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;


• | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;


• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners; and


• | analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to track and report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or pricing, marketing expenditures and information; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Due to the breadth of these laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our sales and marketing practices and/or our relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers might be challenged under such laws. If our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from our participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
Coverage and Reimbursement; Cost Containment
Our profitability and operations are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes in private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies. Our products are purchased by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers that typically bill various third-party payors, such as 
11

governmental programs, private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services and products provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services and products from third-party payors is critical because it affects which products customer purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Third-party payors are increasingly reducing coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare services and products and challenging prices charged for healthcare services and products. 
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. In the United States, there has been an increase in political support for controlling significant price increases of drug products, in particular due to high-profile cases that have gained national attention and triggered Congressional inquiries. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms in the reimbursement system in the U.S. and abroad or adverse decisions relating to coverage or reimbursement could have an impact on acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.

Competition

The market for infusion therapy, critical care and oncology products is intensely competitive. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon our continued innovation and the quality, convenience, reliability, patent protection and pricing of our products, in addition to access to distribution channels. We encounter significant competition in these markets both from global, large, established medical device manufacturers and from smaller companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to differentiate our products based on innovation, safety, product quality, cost effectiveness, ease of use and convenience, as well as our ability to perceive and respond to changing customer needs. In the long term, we expect that our ability to compete will continue to be enhanced by our ability to reduce unit-manufacturing costs through improved production processes and higher volume production.
In the infusion therapy market, we currently hold the market leading position for needlefree infusion devices, including the original Clave, the MicroClave and the MicroClave Clear. These products compete with, and currently contemplated new products will likely compete with, needlefree infusion devices and systems marketed by Baxter Healthcare Corporation (“Baxter”), B. Braun Medical, Inc. (“B. Braun”), Becton Dickinson and Company ("Becton Dickinson"), Fresenius Kabi ("Fresenius"), Pfizer in certain non-exclusive markets and others. Although we believe that our needlefree infusion devices and custom set manufacturing capabilities have distinct advantages over competing systems, there is no assurance that they will be able to compete successfully with these products.
In the oncology market, we compete with other manufacturers of CSTDs for the safe handling of oncology drugs, most notably Becton Dickinson, and B. Braun. We believe that our current product offering provides benefits over these competing systems in several areas related to safety, ease of use, and cost; however, on-going innovation in this market space will be required, and there is no assurance that these innovations will be able to sustain continued growth.
The market for our critical care devices is highly competitive and our success in this area has historically been based on competitive pricing, customer service and differentiated product features such as customization. The overall market for critical care products has been shifting in recent years from the invasive pulmonary artery catheter segment to less invasive technologies to deliver patient hemodynamic status data. In 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the Cogent 2-in-1 Hemodynamic Monitoring System, which will combine invasive and minimally invasive technologies in a single monitor.
Manufacturers of products with which we currently compete, or might compete with in the future, include large companies with an established presence in the healthcare products market and substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution, managerial and other resources. In particular, Baxter, Becton Dickinson (which acquired CareFusion), Fresenius and B. Braun are leading distributors of infusion and oncology systems, Edwards Life Sciences Corporation has a significant share of the critical care hemodynamic monitoring market, while Navilyst Medical, Inc., and Merit Medical Systems, Inc., are competitors in the angiography kit market. Several of these competitors have broad product lines and have been successful in obtaining contracts with a significant number of hospitals to supply substantially all of their product requirements in these areas. In order to achieve greater market penetration or maintain our existing market position, we have established strategic relationships with OEM customers such as Terumo, and Medline. 
We believe the success of our market-leading needlefree connector line has and will continue to motivate others to develop needlefree connectors, which may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as ours. We are aware of a number of such products. We believe some of those products were developed by companies who currently have the distribution or financial capabilities equivalent to or greater than those that we have, and by other companies that we 
12

believe do not have similar capabilities, although some of those products may be distributed in the future by larger companies that do have such capabilities. We believe these products have had a moderate impact on our needlefree connector business to date, but there is no assurance that our current or future products will be able to successfully compete with these or future products developed by others.
We believe the success of our CSTD products has and will continue to motivate others to develop competing systems. Our ability to compete in the area of oncology will be particularly affected by clinical differentiation and quality of our products. While we believe we have advantages in these areas, there is no assurance that other companies will not be able to compete successfully with our CSTD products.
We believe that our ability to compete in the custom products market depends upon the same factors affecting our existing products, but will be particularly affected by clinical differentiation, quality and delivery times to the customer. While we believe we have advantages in these areas, there is no assurance that other companies will not be able to compete successfully with our custom products. 
Patents

We have United States and/or certain foreign patents relating to the technologies found in the Clave / MicroClave Connector, MicroClave Clear Connector, Neutron Connector, CLC2000 Connector, Tego Connector, ChemoClave Technologies, ChemoLock Technologies, Click Lock Technology, SwabCaps, Custom Set Design and Manufacturing Methods, and Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System. We have applications pending for additional United States and/or foreign patents on MicroClave Connector, Neutron Connector, Tego Connector, Y-Clave Connector with Integral Check Valve, ChemoClave Technologies, ChemoLock Technologies, and Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System.

Within the last two years, ICU has received three U.S. patents covering our MicroClave Clear connector.  As customer preference continues to migrate toward clear connectors, these patents will protect the market for our MicroClave Clear connector through 2032.  We also have multiple continuation patent applications pending for a number of our products, which may issue in the future.
Our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.  While we have obtained certain patents and applied for additional United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products, there is no assurance that any additional patents will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will prevent competitors from introducing similar devices or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged.  Our patents are important in preventing others from introducing competing products that are as effective as our products.  The loss of patent protection on Clave/MicroClave, Neutron, ChemoClave and ChemoLock technologies, Custom Set Design and Manufacturing Systems could adversely affect our ability to exclude other manufacturers from producing effective competitive products and could have an adverse impact on our financial results. 
The fact that a patent is issued to us does not eliminate the possibility that patents owned by others may contain claims that are infringed by our products.

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry.  Litigation, which would result in substantial cost to us and in diversion of our resources, may be necessary to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.  Adverse determinations in such litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, we have initiated litigation, and may continue to initiate litigation in the future, to enforce our intellectual property rights against those we believe to be infringing on our patents.  Such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources.

Seasonality/Quarterly Results

The healthcare business in the United States is subject to quarterly fluctuations due to frequency of illness during the seasons, elective procedures, and over the last few years, the economy. In Europe, the healthcare business generally slows down in the summer months due to vacations resulting in fewer elective surgeries.  In addition, we can experience fluctuations in net sales as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of our largest customers, which may be driven more by production scheduling and their inventory levels, and less by seasonality.  Our expenses often do not fluctuate in the same manner as net sales, which may cause fluctuations in operating income that are disproportionate to fluctuations in our revenue.
