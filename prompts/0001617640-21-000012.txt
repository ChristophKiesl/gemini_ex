Item 1. Business.
Overview
Our mission is to give people the power to unlock life’s next chapter. Whether selling, buying, renting or financing residential real estate in the U.S., customers can turn to Zillow to transact with speed, certainty and ease. Millions of people visit our mobile applications and websites every month to begin their journey with us. Traffic to our services reached an annual high of 245 million unique users in July 2020, with more than 9.6 billion visits to our mobile applications and websites in 2020, primarily to Zillow, Trulia and StreetEasy. 
At the core of Zillow is our inimitable, living database of more than 135 million U.S. homes and our differentiated content, most notably the Zestimate, our patented proprietary automated valuation model through which we provide real-time home value estimates. With the launch of the Zestimate in 2006, we introduced important transparency to real estate in order to empower consumers to make better decisions. Our improved Zestimate currently has a median absolute percent error of 1.8% for homes listed for sale and 7.4% for off-market homes. Our data and content has helped the Zillow brand become synonymous with real estate. Today, more people now search for “Zillow” than “real estate,” according to a 2020 Google Trends report, and Zillow is the most visited brand in the industry according to a 2020 Comscore Media Metrix® report. 
We are in the midst of a significant, multi-year business model expansion, building on the strong foundation of our established real estate marketplaces and advertising-based revenue model as we move into facilitating real estate transactions and offering related adjacent services. Through our mobile applications and websites, we are focused on helping customers transact and move directly through our growing portfolio of Zillow-branded and affiliated transaction-oriented services and/or through referrals to trusted Zillow Premier Agent and Premier Broker partners. Our expansion has been fueled by an increased desire and growing ability to move as people rethink their relationship with home and work while increasingly turning to technology to more safely navigate many aspects of their lives, including shopping for and buying their next home. As a leading digital real estate company, we are well positioned to serve our customers and partners – both now and in the future. 
This strategic expansion has dramatically increased our Total Addressable Market (“TAM”) from $19 billion in real-estate related advertising according to a 2019 Borrell Associates report to $2.2 trillion in annual U.S. real estate transactions, which represents the estimated transaction value of existing and new homes sold in 2020, according to the US Census Bureau and National Association of REALTORS®. 
Our expansion into transaction-related services also allows us to build closer relationships with our customers to help them find and move into the places they call home throughout their lives, which is at the core of our mission. 
We have organized our business into three segments, Homes, Internet, Media & Technology (“IMT”) and Mortgages. These segments reflect the way we evaluate business performance and manage our operations. The Homes segment includes the financial results from our purchase and sale of homes directly through Zillow Offers and the financial results from the title and escrow services provided through Zillow Closing Services. The IMT segment includes the financial results for the Premier Agent, rentals and new construction marketplaces, dotloop, display and other advertising and business software solutions. The Mortgages segment includes financial results for mortgage originations through Zillow Home Loans, advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other mortgage professionals, as well as Mortech mortgage software solutions.
Customer Offerings
To deliver on our mission, our long-term vision is to provide a seamless, integrated transaction experience for movers through Zillow, our affiliated brands or our network of trusted partners. We do this through a range of services designed to help our customers in whatever stage(s) of home they may be in. This typically includes the need for multiple services simultaneously. According to the Zillow Group 2020 Consumer Housing Trends Report, nearly two-thirds of sellers are also buying at the same time, and among renters with plans to move within the next year, more than one-third plan to buy their next home.
Table of Contents

Our services are primarily designed for the following:
For Sellers – We launched Zillow Offers in April 2018 to provide homeowners with the ability to receive cash offers to purchase their home, giving sellers peace of mind, control and convenience in one of the most stressful transactions of their lives. We have the potential to connect sellers who do not qualify for or accept an offer from Zillow with a trusted local Premier Agent partner. When we buy a home from a seller, our title and escrow business, Zillow Closing Services, performs their due diligence for a clean title and a seamless close of the home transaction. Then, our renovation teams perform light, make-ready repairs to swiftly list the home. As of December 31, 2020, Zillow Offers was available in 25 markets and accounted for $1.7 billion of our revenue for the year, up from $1.4 billion in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. This reflects less than 0.1% of the estimated annual U.S. real estate transaction value. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 4,162 homes from sellers.
For Buyers – When a buyer is ready to meet with a local real estate professional after searching for a home on our mobile applications and websites, we typically connect them with a Premier Agent partner. For customers who are focused on buying new construction homes, we connect them with our home builder partners. Home buyers are also able to purchase homes that are listed for resale through Zillow Offers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, home buyers purchased 5,337 homes through Zillow Offers. Beginning in 2019, home buyers have been able to facilitate a seamless transaction with the adjacent title and escrow services through Zillow Closing Services.
For Renters – Over 60% more residential real estate leases are executed each year (10.5 million, according to the 2019 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau) than homes sold (6.5 million, according to 2020 data from the National Association of REALTORS®, U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development) in the U.S., and we connect prospective renters with our property management and landlord partners in the Zillow Rental Network, which provides renters access to the largest collection of rental properties in the U.S., according to a 2020 Comscore Media Metrix® report. We also provide renters with the ability to easily submit applications, sign leases and make rental payments through our platform. 
For Borrowers – According to the March 2020 National Association of REALTORS® “2020 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends Report”, approximately 86% of homes purchased in the U.S. are financed with mortgage debt. We provide our customers with multiple ways to pursue mortgage financing for their transaction. We provide customers with the option to finance directly with Zillow Home Loans or to connect with our mortgage partners through our mortgage marketplace for both purchase and refinance opportunities. Zillow Home Loans, which we rebranded in 2019 following the October 2018 acquisition of Mortgage Lenders of America, is currently available in 45 states and jurisdictions and originates mortgage loans and then sells the loans on the secondary market. 
Competitive Advantages
We believe we have the following competitive advantages:
•Large and trusted brand. The Zillow Group portfolio attracted an annual high of 245 million unique users in July 2020 and more than 9.6 billion visits in 2020. Our master brand “Zillow” is searched more often than “real estate,” according to a 2020 Google Trends report, and has become the most trusted brand in the industry. Our large and engaged audience and brand trust keeps our customer acquisition costs low.
•Inimitable living database of homes and superior data science and technology advantages. Our living database of more than 135 million U.S. homes is the result of more than 15 years of substantial investment, sophisticated economic and statistical analysis and complex data aggregation of multiple sources of property, transaction and listing data, including user updates to more than 34 million property records. This data is the foundation of our proprietary Zestimate, Rent Zestimate, Zestimate Forecast and Zillow Home Value Index. In 2019, we released a new, more accurate Zestimate, incorporating key learnings from the two-year, global Zillow Prize competition. The improved Zestimate currently has a median absolute percent error of 1.8% for homes listed for sale and 7.4% for off-market homes. These data and models also provide the foundation for our pricing algorithms for Zillow Offers, although substantially more home-specific information is incorporated to further refine the valuation for this application. 
•Superior industry partnerships. Zillow Group partners with thousands of the most productive names in real estate, maintaining strong partnerships with leading real estate agents, brokers, mortgage professionals, property managers, landlords, home builders as well as regional multiple listing services and more. As we move down funnel into transaction-related services, we work to partner with high-performing and service-focused industry partners who share our interests in providing the best-possible services to our shared customers.

•Experienced, Proven Management Team. We have a highly experienced management team who have successfully built Zillow and other brands into category leaders. In the past three years, we have added executive talent with deep experience in building transaction-focused real estate, mortgage and e-commerce businesses as well as sophisticated capital market financing. The skills and experiences of our management team provide strategic insights and abilities to deliver a seamless real estate transaction experience for our customers.
•Strong Culture of Innovation and Inclusion. Zillow Group has built an award-winning culture of collaboration and innovation that is committed to employee equity and creating an environment where employees feel valued, supported and that they belong. Zillow Group has been recognized for our commitment to these efforts, being named on the “Corporate Equality Index 2020” with a score of 100 and “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality” by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. Additionally, in 2020, Zillow Group was named one of the Best Workplaces in the technology industry for Millennials, for Parents, in the Bay Area and in New York by Great Place to Work®. Zillow Group was also named one of the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® 2019 and was included on Bloomberg’s “2020 Gender Equality Index”.
•Strong Financial Position. Zillow has a strong balance sheet and a large and growing IMT business that generates substantial cash flow to help finance the expansion of our transaction-related businesses. We also have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our investments.
Total Addressable Market
We participate in large addressable markets of buying, selling, renting and financing residential real estate in the U.S. As we continue to expand into transaction-related services, our TAM has expanded from $19 billion in U.S. real estate related advertising according to a 2019 Borrell Association report to $2.2 trillion of annual home sales (according to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau and National Association of REALTORS®) in the largest asset class in the country, in which we participate directly through buying and selling homes through Zillow Offers as well as through Zillow-referred transactions, facilitated by our Premier Agent partners. In addition, Zillow is offering essential adjacent services for Zillow Offers transactions, including mortgages through Zillow Home Loans and title and escrow closing services through Zillow Closing Services. U.S. mortgage origination revenue represents a $156 billion annual opportunity (according to a 2020 Mortgage Bankers Association Report), while title and escrow represents another $32 billion annual opportunity (according to IBISWorld in 2020). 
With nearly half of all people looking to buy also considering renting (according to the Zillow Group 2020 Consumer Housing Trends Report), our complementary rentals marketplace also participates in a nearly $50 billion annual property management services industry (according to IBISWorld in 2020) by assisting our partners with listings, advertising, and leasing services in a market of nearly 43 million rental units in the U.S. (according to the 2020 U.S. Census’ Current Population Survey).
We also may explore additional adjacent opportunities in the future, including but not limited to, home insurance ($106 billion TAM according to IBISWorld 2020), home warranties ($3 billion TAM according to IBISWorld in 2020), home renovation services ($339 billion TAM according to a 2020 housing study conducted by Harvard University) and moving services (nearly $14 billion TAM according to IBISWorld in 2020).
Seasonality
Portions of our business may be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the residential real estate market, advertising spending, and other factors. Traffic to our mobile applications and websites has historically peaked during the spring and summer months, consistent with peak residential real estate activity. For further discussion on seasonality, see our Quarterly Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition
Our business depends on our ability to successfully attract, retain and provide customers with products and services that make real estate transactions faster, easier and less stressful. 
The residential real estate landscape is highly fragmented and competitive from the beginning of the search process through the closing of a transaction, typically with single point service providers, with new entrants joining at a rapid pace. According to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau and National Association of REALTORS®, 6.5 million existing and new homes were sold in the U.S., with over 106 thousand real estate brokerages (according to the National Association of REALTORS®) and over 50 thousand mortgage lenders (according to the 2020 Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System Industry Report) providing their services across the 597 different Multiple Listing Services that span the country (according to the Real Estate Standards Organization in 2020). To date, Zillow Offers makes up less than 0.1% of the housing transactions in the U.S. and Zillow Home Loans makes up less than 0.1% of the mortgages originated in the U.S. 
We compete for customers with companies that provide technology, products, and services for real estate focused customers. Factors that may influence customer decisions include the quality of the experience, value and utility of the services offered, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information available, and brand awareness and reputation. For example, our Zillow Offers business competes for customers based on price, convenience and level of service provided with companies and individuals whose primary service is buying and selling homes. For customers shopping for a mortgage, Zillow Home Loans competes with other mortgage originators based on a combination of interest rates, origination fees, product selection and the level of service we provide.
In addition, our business depends on our ability to attract and retain leading industry partners to advertise and provide services to our customer base. We compete for real estate partners based on the perceived transaction readiness of customers, return on investment, price and product offerings and the effectiveness and relevance of our products and services. Based on these and other factors, real estate partners could select other companies dedicated to providing real estate, rental, new construction and mortgage information and services to real estate professionals, local brokerage sites and major internet portals, general search engines, e-commerce and social media sites. We also compete for a share of our partners’ overall marketing budgets with traditional media as well as word-of-mouth referrals and leads from yard signs and other marketing. 
Intellectual Property
We regard our intellectual property as a key differentiator that is critical to our success and rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade-secret protection, and contractual agreements to protect our proprietary technology and data. 
Our Zestimate, which we consider to be a significant competitive advantage with respect to customer engagement, leverages patented, proprietary, automated valuation models to provide real-time home value estimates. As of December 31, 2020, we have 48 patents of varying lengths issued and 76 patent applications pending in the U.S. and internationally. These patents cover a variety of proprietary techniques relevant to our products and services, including determining a current value for real estate property and the collection, storage and display of home attribute values and creating Zillow 3D home tours and floor plans. 
In addition, awareness and loyalty to our brand enables us to effectively attract and retain our customers. To support our brand, we have registered, or applied for the registration of, trademarks, service marks and copyrights in the U.S. and several other jurisdictions, including “Zillow,” “Zestimate,” and the Z in a house logo. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.
To further protect our proprietary rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Our employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions. We control the use of our proprietary technology, data and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use and other restrictions on our mobile applications and websites.
Government Regulation
We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business and the products and services that we offer are affected by a continually expanding and evolving range of local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations. For additional information on government regulation refer to Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Human Capital Resources
At Zillow, we believe that our long-term success is dependent upon attracting, developing and retaining talented employees, and maintaining a culture that allows each employee to do their best work. We value integrity, accountability, collaboration, creativity, respect and transparency as central to our core values.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 5,504 full-time employees. Our internal data shows that 57.3% of our workforce self-identified as men and 42.7% self-identified as women, with women representing 34.9% of our leadership team (defined as director level and above). The ethnicity of our workforce was 61.7% White, 20.7% Asian, 7.1% Latinx, 5.2% Black and 5.3% for all other races. For leadership, the breakdown was 76.6% White, 14.7% Asian, 3.1% Black, 1.8% Latinx and 3.8% for all other races. The diversity of our workforce and leadership team continues to be an area of focus.
Zillow as a Distributed Workforce    
Our focus on employees has been critically important in light of the unique challenges in 2020 brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are redefining the employee experience and the future of flexible work. In April 2020, we announced that most of our employees would have the flexibility to work from home through the remainder of 2020. In July 2020, we extended that flexibility indefinitely by announcing a permanent move to a distributed workforce for most employees. As we have transitioned to a remote-first workforce, we are also using this opportunity to diversify our workforce, as we are no longer bound by the geographic limits of our physical workspaces. 
We expect that our offices will continue to be a place for teams to come together to enable productivity and collaboration. We are working to reimagine our physical workspaces to provide more space for collaboration and engagement when our employees do come into an office.
We are also restructuring our remote work to more effectively use our time together and provide more opportunities to work asynchronously. By implementing core collaboration hours, we are resetting the expectation of availability and providing greater flexibility in how we work. 
Equity and Belonging
We are committed to creating a workplace where diversity of gender, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, military status and religion are represented, embraced and respected. Our dedicated Equity and Belonging team empowers Zillow employees to build a strong community, amplify underrepresented voices, and foster a company culture where everyone can learn, grow and thrive. We maintain equity and belonging programs that include unconscious bias training, nine employee-led affinity networks for community members and allies, and support diversity in our recruitment practices and inclusive job descriptions.
Pay Equity
To support gender and under-represented pay equity, we complete a comprehensive annual evaluation with the commitment to disclose results publicly on our corporate website. Based on our assessment of compensation in 2020, we have maintained pay parity between genders doing similar work. We are included in the 2020 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, which measures equality across internal company statistics, employee policies and practices and external community support and engagement.
Career and Leadership Development 
At Zillow, we believe each of our employees should have the tools and support they need to grow their careers through experiences, resources and connections. We have a dedicated Learning and Development team, which creates educational resources and conducts training on a wide range of topics including effective communication, collaboration, as well as a sophisticated leadership training program with focused learning tracks for both new managers and experienced leaders. As we look to empower and develop our distributed workforce, we have transitioned all of our training to be virtual and launched Zillow University, our new online training portal. Zillow employees have completed nearly 90,000 hours of content on Zillow University and LinkedIn learning in 2020. 
Table of Contents

In 2020, we launched our Leadership Blueprint, a new leadership development guide that outlines our leadership philosophy, our expectations for leaders, and the behaviors that are essential to create a consistent leadership experience at Zillow. The blueprint sets expectations of the leadership behaviors we value at Zillow and provides the foundation of our leadership development programs. Our five expectations are:
•Act Decisively and Strategically
•Create Clarity from Ambiguity
•Expect the Best from Self and Others
•Foster an Environment Where All Can Thrive, Today and Tomorrow
•Build Relationships Based on Trust, Transparency, and Shared Success 
By creating clarity and providing tools to help managers determine where they can grow, we are working to instill strong, consistent leadership that will lead us into the workplace of the future.
Total Rewards
Zillow’s competitive, market-based compensation program focuses on pay-for-performance, instilling ownership by utilizing a broad-based equity approach. In addition, our class-leading benefits are reflected in investments in physical, family, mental and financial wellness programs to meet the needs of our diverse base of employees. These benefits include remote workplace flexibility, competitive health care coverage, fully paid maternity and paternity leave, a sabbatical program, wellness reimbursements, tuition support and COVID-19 caregiver resources. In 2020, in response to the demands placed on many as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our caregiver leave program to also include up to 10 days of leave with no impact to pay and a temporary three-month reduced schedule with a reduced pay option.
