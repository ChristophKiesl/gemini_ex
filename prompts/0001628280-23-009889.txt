Item 1.    BUSINESS.
Company Overview
Surgalign Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “we”), is a global medical technology company focused on elevating the standard of care by driving the evolution of digital health. We have developed an artificial intelligence (“AI”) and augmented reality (“AR”) technology platform called HOLO™ AI, which we view as a powerful suite of AI software technology which connects the continuum of care from the pre-op and clinical stage through post-op care, and is designed to achieve better surgical outcomes, reduce complications, and improve patient satisfaction. We believe HOLO AI is one of the most advanced AI technologies with applications beyond the spine and operating room. Our HOLO Portal™ surgical guidance system, a component of our HOLO AI technology platform, is designed to automatically recognize, identify, and segment patient anatomy to autonomously assist the surgeon throughout the surgical procedure. This proprietary AI-based platform was developed to be an intelligent anatomical mapping technology designed to assist surgeons by allowing them to remain in safe anatomical zones and to enhance surgical performance. We plan to leverage our HOLO AI platform to improve patient outcomes and drive adoption of our spinal hardware implants and biomaterials products. We have launched several new products and are developing a pipeline of new innovative technologies that we plan to integrate with our HOLO AI platform.
In addition to our digital health solutions, we have a broad portfolio of spinal hardware implants, including solutions for fusion procedures in the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine, motion, and a minimally invasive surgical implant system for fusion of the sacroiliac joint. We also have a biomaterials portfolio of advanced and traditional orthobiologics. 
We currently market and sell products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and healthcare providers in the United States and in approximately 40 countries worldwide. We are headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, with commercial, innovation and design centers in San Diego, California; Wurmlingen, Germany; and Warsaw and Poznan, Poland.
Reverse Stock Split
On May 10, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved the proposal to authorize the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to affect a reverse 
stock split of the Company’s common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Following Board approval on May 11, 2022, the Reverse Stock Split became effective on May 16, 2022 at a 1-for-30 ratio. The Reverse Stock Split did not modify any rights or preferences of the shares of the Company’s common stock. Proportionate adjustments were made to the exercise prices and the number of shares underlying the Company’s outstanding equity awards, as applicable, and warrants, as well as to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company’s equity incentive plans. The Reverse Stock Split did not affect the number of authorized shares of common stock or the par value of the common stock. Unless we indicate otherwise, all per share amounts and references to common shares and common share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Report”) reflect the Reverse Stock Split, and the accompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give effect to the Reverse Stock Split and have been retroactively applied.
Recent Acquisitions and Disposition
Acquisition of Equity Interest in INN
On December 30, 2021, we completed a Stock Purchase Agreement (“INN Purchase Agreement”) to acquire 42% of Inteneural Networks Inc. (“INN”) for a non-exclusive license to use INN's proprietary AI technology for autonomously segmenting and identifying neural structures in medical images and helping identify possible pathological states in order to advance our digital health strategy. At the time of acquisition, INN was a private technology company engaged in the development of technology to harness machine learning ("ML") and AI with the goal of autonomously and accurately identify and segment neural structures in medical images and integrate specific reference information regarding possible pathological states to physicians caring for patients. The acquisition of INN propels our AI capabilities and our future growth. As consideration for the 42% ownership, we paid total consideration of $19.9 million which consisted of $5.0 million in cash, issuance to the sellers 227,359 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $4.9 million and issuance of two unsecured promissory notes to the Sellers in an aggregate principal amount of $10.6 million with a fair value of $10.0 million. Pursuant to the INN Purchase Agreement, subject to certain contingencies, we are obligated to purchase up to 100% of the equity of INN if the three additional clinical, regulatory, and revenue milestones are met. With the achievement of each milestone and the satisfaction of the related contingencies, we project to acquire an additional 19.3% equity interest in INN for $19.3 million.
Prompt Prototypes LLC Acquisition
On April 30, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Prompt Prototypes LLC ("Prompt"). The Company purchased the assets of Prompt to expand its research and development capabilities, and create the capacity to produce certain medical prototypes. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, we purchased specific assets and assumed certain liabilities of Prompt for a purchase price of $1.1 million. At the closing, we paid $0.3 million in cash and issued restricted shares with an aggregate fair market value of $0.2 million to the seller. The remaining $0.6 million of the purchase price was required to be paid to the seller, contingent on the continued employment with the us, in the form of cash and restricted shares in two equal amounts on the 18th and 36th month anniversary of the closing date. On October 30, 2022, we issued our first payment to coincide with the 18-month anniversary from the closing date which consisted of $0.2 million of cash and issuance of restricted shares with an aggregate fair market value of $0.1 million. The second payment is considered future compensation and is expected to be paid on the 36th month anniversary of the closing date.
Disposition of Coflex and Cofix product lines
On February 28, 2023, pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Coflex Purchase Agreement”) by and among our indirect subsidiary Surgalign SPV, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Surgalign SPV”), Surgalign Spine Technologies, Inc, a Delaware corporation and sole stockholder of Surgalign SPV (the “Seller”), the Company and Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Xtant”), Xtant acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity of Surgalign SPV, from the Seller (the “Coflex Transaction”). The aggregate consideration paid in the Coflex Transaction for 100% of Surgalign SPV’s equity securities was $17.0 million in cash. As a result of the Coflex Transaction, Xtant acquired our Coflex and Cofix product lines in the United States and worldwide intellectual property rights therein. The Seller, Surgalign SPV and Xtant also entered into a Transition Services Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2023 (the “Transition Services Agreement”), in connection with the Coflex Transaction pursuant to which the Seller has agreed to provide certain transition services to Xtant immediately after the closing for an agreed upon transition period. 
COVID-19
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic significantly impacted our business results of operations and financial condition in fiscal years 2021 and 2022. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments implemented extraordinary measures to slow the spread of the virus, which included the mandatory closure of businesses, restrictions on travel and gatherings, quarantine and physical distancing requirements, and vaccine mandates. While market conditions 
have improved throughout the country and on a global scale, many government agencies in conjunction with hospitals and healthcare systems continue to defer, reduce or suspend certain elective surgical procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely impacted supply chains and hospitals’ staffing and administrative functions, resulting in several delays. We may continue to see delays on this front and both delays and reductions in procedural volumes as hospital systems and/or patients elect to defer spine surgery procedures, and the unpredictability of emerging variants may create unforeseen impacts on business operations.
During 2021 and 2022, we raised additional capital to solidify our financial foundation and we continue to invest in our digital health strategy, invest in our teams, and improve operating processes, while taking steps to position the Company for long-term success and improve patient outcomes notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic and/or additional variants. Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided under Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that we will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued, and we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. However, as discussed below, management has concluded that substantial doubt exists with respect to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $16.3 million and an accumulated deficit of $624.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a loss from continuing operations of $54.6 million and a net loss applicable to Surgalign Holdings, Inc. of $54.6 million. The Company has incurred losses from operations in the previous two fiscal years and did not generate positive cash flows from operations in fiscal year 2022 nor in 2021. The Company expects net operating losses for the full year 2023 as it works to commercialize its HOLO Portal™ surgical guidance system and further develop its HOLO™ AI platform and spinal device product lines.
On November 13, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single institutional investor pursuant to which we agreed to sell, in a registered direct offering (the “2022 Registered Direct Offering”), 740,000 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants exercisable for up to an aggregate of 5,260,000 shares of common stock, Series A warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock that are exercisable through November 13, 2027, and Series B warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock that are exercisable through November 13, 2025. We received gross proceeds of $12.0 million associated with the purchase agreement. Also in connection with the 2022 Registered Direct Offering, we issued placement agent warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 360,000 of common stock that are exercisable through November 13, 2027.
On February 15, 2022, we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering 1,285,507 shares of our common stock and 163,768 of pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock. In addition, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,086,956 shares of common stock that are exercisable through February 15, 2027. Also in connection with the offering, the Company issued placement agent warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 86,956 shares of common stock that are exercisable through February 15, 2027. Finally, the Company granted the underwriters the option for a period of 30 days from February 15, 2022 to purchase up to 217,391 additional shares of the Company’s common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to 163,043 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Underwriters did not exercise the option to purchase the common shares from the Company, but they did exercise the option to purchase the warrants which have not been converted to common shares as of December 31, 2022. We received gross proceeds of $20.0 million from the offering.
On June 14, 2021, we issued and sold in a registered direct offering an aggregate of 966,183 shares of our common stock and investor warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 966,183 shares of common stock. The Company, also in connection with the direct offering, issued placement agent warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 57,971 shares of our common stock that are exercisable through June 14, 2024. We received gross proceeds of $50.0 million from the offering.
On February 1, 2021, we closed a public offering and sold a total of 956,666 shares of our common stock at a price of $45.0000 per share, less the underwriter discounts and commissions. We received gross proceeds of $44.5 million from the offering. 
The Company is projecting it will continue to generate significant negative operating cash flows over the next 12-months and beyond. In management's evaluation of the going concern conclusion we considered the following: i) supply chain and labor issues, potential of a COVID-19 or related variant resurgence, inflation, and recent market volatility; ii) negative cash flows that are projected over the next 12-month period; iii) probability of payment of potential milestone payments related to the Holo Surgical and INN acquisitions should any of the milestones be achieved; iv) INN seller notes with an aggregate amount of $10.6 million due to the seller of INN on December 31, 2024; and v) various supplier minimum purchase agreements. The Company’s operating plan for the next 12-month period also includes continued investments in its product pipeline that require additional financings, including digital health, its digital health products, and certain hardware assets.
Historically, the Company has successfully funded its cash requirements with capital raised through financings and/or asset sales and intends to continue to pursue those paths to address cash shortfalls. We completed the Coflex Transaction for $17.0 million gross funds and net cash of $14.8 million to the Company.
Even with this sale, absent receipt of additional third-party funding and based on our current cash flow forecast, the Company does not expect to have adequate capital resources to meet its current obligations as they become due into the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company’s ability to meet its current obligations as they become due over the next twelve months and to be able to continue with its operations will depend on obtaining additional capital and executing its current corporate strategy. No assurance can be given that any of these actions will be completed. If the Company is unable to secure additional funding and successfully implement its planned corporate realignment programs designed to significantly reduce expenses, the Company may be required to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws and/or liquidate or reorganize its assets, which could cause us to be delisted from the NASDAQ, further limiting our ability to obtain financing.
In consideration of the inherent risks and uncertainties and the Company’s forecasted negative cash flows as described above, management has concluded that substantial doubt exists with respect to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. Management continually evaluates plans to raise additional debt and/or equity financing and will continue to attempt to curtail discretionary expenditures in the future; however, in consideration of the risks and uncertainties mentioned, such plans cannot be considered probable of occurring at this time. 
The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company’s ability to meet its funding requirements on a continuous basis to maintain existing financing to succeed in its future operations. The Company’s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.
Segments
The Company operates one reportable segment: Spine.
Strategy
Our goal is to improve patient outcomes in Spine and adjacent specialties through the deployment of intelligent digital and surgical technologies across the continuum of care. To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following strategies: 
•Leverage our digital surgery platform to improve patient outcomes. We believe the HOLO Portal™ system is the world’s first AI driven augmented reality guidance system for spine and is the first clinical application of our HOLO™ AI platform. HOLO Portal guidance includes HOLO AI neural networks, which assists the surgeon by autonomously segmenting and labelling anatomic structures from an intraoperative 3D image, and automatically suggesting a patient specific surgical plan. The result is viewed by the surgeon through the AR display and is designed to help them quickly place implants, accurately achieve surgical objectives, and reduce cognitive load. In parallel, we are working to expand the indications for HOLO AI, our portfolio of neural networks designed to analyze, segment, and measure medical images including diagnostic, intraoperative, and postoperative modalities. Our vision is to apply AI across the continuum of care to find what drives patient satisfaction, in spine as well as adjacent specialties. 
•Develop and commercialize innovative spine implants and biomaterials products. We plan to continue to drive innovation in our product offering and develop next-generation, clinically validated products with our research and development capabilities. We plan to continue to deepen our relationships with thought-leading surgeons to develop clinically validated procedures and products that deliver better patient outcomes. Key to our long-term vision is the development of products that correlate to our digital surgery platform with current focus on integration in our HOLO AI platform.
•Validate our innovative products with clinical evidence. We have a history of investing in clinical efficacy and outcomes studies to validate our products with peer-reviewed clinical evidence. There are more than 100 peer-reviewed clinical publications spanning our portfolio, including HPS® 2.0 fixation and TETRAfuse® 3D technology. We have built a strong, experienced research and clinical affairs team that we expect will bolster our clinical evidence, adding to our capabilities in digital health. We plan to gather real-world clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of our new innovative products, which will include clinical evidence in support of the HOLO Portal system and the HOLO AI platform. We plan to continue collaborating with our surgeon customers and key opinion leaders to share clinical data analyses through peer-reviewed scientific publications and conference presentations to the spine surgery and medical community. We believe such clinical data will bring increased awareness of our products and technologies and attract surgeon and patient interest.
•Realign and optimize resources to drive savings and free up resources to invest in innovation. We continue to review all product lines and processes to determine which products hold the greatest growth and value creation opportunities. As part of this process, we are retooling our product portfolio, removing older product lines with lower margin and less attractive growth prospects, which we believe will help simplify our business, remove complexity and improve the overall customer experience. Further, we are actively assessing all expense support structures in order to maximize margins and lower both operating expenses and working capital needs. With the expected savings, additional resources may be allocated to advancing digital health which includes the HOLO AI platform, spine and biologics products and specifically, products which align with our digital health strategy. 
•Strategically pursue acquisition, license, and distribution opportunities. We have experience identifying acquisition, license, and distribution opportunities and integrating new technologies to complement our product portfolio, specifically as it relates to our digital health strategy. We plan to strategically use these business development activities to supplement our internal innovations and fill key product portfolio needs and to expand our business network and addressable markets.

Industry Overview
The global spine surgery industry can be broken into various markets that align the treatment procedures for patients suffering from back-related pain and other conditions. The most prevalent markets are spine implants, composed of implantable devices to aid in both fusion and motion preservation procedures and the biomaterials market consisting of human-derived and synthetic bone growth substitute products, as well as other surgical instruments. There are also many new and emerging technologies making their way into the operating room which are also used by surgeons to aid in the treatment of spinal conditions by providing information and tools to enhance treatment planning and execution. Major categories within this segment include surgical navigation systems, robotic targeting devices and pre-surgical planning software, and incorporating the use of artificial intelligence and augmented reality. 
Artificial Intelligence
The global artificial intelligence healthcare market was estimated to be approximately $15.1 billion in 2022 and continues to gain rapid traction across the globe, fueled by the need for virtual technologies and improved efficiencies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise in various chronic diseases. Further driving demand is governments’ actions across the global to reduce healthcare costs and the medical communities’ efforts to improve technology usage across the continuum of patient care and AI provides multiple applications that improve patient outcomes in the diagnosis, procedural and post-operative treatment phases.
Spine Implants
The global spine implants market size was estimated at $12.8 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.1% from 2022 to 2030. Most revenues are estimated to be generated from spinal fusion devices and market growth is projected to be driven by an increased number of spinal cord injuries across the globe. Fusion devices are designed and developed to aid in the restoration of spinal alignment and to provide fixation during the fusion process. Conversely, motion preservation devices are designed predominantly to stabilize the spine and allow for motion of the segments. Spine implants can be surgically applied via traditional open surgery or via minimally invasive surgery. We provide devices in both segments of the spine implant market and via both surgical methodologies.
Biomaterials
The global biomaterials market size was estimated at $3.0 billion in 2022. The biomaterials segment covers a large range of bone growth substitutes, including growth factors, cellular allografts, Demineralized Bone Matrices ("DBMs"), traditional allografts, and synthetic bone graft substitutes. Biomaterials are utilized during spine surgery procedures to promote fusion by substituting or augmenting the normal regenerative capacity of bone. 
Our Products
We offer surgical guidance systems, a broad portfolio of spine implants, including solutions for fusion procedures in the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine. We also have a broad portfolio of biomaterial products.
HOLO Portal™
On January 14, 2022, we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") 510(k) clearance for HOLO Portal™, a surgical guidance system utilizing AR and AI for use in spine surgery. HOLO Portal surgical guidance incorporates HOLO™ AI technology with a unique AR interface to enhance intraoperative image-based navigation with AI driven insights. The system features intraoperative surgical planning that uses AI to automate manual and time-consuming 
tasks, such as anatomic labelling, implant sizing, and trajectory planning. The surgical plan is then presented to the surgeon through the augmented reality display.
Patented HOLO Portal software includes several convolutional neural networks to segment and group patient anatomy based on intraoperative CT scans. This results in a patient-specific 3D model that is automatically labeled with anatomic structures for use during surgery, including: pedicle, vertebral body, spinal canal, articular processes, transverse process, lamina, spinous process, ribs, pelvis.
HOLO Portal software suggests screw trajectories and measures pedicle sizes from the patient-specific 3D model. The system then suggests the appropriate screw size based on a surgeon-defined pedicle fill ratio. The resulting surgical plan is designed to maximize accuracy and eliminate time spent manually planning trajectories and measuring screw sizes.
Once the segmentation and screw plans are generated, HOLO Portal software displays the surgical plan intraoperatively through the interactive AR display and provides a 3D guidance overlay on the patient’s anatomy. 3D trajectory and targeting are superimposed on surgical instruments in real time within the surgical field. This innovative design may reduce the surgeon’s cognitive load by providing intuitive guidance that allows the surgeon to keep focus on the surgical field. We believe that HOLO Portal will help surgeons achieve better surgical outcomes, reduce complications, and improve patient satisfaction. 
We are developing additional applications utilizing HOLO AI technology for use in multiple clinical specialties across the patient continuum of care. We believe HOLO AI, our portfolio of neural network technologies, is one of the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies being applied to surgery.
Spine Implants
As of December 31, 2022, all of our revenues related to the spine implants portfolio are generated from spinal fusion devices and motion preservation devices. Fusion devices are designed and developed to aid in the restoration of spinal alignment and to provide fixation during the fusion process. Conversely, motion preservation devices are designed to stabilize the spine and allow for motion of the segments. We provide devices in each of these segments of the spinal hardware implant market. 
Thoracolumbar and Cervical Spine Fusion Devices
We offer a broad portfolio of cervical, thoracic and lumbar interbody (e.g., Fortilink® cages with TETRAfuse® and TiPlus™ technologies) and supplemental fixation (e.g., Streamline® MIS/Degen/OCT pedicle screws and CervAlign® ACDF plating system) devices for conventional spine fusion procedures including anterior cervical ciscectomy and fusion (ACDF), posterior cervical fusion (PCF), posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) and lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF).
Biomaterials
We have a significant portfolio across the biomaterials market for spinal fusion procedures. Our portfolio of biomaterials includes products ranging from innovative tissue-based solutions to advanced synthetic bone graft substitutes for a range of surgical applications. Our biomaterials products complement our spine implants product line with the synergistic goal to improve fusion rates. 
Cellular Allograft
The ViBone® family of products, supplied by Aziyo Biologics, Inc. (“Aziyo”), is a next-generation viable cellular allograft bone matrix processed using a proprietary method optimized to protect and preserve the health of native bone cells to potentially enhance new bone formation.
Demineralized Bone Matrices (DBM)
DBM formulations are designed to provide naturally occurring bone proteins and other growth factors at varying stages of the bone healing process. We offer a broad DBM portfolio, which includes putty, strip, and boat configurations for various surgical applications to provide a natural scaffold for bone ingrowth and osteoinductive potential to facilitate fusion. Our DBM family of products include FibreX™ supplied by Origin Biologics, BiomaX™® supplied by AlloSource, and BioAdapt® supplied by RTI Surgical.
Synthetic Bone Growth Substitutes 
Our synthetic bone growth substitutes portfolio includes the nanOss® family of products, which provide osteoconductive nano-structured HA and an engineered extracellular matrix bioscaffold collagen carrier to provide a natural bone growth solution.
Research and Development
We focus on innovation, quality, and clinical validation in the design and development of our products. Instrumental to this focus is creating a Research and Development (“R&D”) organization centralized in San Diego, California. This center of excellence will continue to be supported by our capabilities in Wurmlingen, Germany. We continue to expand our capabilities in Poland, acquired through the Holo Surgical and INN transactions, that bring us expertise in AR, machine learning, and software development which will help us expand on our digital health strategy. We have also maintained our strategic partnership with RTI Surgical, and Pioneer dba Resolve, subsequent to the disposition of our OEM Businesses, to support our spine implants and biomaterials businesses. 
Aligning Holo Surgical with our acquisition of equity in INN, we are committed to leading in digital health and expanding our scope outside the operating room and in additional clinical specialties. Our priorities include refinement and expansion of indications of our HOLO Portal system, and the development of a cloud platform to allow use of HOLO™ AI technology in preoperative and postoperative settings. We believe this will enable us to leverage HOLO™ AI technology to automate certain use cases in diagnostics, preoperative planning, patient specific implants, and postoperative assessment, with an ultimate goal of predictive patient outcomes. 
Intellectual Property
Our business depends upon the significant know-how and proprietary technology we have developed and curated. To protect this know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of trade secret laws, patents, licenses, trademarks, and confidentiality agreements. The intended effect of these intellectual property rights is to define zones of exclusive use of the covered intellectual property. The duration of patent rights generally is 20 years from the date of filing of priority application, while trademarks, once registered, generally have a term of 10 years but can be renewed so long as the trademarks continue to be used. Our trademarks and service marks provide our company and our products with a certain degree of brand recognition in our markets. However, we do not consider any single patent, trademark or service mark material to our business strategy, financial condition, or results of operations. Further, we have also entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. 
Our U.S. and foreign holdings include, without limitation, patents, patent applications and trade secrets relating to or covering digital technologies, certain synthetic bone graft substitutes; interbody fusion and motion implants; spinal and orthopedic plates; spinal rods, cables and screws and spinal fixation systems and related instrumentation. 
As of December 31, 2022, the intellectual property of the Holo Surgical business included, among other things, five issued U.S. patents, two granted European patents, twelve U.S. pending patent applications, ten pending European patent applications, and two pending PCT patent applications. We do not know whether our current patent applications, or any future patent applications that we may file, will result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, or at all, or whether any patents we may receive will be challenged or invalidated. The expected years of expiration for these patents and any patents that issue from such pending applications range from 2037 to 2042. The HOLO platform is intended to be an autonomous anatomical mapping technology that helps surgeons and physicians diagnose, treat, and manage patients with neurosurgical and orthopedic conditions. The HOLO™ platform is designed to be capable of advanced, real-time analytics, autonomous presurgical planning, and autonomous intraoperative guidance, potentially enhancing surgical performance with the goal of facilitating improved patient outcomes.
Further, as part of the acquisition of the equity interest in INN, we received a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to INN intellectual property and proprietary artificial intelligence technology and intercranial capabilities complement our HOLO platform technology.
The medical device and software technology industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, can be expensive, and its outcome is uncertain. As the number of entrants into our market increases, the risk of an infringement claim against us, as well as the risk of a third party infringing on our patents, grows. While we attempt to ensure that our implants and methods do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, our competitors or other third parties may assert that our implants, and the methods we employ, are covered by patents held by 
them. In addition, our competitors and other third parties may assert that future implants and methods we may employ infringe their patents. If third parties claim that we infringe upon, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected implant. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation will be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We are currently, have been in the past, and may be in the future, involved in litigation relating to intellectual property. For more information regarding the risks related to intellectual property, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Sales and Distribution
We currently market and sell our products in the United States and in approximately 40 countries globally. Our U.S. Commercial organization includes Professional Education, Corporate Accounts, and field-based Area Sales Directors and Regional Product Specialists supported by an extensive network of independent spine and biomaterial distributors. Our international sales organization consists of a direct sales force in several European countries and stocking distributors in the rest of the world.
In January 2022 we began hiring our capital sales team which is solely focused on sales and placement of the HOLO Portal system with our strategy partners. This team continues to grow as we continue to place more units in the field. 
Surgeon Education and Training 
We devote significant resources to educate surgeons on the proper use of our technologies and techniques including the HOLO Portal system. The successful use of our products and technologies depends, in part, on the training and skills of the surgeon performing the procedure. We are developing a state-of-the-art cadaver operating theater and training facility in our San Diego Innovation Center, to help drive adoption of our products. 
We believe our success is partially dependent on our ability to differentiate, with clinically validated products and procedures, the quality of our products and reputation within the spine surgeon community. We have a strong commitment to conducting collaborative research with surgeons and we intend to continue working with surgeons and other healthcare professionals in clinical research to further advance our pipeline of novel, innovative technology, and product offerings.
International Operations
Internationally, we market and distribute our implants through a direct distribution organization and a network of independent distributors. International revenues accounted for approximately 16% of our 2022 global revenues. 
Our international business is based in Wurmlingen, Germany. With our presence in the region, we can rely on the large local network of spine manufacturers and the wider “Medical Valley Community” of spine and medical device experts and talent. Our international warehousing and logistics have been outsourced to a qualified third-party logistics provider based in the Netherlands that has scalable biomaterials and hardware capabilities and operations. We received Medical Device Regulations (“MDR”) certification in the EU in October 2020, which we believe will provide us opportunities for future expansion. 
A significant addition to our international presence is the acquisition of Holo Surgical and INN personnel in Poland which we project will allow us to harness new capabilities in digital surgery with artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. 
Competition
Competition in the medical implant and medical technology industry is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. Companies within the medical implant industry compete based on design of related instrumentation, efficacy of implants, service and relationships with the surgical community, depth of range of implants, scientific and clinical results, and pricing. In the medical software technology industry, companies compete based on design of technology, enhancements to procedures, and the ability to improve patient outcomes. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, with much greater resources. In some cases, our customers compete with us in multiple product categories.
We consider our principal competitors in the spine implant and biomaterials, and digital health markets to include Medtronic, Zimmer, plc. DePuy Synthes NuVasive, Inc., Stryker Corporation, Global Medical, Inc., Alphatec Holdings Inc., SeaSpine Holdings Corporation, and Orthofix Medical Inc., Augmedics, Inc., and Brainlab AG. 
Government Regulation and Corporate Compliance
Government Regulation
Government regulation plays a significant role in the design and distribution of allograft tissue implants and medical devices. We distribute, where applicable and market our allograft tissue implants and medical devices worldwide. Although some standardization exists, each country in which we do business has its own specific regulatory requirements. These requirements are dynamic in nature and, as such, are continually changing. New regulations may be promulgated at any time and with limited notice. While we believe that we are in material compliance with all existing pertinent international and domestic laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in governmental administrations and regulations, or their interpretation or application, will not adversely affect our operations. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, inability to market current products, criminal prosecution, and/or refusal of the government to authorize the marketing of new products.
We currently market and distribute allograft implants that are processed from human tissue, which are processed by third-party suppliers who are responsible for satisfying local regulatory requirements. We believe that worldwide regulation of allografts is likely to intensify as the international regulatory community focuses on the growing demand for these implants and the attendant safety and efficacy issues of citizen recipients. 
Our research, development, and clinical programs, as well as our marketing and commercial operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our implants distributed in the United States are subject to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our implants and facilities vary widely based on implant type and classification both in the United States, and from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities also differs from country to country. 
Unless an exemption applies, most of the medical devices that we commercially distribute in the United States are covered by premarket notification (“510(k)”) clearance from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II. Manufacturers of most Class II medical devices are required to obtain 510(k) clearance prior to marketing their devices. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to another legally marketed 510(k)-cleared “predicate device.” By regulation, the FDA’s performance goals are to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 FDA review days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance may take longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a lengthy FDA Premarket Approval Application (“PMA”) process. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval through the PMA process. 
Class III medical devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will typically conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (21 CFR Part 820) (“QSR”). FDA reviews of PMA applications generally can take between one and three years, or longer. We do not currently have any FDA PMA approved devices.
The medical devices that we develop, manufacture, distribute, and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to develop and market a medical device, particularly with the new MDR regulations in Europe, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at 
all. While we believe that we have obtained, or will be able to obtain, all necessary clearances and approvals for the manufacture and sale of our implants and that they are, or will be, in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance. After an implant is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements may include, as applicable: product listing and establishment registration; QSRs, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; labeling regulations (including unique device identification (“UDI”) requirements), and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses or indications; clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals.
We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with FDA’s QSR and other regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities outside the United States have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The EU has nationally transposed regulations based on the European Commission (“EC”) Medical Device Directives (“MDD”) for the control of medical devices with which manufacturers must comply. New Medical Device Regulations (“MDR”) were slated to replace the medical device directives effective May 26, 2020, in the EU. However, due to delays, implementation of the EU MDR began on May 26, 2021. Manufacturers must have received Conformitè Europèene (“CE”) certification from a “notified body” to be able to sell products within the member states of the EU. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a CE mark. Products covered by the EC directives that do not bear the CE mark cannot be sold or distributed within the EU. All products that we distribute in the EU have received CE certification. 
All medical devices currently distributed in the EU under MDD are likely impacted by the implementation of MDR. MDR may also include products, such as human tissue, not traditionally considered medical devices in the EU. Additionally, MDR, among other things, increases regulatory requirements for several medical device groupings applicable to our implants distributed in the EU, including strengthening notified body oversight for Class I reusable surgical instruments, and up-classifying spinal devices in contact with the spinal column. We received the initial MDR certification for our Quality Management System in October 2020 which is reviewed for recertification on an annual basis.
Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payers, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policy holder’s healthcare insurance benefits are limited. Also, third-party payers may challenge the medical necessity and prices paid for our products and services.
The False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, as well as state and international anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation, regulate the conduct of medical device companies’ interactions with the healthcare industry. Among other things, these laws and others generally: (1) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, (including Medicare and Medicaid); (2) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; and (3) prohibit inappropriate payment to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We maintain a compliance program that incorporates the seven fundamental elements as set forth by the Office of the Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This facilitates our compliance with requirements regarding the prohibition of inappropriate transfers of value in 
exchange for referrals or obtaining or retaining foreign business engagements, prohibition regarding the submission of inappropriate claims for reimbursement to federal healthcare programs, as well as generally ensuring ethical interactions with the healthcare industry both domestically and internationally.
Under Section 6002 of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act) and similar state and international transparency reporting legislation, we are required to collect and report data regarding payments or other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and other persons in the healthcare industry. Our compliance program ensures all such payments and transfers of value are appropriate per the requirements of applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation and that all required data is reported to relevant U.S. and International governmental entities as called for by applicable transparency reporting legislation. 
In addition, U.S. federal, state, and international laws protect the confidentiality of certain health and other personal information, in particular individually identifiable information such as medical records and other protected health information (“PHI”), and restrict the use and disclosure of such information. In administering our employee health plan, we comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). In our dealing with customers such as health care providers or hospitals, we are not a Covered Entity or Business Associate as defined by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but we voluntarily incorporate applicable HIPAA standards in our corporate policies regarding handling of PHI we receive. We are also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act. At the international level, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (“GDPR”) applies to our processing of personal data of EU residents. This law regulates and protects the collection, use, processing, and disclosure of personal information, including by imposing privacy and security requirements and penalties for violations. We comply with this regulation for both general personal data as well as the higher sensitivity standards for health and financial data and are implementing the standards of this regulation as part of our corporate policy for processing personal data from all U.S. and international jurisdictions. 
Corporate Compliance
We have a comprehensive compliance program. It is a fundamental policy of our company to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. Our corporate compliance and ethics program is designed to promote legal compliance and ethical business practices throughout our domestic and international businesses. 
Our compliance program is designed to substantially meet the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s guidelines for effective organizational compliance and ethics programs and to detect and prevent violations of applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Our compliance program is global in nature; designed and operationalized to ensure compliance with relevant international laws and multi-jurisdictional legislation, including, but not limited to: OFAC, FCPA, UK Bribery Act, Modern Slavery, HIPAA and GDPR. 
Key elements of our compliance program include:
•Organizational oversight by senior-level personnel responsible for the compliance functions within our company; 
•Written standards and procedures, including a Code of Conduct; 
•Methods for communicating compliance concerns, including anonymous reporting mechanisms; 
•Investigation and remediation measures to ensure prompt response to reported matters and timely corrective action;

•Auditing and monitoring controls to promote compliance with applicable laws and assess program effectiveness; 
•Oversight of interactions with healthcare professionals to ensure compliance with healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including mandated reporting of transfers of value to healthcare professionals under the Affordable Care Act; 
•Oversight of corporate handling of personal data to ensure compliance with data protection legislation; 
•Disciplinary guidelines to enforce compliance and address violations; 
•Screening of employees and relevant contracted business associates; and 
•Risk assessments to identify areas of regulatory compliance risk. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 263 employees, of which 217 were full-time employees and 111 were employed outside of the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our 
employee relations to be good. We believe a strong employee culture and a commitment to improving patient lives by advancing the standard of spine care and our digital health initiatives will help foster a shared sense of engagement and purpose among our employees and provide us with a competitive advantage. Our culture and employees are driven by our five values: being relentless, gritty and tenacious; acting with speed; being customer-focused and patient-minded; leading with integrity; and being bold and acting courageously. We intend to attract and retain the best talent in the industry by offering competitive pay, annual incentive awards, equity opportunities, health, wellness and retirement benefits, and a work environment that enables our employees to fully utilize their potential and deliver long-term stockholder value. We also believe having a diverse workforce, including diversity of personal characteristics and experience, is important for us to succeed as we transform our legacy business into Surgalign: a leading medical technology company focused on elevating the standard of care through the evolution of digital health.
Seasonality
Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopedic implant surgeries and elective procedures generally declines during the summer months and increases in the fourth quarter.
