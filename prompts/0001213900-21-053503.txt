ITEM 1. BUSINESS



Reference herein to the “Company,” “PME,” “we,” “our” or “us,” means Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd. and includes its subsidiaries, unless the contest requires otherwise.



Our Business



We are a marine enterprise group primarily engaging in ocean fishing through our operating subsidiary, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd., or Pingtan Fishing, which is organized in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). We carry out marine fishing operations in the international waters and the approved waters in access fishing countries with many of our owned vessels or licensed vessels for which we have exclusive operating license rights. We provide high quality seafood to a diverse group of customers including distributors, restaurant owners and exporters in the PRC.



We initially had a fishing fleet of 40 vessels in 2013. By June 2015, we expanded the number of vessels to 135 through the construction of 3 new vessels, the purchase of 72 licensed vessels and the acquisition of 20-year exclusive operating rights to 20 vessels. Our fishing fleet consists of vessels of diversified fishing methods, including trawling, drift netting, light luring seine, long line fishing and squid jigging.



From 2017 to 2018, we purchased 2 refrigerated transport vessels and 4 squid jigging vessels. Of those vessels, the renovation of 2 transport vessels and 2 squid jigging vessels were completed in subsequent years and were deployed to international waters. The ownership transfer of the remaining 2 vessels’ is not yet completed, but the Company is entitled to 100% of the operations and net profits (losses) from the vessels. 



In April 2018, 27 vessels received approval from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the PRC (“MARA”) to operate in international waters after the completion of modification and rebuilding projects. The 27 fishing vessels were modified and rebuilt into 20 squid jigging vessels and 7 light luring seine vessels and have been deployed for operation in late 2018 and early 2019.



In 2019, the Company had 30 fishing vessels that received approval from the MARA to operate in international waters after completion of modification and rebuilding. The 30 vessels were rebuilt and modified into 15 squid jigging vessels and 15 seine vessels. The renovation of the 30 vessels was completed in 2019 and these vessels were deployed to international waters for operation.

In 2020, the Company had 11 fishing vessels that received approval from the MARA to operate in international waters after completion of modification and rebuilding. The 11 vessels were rebuilt and modified into 10 squid jigging vessels and 1 refrigerated transport vessel. The renovation of the 11 vessels was completed in 2020 and these vessels were deployed to international waters for operation.



In 2020, 20 more vessels also received approval from MARA to operate in international waters after the completion of modification and rebuilding projects. The 20 vessels were going to be modified and rebuilt into 20 seine vessels.



As of December 31, 2020, we owned 51 squid jigging vessels, 26 trawlers, 25 seine vessels, 13 drifters, 4 longline fishing vessels, and 3 transport vessels and had exclusive operating license rights to 20 seine vessels. Additionally, 1 new krill fishing vessel was in the building stage.



Among the 143 vessels, 80 were located in international waters, 12 were located in the Bay of Bengal in India, 13 were located in the PRC, 37 were located in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia and 1 new krill fishing vessel was in the building stage. In the fourth quarter of 2020, 37 vessels in Indonesian waters, 13 vessels in PRC and 1 krill fishing vessel were impaired in the amount of $66,694,253 resulting in a net carrying value, after impairment, of $1,380,329 as of December 31, 2020. See Note 2 for discussion of Impairment of long-lived assets. 



We catch nearly 30 different species of fish, including squid, ribbon fish, croaker fish and cuttle fish. All of our catch is shipped back to the PRC. We arrange chartered transportation ships to deliver frozen stocks to cold storage warehouses located in one of the PRC’s largest seafood trading centers, the Mawei Seafood Market in Fujian Province.



We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of frozen seafood products. We sell our products directly to customers, including seafood processors, distributors, restaurant owners and exporters. Most of our customers have long-term, cooperative relationships with us. Our existing customers also introduce new customers to us from time to time. In July 2017, we started strategic cooperation with e-commerce platform to sell our fish products directly to consumers online. Based on past experiences, demand for seafood products is the highest from December to January, during the Chinese New Year. We believe that our profitability and growth are dependent on our ability to deploy our vessels to new fishing grounds and our ability to expand our customer base.

Government Permits and Approvals



We are required to go through a series of procedures to obtain all approvals necessary to fish in the designated fishing areas.



Step one: Obtaining Vessel Building Permits



First, we have to file a vessel building application to the relevant governmental authorities in Fujian to obtain the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits. Governmental authorities in Fujian verify Pingtan Fishing’s qualifications for pelagic fishing and pass on the verified and approved application documents to affiliates of the MARA for further confirmation. Once confirmed, the certificates are issued to Pingtan Fishing.
Step two: Vessels Building and Inspection



After obtaining the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits, we start building the new vessels through contracting with third party vessel manufacturers. During the period of construction, inspection of the vessels is performed several times by the relevant governmental authorities. Once the construction is completed, a Vessel Inspection Certificate is issued, after which we can apply for certificates of ownership and certificates of nationality for new vessels.
Step three: Fishing Project Application



Each vessel is required to be licensed by the MARA and, to the extent required, the vessel may also be required to obtain a license from the local government where the vessel conducts fishing operations. For example, in order to conduct fishing operations in the exclusive economic zone of other countries, foreign fishing vessels need to obtain the approval from each of the local departments of fisheries of those other countries. After obtaining all certificates in step two, we file applications to the relevant governmental authorities to obtain approvals for pelagic fishing projects in the specified fishing areas. Meanwhile, we start the application process for obtaining fishing permits from the relevant governmental authorities in the applicable fishing destination countries. In some countries, the Company may be required to obtain licenses through local entities, which are required to also possess a fishery business license.
Step four: Preparations Before Departure



Once the approval for pelagic fishing projects areissued, we can complete all relevant departure procedures within six months from the time the notification of approval is issued. Departure procedures include obtaining visas for fishing vessels and crew members, submitting required certificates to the PRC customs in Fujian, and obtaining other relevant documents from governmental authorities, such as Vessel Departure Certificates.
Step five: Fishing Project Approval and Departure to Fishing Areas



After we have submitted all required documents to the relevant governmental authorities and completed all procedures required for departure, we receive confirmation of pelagic fishing project approval from affiliates of the MARA. Once we obtain such confirmation, our vessels can depart to the applicable fishing destination country. Fish caught at the destination may then be shipped back and be declared at PRC customs.

Operations



Harvesting Operations



The fishing vessels can carry up to one-month of supplies. The captains of the vessels utilize sophisticated technology to identify, among other things, fishing areas, time to cast and draw in the nets, vessel speed and sailing direction allowing the vessels to optimize the catch and resource value. Nearby fishing groups share real-time fishing information through wireless radio equipment. The catch is separated based on species and sizes and is frozen immediately. Once the storage of a fishing vessel is at capacity, the catch is shipped to our cold storage facility located in Mawei.
Seasonality



In most waters where our vessels operate, autumn and winter are the seasons when harvest is most productive and summer is relatively a low season. In addition, our annual catches are affected by a number of unpredictable factors, such as weather patterns and fish migration, which are likely to vary from year to year.
Cold Storage



Fish are stored separately according to different species and sizes for best practices of cold storage management, goods selectivity and delivery.



We have secured several cold storages facilities located in one of the PRC’s largest seafood trading centers, the MaWei seafood market. The monthly rent for cold storage is from RMB70 (US$10) to RMB55 (US$8) per square meter and the leases are renewable annually. The following table sets forth information regarding the cold storages facilities we currently rent as of December 31, 2020:

 | Monthly |

Sales, Marketing and Distribution



We market, sell and distribute products all over China, including the Fujian, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces. Squid, peru squid and chub mackerel were the main types of seafood sold for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 63.2% of our sales.



As of December 31, 2020, we sold our fish to over 60 distributors and retailers by acting as a wholesaler. We serve a wide customer base and four customers accounted for more than 10% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Vessels



As of December 31, 2020, we owned 51 squid jigging vessels, 26 trawlers, 25 seine vessels, 13 drifters, 4 longline fishing vessels, and 3 transport vessels and had exclusive operating license rights to 20 seine vessels. Additionally, 1 new krill fishing vessel was in the building stage. 



Among the 143 vessels, 80 were located in international waters, 12 were located in the Bay of Bengal in India, 13 were located in the PRC waters, 37 were located in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia and 1 new krill fishing vessel was in the building stage. In the fourth quarter of 2020, 37 vessels in Indonesian waters, 13 vessels in PRC and 1 krill fishing vessel were impaired in the amount of $66,694,253 resulting in a net carrying value, after impairment, of $1,380,329 as of December 31, 2020. See Note 2 for discussion of Impairment of long-lived assets. 


Business Strategy



We are committed to developing our business to become a global, integrated seafood company. We plan to enlarge our fishing fleet in the next few years through organic growth and acquisition opportunities of potential targets, domestically and abroad.



We are actively seeking opportunities to expand to other fishing grounds worldwide including North America, South America and the high seas, which will further diversify the fish types we harvest. We are also planning to expand our operations to fish processing and trading businesses.



Competition



As vessels with access to the pelagic fishing operations are restricted to a limited number, we believe that competition within our designated fishing areas is not significant.



Competition in the consumer market in China is high as fish compete with other sources of protein. We also compete with other fishing companies which offer similar and varied products. There is significant demand for fish in the Chinese market. Our catch appeals to a wide segment of consumers because of the low-price points of our products. We have generally been able to sell our catch at market prices.

Human Capital Resources



As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,998 employees. The following table sets forth the number of employees by function as of December 31, 2020:




 | Number of Employees | | % of Total
------------------------------------+-------------------------+-------+-----------
Management and administrative staff | | 55 | | 2.8 | %
Crew members | | 1,943 | | 97.2 | %
Total | | 1,998 | | 100.0 | %




We believe that the success of a business is largely due to the quality of its employees and the development of each employee’s full potential. We encourage and support the development of our employees and, whenever possible, strive to fill vacancies from within. Accordingly, we strive to offer competitive salaries and employee benefits to all employees and monitor salaries in our market areas. In addition to competitive base salaries and benefits, additional employee programs include paid time off, birthday gifts, benefits and gifts on International Women’s Day. We maintain a comprehensive training and development program for all of our crew members. Our program emphasizes, among other things, operating procedures and safety guides.



Throughout the course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have been providing masks, sanitizers and applying contactless procedures to support the health and safety of our employees.



In 2020, we contracted six third-party labor companies to provide crew labor dispatching services. We pay the hiring costs based on the actual fees incurred on a monthly basis. Welfare and benefit payments for such personnel are covered by the companies supplying the crew members.



Company History



China Equity Growth Investment Ltd. (“CGEI”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted limited liability company and a blank check company on January 18, 2010 and changed its name to Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd. in February 2013.



China Dredging Group Co., Ltd (“CDGC” or “China Dredging”) and Merchant Supreme Co., Ltd (“Merchant Supreme”) are limited liability companies incorporated on April 14, 2010 and June 25, 2012, respectively, in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”).



China Dredging, through its PRC Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), Fujian Xinggang Port Service Co., Ltd (“Fujian Service”), provided specialized dredging services exclusively to the PRC marine infrastructure market and was, based on the number and capacity of the dredging vessels it operated, one of the leading independent (not state-owned) providers of such services in the PRC.



Merchant Supreme, through its PRC VIE, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd. (“Pingtan Fishing”) engages in ocean fishery with its fleet of self-owned vessels and vessels with exclusive operating license rights within the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”) and Arafura Sea of Indonesia.



CGEI and CDGC entered into the Merger Agreement dated October 24, 2012, providing for the combination of CGEI and CDGC. CGEI also acquired all of the outstanding capital shares and other equity interests of Merchant Supreme as per the Share Purchase Agreement dated October 24, 2012. Following the completion of the business combination on February 25, 2013, CDGC and Merchant Supreme became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “Business Combination”). The ordinary shares of the Company, par value $0.001 per share were listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “PME”.

In order to place increased focus on the fishing business and pursue more effective growth opportunities, we decided to exit and sell the specialized dredging services operated by China Dredging, and we completed the sale of CDGC and its subsidiaries on December 4, 2013.



On February 9, 2015, the Company terminated its existing Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) agreements, pursuant to an Agreement of Termination dated February 9, 2015, entered into by and among Ms. Honghong Zhuo, Mr. Zhiyan Lin (each a shareholder of Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd (“Pingtan Fishing”), and together the “Pingtan Fishing’s Shareholders”), Pingtan Fishing and Pingtan Guansheng Ocean Fishing Co., Ltd. (“Pingtan Guansheng”). On February 9, 2015, the Pingtan Fishing’s Shareholders transferred 100% of their equity interest in Pingtan Fishing to Fujian Heyue Marine Fishing Development Co., Ltd. (“Fujian Heyue”), pursuant to an Equity Transfer Agreement dated February 9, 2015, entered into by and among the Pingtan Fishing’s Shareholders, Pingtan Fishing and Fujian Heyue. On February 15, 2015, China Agriculture Industry Development Fund Co., Ltd. (“China Agriculture”) invested Chinese Renmibi (“RMB”) 400 million (approximately $65 million) into Pingtan Fishing for an 8% equity interest in Pingtan Fishing. After the restructuring transactions described above, Pingtan Fishing and its entities became the 92% equity-owned subsidiaries of the Company and was no longer a VIE.
