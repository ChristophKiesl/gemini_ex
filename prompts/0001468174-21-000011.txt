Overview 
Hyatt Hotels Corporation is a global hospitality company with widely recognized, industry-leading brands and a tradition of innovation developed over our more than sixty-year history. In 2004, substantially all of the hospitality assets owned by Pritzker family business interests, including Hyatt Corporation and Hyatt International Corporation, were consolidated under a single entity whose name was subsequently changed to Global Hyatt Corporation. In 2009, Global Hyatt Corporation changed its name to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, and we completed our initial public offering ("IPO") of our Class A common stock. 
We operate, manage, franchise, own, lease, develop, license, or provide services to a portfolio of properties, consisting of full service hotels, select service hotels, resorts, and other properties, including timeshare, fractional, and other forms of residential, vacation, and condominium ownership units. At December 31, 2020, our hotel portfolio consisted of 974 hotels (235,272 rooms). See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview" for a categorized breakdown of our portfolio. Our colleagues and hotel general managers are supported by our regional management teams, located in cities around the world, and our executive management team, headquartered in Chicago.
Our thirteen full service brands are: Park Hyatt, Miraval, Grand Hyatt, Alila, Andaz, The Unbound Collection by Hyatt, Destination, Hyatt Regency, Hyatt, Thompson Hotels, Hyatt Centric, Joie de Vivre, and tommie. Our select service brands are Caption by Hyatt, Hyatt House, and Hyatt Place. In addition, we participate in an unconsolidated hospitality venture with a Chinese hospitality company that owns the UrCove select service brand serving the upper-midscale market in Greater China. Our all-inclusive resort brands are Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara. We also manage, provide services to, or license our trademarks with respect to residential ownership units that are often adjacent to a Hyatt-branded full service hotel. We consult with third parties in the design and development of such mixed-use projects. We license certain of our trademarks with respect to vacation ownership units, which are part of Hyatt Residence Club. Additionally, we provide services and, in some cases, manage the rental programs and/or homeowner associations associated with condominium ownership units.
We primarily derive our revenues from owned and leased hotel operations, management of hotels, and licensing of our portfolio of brands to franchisees. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues totaled $2.1 billion, net loss attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation totaled $703 million, and Adjusted EBITDA totaled $(177) million. See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management—Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") and EBITDA" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present it, and for a reconciliation of our net income (loss) attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented. 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The global spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are complex and continuously evolving, resulting in significant disruption to our business, the lodging and hospitality industries, and the global economy. The pandemic has led governments and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on large gatherings of people, travel bans, border closings, business closures and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing measures. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have significantly reduced global travel and demand for hotel rooms and travel experiences, and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity across the travel, lodging, and hospitality industries, which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Our Purpose, Vision, Mission, and Values 
Our Purpose 
We care for people so they can be their best. 
Our Vision 
A world of understanding and care.
Our Mission 
We deliver distinctive experiences for our guests. 
Our Values
Respect, integrity, humility, empathy, creativity, and fun. 
Our purpose, vision, mission, and values are brought to life by our colleagues, whom we refer to as the Hyatt family. We believe our colleagues around the world embody our purpose of caring for people, including one another, our guests and customers, property owners, and the communities in which our hotels operate. We are strongly committed to advancing care for all of our stakeholders and creating personal connections to increase loyalty and drive results. High levels of guest satisfaction lead to increased guest preference for our brands, which we believe results in a strengthened revenue base over the long term. We also believe engaged colleagues will enhance efficient operation of our properties, resulting in improved financial results. Sustained adherence to these principles is a basis for our brand reputation and strongly contributes to our growth as our diverse group of owners and developers choose to invest in our portfolio of properties around the world.
Our Competitive Strengths 
We have significant competitive strengths that support our mission to deliver distinctive experiences for our guests and drive growth and create value for our customers, colleagues, and shareholders.
    World Class Brands.    Inspired by a deep understanding of guest needs, we have developed, and in some cases acquired, a global suite of distinct brands.
    Global Platform with Compelling Growth Potential.    Our existing global presence is widely distributed, and our hotels operate in some of the most populous urban centers around the globe, and we believe our existing hotels, located in key markets around the globe, provide us with a strong platform from which to selectively pursue new growth opportunities in markets where our brands are less prevalent.
    Deep Culture and Experienced Management Teams.    The Hyatt family is united by shared values, a single purpose, and a deep commitment to listening, understanding, and personalizing experiences for our guests and customers – all of which we believe increases loyalty, differentiates us from the competition, and drives business results. 
    Strong Capital Base and Disciplined Financial Approach.    Our approach is to maintain appropriate levels of financial leverage through industry cycles and downturns. Current economic conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted our earnings, cash flow from operations, and leverage levels. As a result, we accessed debt capital markets to enhance our liquidity in order to support operations until demand returns and cash flow improves. At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.9 billion and available borrowing capacity of approximately $1.5 billion. We believe our balance sheet strength uniquely positions us to successfully navigate the current economic environment and to take advantage of strategic opportunities to expand our presence and grow our business over time. 
    Diverse Exposure to Hotel Management, Franchising, Ownership, and Development.    Our mix of managed, franchised, owned, and leased properties provides a broad and diverse base of revenues, profits, and cash flows and gives us flexibility to evaluate growth opportunities across our lines of business. 
    High-Quality Owned Hotels are Located in Desirable Markets and are a Source of Capital for New Growth Investments.    We believe our owned assets provide us the opportunity to unlock additional shareholder value through targeted dispositions that provide cash proceeds to fund additional strategic investments to expand our presence or provide incremental return of capital to shareholders. In 2018, we realized $1.5 billion of proceeds from the disposition of owned assets, completing our initial sell-down commitment. In March 2019, we committed to an additional $1.5 billion reduction of our owned real estate portfolio over a three-year period, and at December 31, 2020, we have realized proceeds of approximately $1 billion under this commitment. 
Our Business Strategy 
Despite the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the hospitality industry, we remain committed to our long-term strategy. Our strategy to drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for guests, customers, colleagues, owners, and shareholders is focused on the following areas:
•Maximize Our Core Business: We continue to grow and operate our core business with excellence in order to be best-in-class while aiming to generate profits to fuel our growth. 
•Integrate New Growth Platforms: We seek to identify and integrate new opportunities to advance care for our guests and provide additional paths for growth. 
•Optimize Capital Deployment: We take a comprehensive and disciplined approach to our deployment of capital to expand our management and franchising business, invest in new growth platforms, and return capital to our shareholders.

Business Segment, Revenues, and Geographical Information 
We manage our business within four reportable segments as described below:
•Owned and leased hotels, which consists of our owned and leased full service and select service hotels and, for purposes of segment Adjusted EBITDA, our pro rata share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures, based on our ownership percentage of each venture;
•Americas management and franchising ("Americas"), which consists of our management and franchising of properties located in the United States, Latin America, Canada, and the Caribbean, as well as our residential management operations;
•ASPAC management and franchising ("ASPAC"), which consists of our management and franchising of properties located in Southeast Asia, Greater China, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, and Micronesia; and 
•EAME/SW Asia management and franchising ("EAME/SW Asia"), which consists of our management and franchising of properties located in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India, Central Asia, and Nepal.
Within corporate and other, we include the results from our co-branded credit card program, the results of the Exhale spa and fitness business, which was sold in December 2020, and unallocated corporate expenses. Effective January 1, 2020, we changed the strategic and operational oversight for our Miraval properties, which were previously evaluated as a distinct business by our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The management fees from Miraval properties are now reported in the Americas management and franchising segment, and the operating results and financial position of underlying hotel results are now reported in our owned and leased hotels segment; the results of Miraval properties were previously reported in corporate and other. In addition, the license fees we receive from Hyatt Residence Club are now reported within our Americas management and franchising segment due to changes in the strategic oversight for these license agreements. For information regarding our four reportable business segments, revenues, and geographical information, see Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule—Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements." 
Management Agreements 
We manage hotels worldwide pursuant to management agreements.
Hotel Management Agreements Fees 
Our hotel management agreements typically provide for a two-tiered fee structure that compensates us both for the volume of business we generate for the property as well as for the profitability of hotel operations. In these two-tier fee structures, our base compensation is a base fee that is usually an agreed-upon percentage of gross revenues from hotel operations. In addition, we are incentivized to improve hotel profitability through an incentive fee that is typically calculated as a percentage of a hotel profitability measure, such as gross operating profit, adjusted profit, or the amount by which gross operating profit or adjusted profit exceeds a specified threshold. Outside of the United States, some management agreements have fees more dependent on hotel profitability measures either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure or because our two-tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee. 
Hotel Management Agreements Terms and Renewals 
The approximate average remaining term of our hotel management agreements with third-party owners and unconsolidated hospitality ventures for full service hotels and select service hotels (other than those currently under development) is as follows:

 | Assuming no renewal options are exercised by either party: | Including exercise of extension options that are in Hyatt's sole discretion:
Full service management agreements: | | 
Americas | 13 years | 18 years 
EAME/SW Asia | 16 years | 20 years 
ASPAC | 14 years | 15 years 
Select service management agreements: | | 
Americas | 12 years | 28 years 
EAME/SW Asia | 19 years | 33 years 
ASPAC | 18 years | 19 years 

Some of our hotel management agreements grant early termination rights to hotel owners upon the occurrence of a stated event, such as the sale of the hotel or our failure to meet a specified performance test (any such event a "termination event"). In the case of a termination event, some of our management agreements grant hotel owners the right to terminate the hotel management agreement and convert the hotel to a Hyatt franchise. Generally, termination rights under performance tests are based upon the property's individual performance or its performance when compared to a specified set of competitive hotels branded by other hotel operators or both. These termination rights are usually triggered if we do not meet the performance tests over multiple years. We generally have the option to cure performance failures by paying an amount equal to the shortfall, but in some cases our cure rights may be limited, and our failure to meet a performance test may result in the termination of our hotel management agreement. Certain of our management agreements allow for a termination right after a multi-year lock-out period and are subject to a termination fee generally based upon a formula related to the lost fees.
Many of our hotel management agreements, particularly in the United States, are subordinated to mortgages or other secured indebtedness of the owners. In most cases, our subordination agreements with lenders recognize our right to continue to manage the hotels under the terms set forth in the hotel management agreements if the lenders take possession of the hotel property through foreclosure or similar means.
Franchise Agreements 
Our franchise agreements grant our franchisees the limited right to use our name, marks, and system in the operation of franchised Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Regency, Hyatt, Hyatt Ziva, Hyatt Zilara, Thompson Hotels, Hyatt Centric, Caption by Hyatt, Hyatt House, and Hyatt Place properties, and franchised properties operated under distinct tradenames and affiliated with The Unbound Collection by Hyatt, Destination Hotels, and Joie de Vivre. We do not participate in the management of our franchised hotels; however, franchisees are required to operate franchised hotels consistent with our brand standards. We approve the plans for, and the location of, franchised hotels and review the operation of these hotels to ensure our standards are maintained.
Fees
In general, our franchisees pay us an initial application fee and/or a design services fee as well as ongoing royalty fees, the amount of which depends on the brand under which the franchised property is licensed. We franchise full service hotels under the Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Regency, Hyatt, Thompson Hotels, and Hyatt Centric brands, all-inclusive resorts under the Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara brands, and full service hotels under distinct tradenames and affiliated with The Unbound Collection by Hyatt, Destination Hotels, and Joie de Vivre brands. We franchise select service hotels under the Caption by Hyatt, Hyatt House, and Hyatt Place brands. Our Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Regency, Hyatt, and Thompson Hotels franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as 6% of gross room revenues and 3% of gross food and beverage revenues. Our Hyatt Centric franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as 5% of gross room revenues. The Unbound Collection by Hyatt, Destination Hotels, and Joie de Vivre franchisees typically pay us continuing franchise fees calculated as 7% of gross room revenues generated through Hyatt reservation and booking channels. In some cases, typically for new hotel development 
franchise agreements, our full service continuing franchise fees begin at a lower percentage than listed above and escalate in the initial few years of the term. Caption by Hyatt, Hyatt House, and Hyatt Place franchisees, typically for new hotel development franchise agreements, pay continuing franchise fees calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues, which typically are 3% in the first year of operations, 4% in the second year, and 5% through the remainder of the term. Our all-inclusive franchisees typically pay us franchise fees calculated as either 2.75% or 3.25% of gross revenues. Application fees are typically $75,000 plus $500 per guest room in excess of 150 for our Hyatt House and Hyatt Place hotels, $95,000 plus $500 per guest room in excess of 200 for our Caption by Hyatt hotels, the greater of $100,000 or $400 per guest room for our Hyatt Regency and Grand Hyatt hotels, and the greater of $100,000 or $300 per guest room for our other full service hotels and all-inclusive resorts. In some circumstances, we have negotiated other fee arrangements, and in some regions outside of the United States, we typically negotiate alternative application fee arrangements.
In addition to our franchise fees, we charge full service and select service hotels and all-inclusive resort franchisees for certain services arranged and, in most cases, provided by us. These activities may include centralized reservation functions, certain sales functions, technology, national advertising, certain marketing and promotional services, as well as various revenue management services.
Terms and Renewals 
The standard term of our franchise agreements is typically 20 years, with one 10 year renewal option exercisable by the franchisee, assuming the franchisee has complied with franchise agreement requirements and standards. Certain of our franchise agreements have renewal options at Hyatt's option, generally triggered if the franchisee has failed to exercise its renewal option. Certain of our franchise agreements have renewal options upon the mutual agreement of the parties. We have the right to terminate franchise agreements upon specified events of default, including non-payment of fees and non-compliance with brand standards. In the event of early termination for any reason, our franchise agreements typically set forth liquidated damages our franchisees must pay to us upon termination. The bankruptcy of a franchisee or lender foreclosure could result in the termination of the franchise agreement. The average remaining base term of our franchise agreements for our select service and full service hotels in all regions (other than those currently under development) is approximately 16 years, assuming no renewal options are exercised by either party. Including exercise of extension options in Hyatt's sole discretion, the average remaining term of our franchise agreements for our select service hotels and full service hotels in all regions (other than those currently under development) is approximately 17 years. 
Other Service Agreements
We provide services under the Destination Residential Management business pursuant to rental management agreements with individual property owners and/or homeowner associations whereby the property owners and/or homeowner associations participate in our rental program. The agreements typically provide for our receipt of a percentage split of the total gross revenue generated from a property under the rental program, and expenses of the property are paid from such split. The agreement terms are typically one or two years. Additionally, we provide association management services to the various homeowner associations where we manage the properties for a fee.
Sales, Marketing, and Reservations and Global Contact Centers
Sales 
We deploy a global sales team as well as regional sales teams in our Americas, ASPAC, and EAME/SW Asia regions. The global team is responsible for our largest and most significant accounts doing business in all three regions. The regional teams are responsible for large accounts that typically do business within one region, but at multiple hotels within the region. The global and regional sales teams coordinate efforts with the hotel sales teams. The in-house sales colleagues are focused on local and regional business opportunities, as well as securing business generated from our key global and regional accounts. 
Our corporate sales organizations are focused on growing market share with key accounts, identifying new business opportunities, and maximizing our local customer base. Our key accounts consist of major corporations; national, state, and regional associations; specialty market accounts (social, government, military, educational, religious, and fraternal); travel agency and luxury organizations; and a broad and diverse group of individual consumers. Our global and regional sales teams target multiple brands to key customer accounts within these groups. No single customer is material to our business. Our global and regional teams consist of over 125 colleagues at global and regional sales offices around the world, who are focused on group business, corporate and leisure traveler accounts, and travel agencies. 
Sales colleagues at our regional offices and at many of our full service hotels use our proprietary sales tool to manage the group rooms forecast, maintain an inventory of definite and tentative group rooms booked each day, streamline the process of checking guest room availability and rate quotes, and determine meeting room availability. 
We seek to maximize revenues in each hotel we operate through a team of revenue management professionals and also provide revenue management services to franchisees upon request. Our revenue management leaders use a proprietary technology tool to help set appropriate pricing in each hotel. The goal of revenue management is to secure the right customers, on the right date, at the right price. Business opportunities are reviewed and agreed upon by the hotel's management team.
Marketing
We are focused on the high-end traveler, positioning our brands at the top of each segment in which we operate. Our marketing strategy is designed to drive loyalty and community, while meeting the specific business needs of hotel operations. Building and differentiating each of our brands is critical to increasing Hyatt's brand preference. We are focused on targeting the distinct guest segments that each of our brands serves and supporting the needs of the hotels by thorough analysis and application of data and analytics. The World of Hyatt loyalty program and our digital platforms are also key components of building loyalty and driving revenue. The loyalty program focuses on deepening relationships with members, driving repeat stays, guest satisfaction, recognition, and differential services and experiences for our most loyal guests. Our digital platforms are our primary distribution channels providing guests, customers, and members with an efficient source of information about our hotels, distinct brand experiences, and a seamless booking experience. With a combined focus on increasing brand awareness, building a community of loyalists, and enhancing digital engagement, our marketing is aimed at Hyatt becoming the most preferred hospitality brand.
Reservations and Global Contact Centers
We have a proprietary central reservation system that provides a comprehensive view of inventory, while allowing for local management of rates based on demand. Through this system, we are able to allow bookings and subsequent maintenance of bookings by hotels directly, via telephone through our contact centers, by travel agents, by corporate clients, and through digital platforms. 
We have nine global contact centers that service our global guest base 24 hours per day, seven days per week and provide reservation and other services in over 17 languages. While we continue to provide full reservation services via telephone through these global contact centers, we have made significant investments in internet booking capabilities on Hyatt.com and mobile platforms. Additionally, we continue to enhance the services and capabilities of our global contact centers to better align with evolving technology and guest preference.
In addition, some of the rooms at hotels and resorts we manage or franchise are booked through internet travel intermediaries, partners, or online travel service providers. We also engage third-party intermediaries who collect fees by charging our hotels and resorts a commission on room revenues, including travel agencies and meeting and event management companies. 
World of Hyatt Loyalty Program
We operate the World of Hyatt loyalty program for the benefit of our portfolio of properties. The program generates substantial repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points that can be redeemed for hotel nights and other rewards. Inspired by our purpose, World of Hyatt is also about building community and engagement with high-end travelers. Loyalty program members enjoy additional rewards as they reach milestone rewards and advance through the three elite tiers based on qualifying nights or base points in a calendar year.
Members earn points based on their spend at our properties, by transacting with our strategic loyalty alliances (e.g., American Airlines, Lindblad Expeditions, MGM Resorts International, and Small Luxury Hotels of the World), or in connection with spend on the Hyatt co-branded credit card. Loyalty program points can be redeemed at properties across our brands, converted into airline miles with numerous participating airlines, and redeemed with other third parties. 
The loyalty program is primarily funded through contributions from eligible revenues generated from loyalty program members. These funds are applied to reimburse hotels for room nights when members redeem loyalty program points and pay for administrative expenses and marketing initiatives to support the loyalty program. 
At December 31, 2020, the loyalty program had over 25 million members, and during 2020, represented approximately 36% of total room nights system wide.
Competition 
There is intense competition in all areas of the hospitality industry. Competition exists for hotel, resort, and condominium ownership guests; management and franchise agreements; and sales of vacation and branded residential properties. Our principal competitors are other operators of full service, select service, extended stay, all-inclusive, and wellness properties, including other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. We also compete against small chains and independent and local owners and operators. Increasingly, we also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model, such as Alibaba, search engines such as Google, and peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway.
We compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, customer satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, health and cleanliness standards, amenities, quality of accommodations, security, and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. 
We compete for management agreements based primarily on the value and quality of our management services; our brand name recognition and reputation; the level of our management fees; the costs of payroll at managed properties where we are the employer; cost associated with sales, reservations, technology, and marketing services (collectively, "system-wide services"); and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brand name. We compete for franchise agreements based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, the room rate that can be realized, total revenues we can deliver to the properties, and cost associated with our system-wide services. Other competitive factors for management and franchise agreements include relationships with property owners and investors, including institutional owners of multiple properties; marketing support; reservation and e-commerce system capacity and efficiency; and the ability to provide capital that may be necessary to obtain management and franchise agreements. 
The number of branded lodging operators with a global reach and depth of product and offerings similar to us is limited. We believe our strong customer base, prominent brand recognition, strategic property locations, and global development team enable us to compete effectively. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues, profits, or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively, and new distribution channels, alternatives to traditional hotels, and industry consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business." 
Seasonality 
The hospitality industry is typically seasonal in nature, although the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, seasonality patterns of our business. The periods during which our properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location, the customer base served, and potential impacts due to the timing of certain holidays. 
Cyclicality 
The hospitality industry is cyclical and generally follows, on a lagged basis, the overall economy. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms, in occupancy levels, and in rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles. Variability of results through some of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given categories of hotels. In the most recent cycle, the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic drove immediate decreases in demand. Changes in industry demand related to economic conditions, other factors such as those experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic, or in the supply of hotel rooms, or any combination thereof, can result in significant volatility in results for owners, managers, and franchisors of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable. Because of this, in an environment of declining revenues, the rate of decline in earnings will be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. Conversely, in an environment of increasing demand and room rates, the rate of increase in earnings is typically higher than the rate of increase in revenues. 
Intellectual Property
In the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos are very important in the sales and marketing of our hotels, residential, vacation, and condominium ownership properties and services. We have a significant number of trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, and pending registrations and significant resources are expended each year on surveillance, registration, and protection of our trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos, which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and care. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Any failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property could reduce the value of our brand names and harm our business."
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, building and zoning requirements, data privacy, and general business license and permit requirements, in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, manage, franchise, own, lease, develop, license, or provide services to properties. Our ability to develop new hotel properties and to remodel, refurbish, or add to existing properties is also dependent on obtaining permits from local authorities. We are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination for disabilities and other individual characteristics, work permits, and benefit offerings. Federal, state, and provincial laws and regulations require certain registration, disclosure statements, compliance with specific standards of conduct, and other practices with respect to the franchising of hotels. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental agencies in various jurisdictions have issued evolving health and safety-related regulations and orders that affect our operations. Compliance with these various laws and regulations can affect the revenues and profits of properties managed, franchised, licensed, owned, or leased, and of the residential, vacation, and condominium ownership business and could adversely affect our operations or our reputation. We believe our businesses are conducted in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
We manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels. However, with the exception of Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Spa and Casino, third parties manage and operate the casinos. We hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casino located at Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Spa and Casino and employ third-party compliance consultants and service providers. As a result, our business operations at Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Spa and Casino are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Departamento pa Asuntonan di Casino (D.A.C.), the regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in Aruba. 
Human Capital Resources and Corporate Responsibility Commitment
Our purpose – to care for people so they can be their best – is at the heart of how we care for our guests and colleagues. We recognize that Hyatt's success is dependent on the commitment to genuine service and care that our colleagues deliver to our guests and that our colleagues and culture are at the core of our purpose. Therefore, one of our strategic priorities is to cultivate the best people and foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture that prioritizes wellbeing, enables colleagues to reach their fullest potential, and emphasizes development and growth for all colleagues. 
To support our colleague's physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing, we prioritize offerings and opportunities for them to practice self-care, including providing complimentary access to the Headspace meditation and mindfulness mobile application available for colleagues wherever they are, as well as opportunities for continual learning, such as tuition reimbursement and training courses. Our Colleague Wellbeing Council helps evaluate and shape how we can continue to energize and engage colleagues through feedback collected from colleagues around the world.
In addition, we are continuing to develop new work procedures and mandatory trainings in an effort to ensure health and safety for colleagues. For example, daily colleague surveys were introduced in 2020 to measure colleague comfort as well as a property's cleanliness, working order, and customer service, with the goal of enabling property leaders to address opportunities, make adjustments as necessary, and meet the needs of colleagues and guests in real time. 
We believe addressing environmental, social, and governance issues is an essential element of advancing care for all of our stakeholders, including our guests, colleagues, customers, owners, and the communities in which our properties operate around the world. Our global corporate responsibility efforts are focused on fostering environmental stewardship; strengthening our community impact through volunteerism, philanthropy, and disaster relief; and supporting responsible business practices in our operations. 
We have a long history of focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion and we are committed to holding ourselves accountable for continued change holistically across Hyatt's business. Our Change Starts Here commitment that launched in 
June 2020 includes actionable goals to accelerate our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by 2025. These commitments include specific representation goals for women and people of color, and are designed to drive meaningful change and positively impact our workforce, communities, and industry. In addition, we maintain a Global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council, led by our CEO, to shape and drive our diversity and inclusion strategy, and we sponsor seven colleague-led Diversity Business Resource Groups with chapters around the globe to provide career development programs and support workforce diversity. Hyatt colleagues are eager to learn, participate, and impact this space. To address this interest, Hyatt provides a Leading Inclusively training for all people managers at both the corporate and hotel-level. This training provides an opportunity for colleagues to reflect on potential biases and assumptions that may create barriers in practicing inclusion, seeking out and engaging in diverse perspectives, and collaborating to solve problems. Additionally, through our global RiseHY program, we provide career pathways for Opportunity Youth, or young people aged 16-24 who are neither in school nor working, in order to help them reach their full potential. By setting goals, measuring progress, and harnessing the power of our colleagues around the world, we strive to make a tangible impact within and beyond the walls of our properties. 
Employees
At December 31, 2020, there were more than 115,000 colleagues working at our corporate and regional offices and our managed, franchised, owned, and leased properties, and we directly employ approximately 37,000 of these colleagues. The remaining colleagues are employed by third-party owners and franchisees of our properties. Approximately 23% of our employees (approximately 25% of our U.S.-based employees) were either represented by a labor union or had terms of employment that were determined under a labor agreement. We believe relations with our employees and colleagues are good. 
Environmental Matters
In connection with our ownership, management, and development of properties, we are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under some of these laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic substances or wastes on, under or in such real property, as well as third-party sites where the owner or operator sent wastes for disposal. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew, or was at fault in connection with, the presence or release of such hazardous substances or wastes. Although we are not aware of any current material obligations for investigating or remediating hazardous substances or wastes at our owned properties, the future discovery of substances or wastes at any of our owned properties, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, could adversely affect our ability to develop or sell such real estate, or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In addition, the costs of investigating or remediating contamination at our properties or at properties where we sent substances or wastes for disposal, may be substantial. 
We are also subject to various requirements, including those contained in environmental permits required for our operations, governing air emissions, effluent discharges, the use, management, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and health and safety. From time to time, we may be required to manage, abate, or remove mold, lead, or asbestos-containing materials at our properties. We believe our properties and operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with all foreign, federal, state, and local environmental laws and ordinances. However, additional operating costs and capital expenditures could be incurred if additional or more stringent requirements are enacted in the future. 
Insurance
Properties we manage, franchise, license, own, and lease outright or through hospitality ventures are insured under different insurance programs depending on whether the property participates in our insurance programs or in the insurance programs of the property owner (including hospitality ventures), franchisee, or licensee. We maintain insurance coverage for hotels owned and leased by the Company under our insurance programs for liability, property, workers compensation, and other risks with respect to our business. Our liability insurance provides coverage for most claims, including claims related to terrorism, operations, goods and services, and automobiles, but does not provide coverage for certain losses, including pandemics and/or epidemics. Our property insurance provides coverage for all risks to our properties including fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake, and terrorism. Property insurance also includes business interruption coverage, but does not provide coverage for certain losses, including pandemics and/or epidemics. Our workers compensation insurance provides coverage for employee injuries in the course and scope of employment. Hotels owned by hospitality ventures, hotels managed by the Company, and certain franchises are permitted to participate in our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hospitality venture partners or third-party hotel owners and franchisees. The majority of hotels owned by hospitality ventures and managed hotels owned by third parties participate in our insurance programs. Our hospitality venture agreements and management agreements require hotels owned by hospitality ventures and managed hotels owned by third parties that do not participate in our insurance programs to be insured at coverage levels generally consistent with the coverage levels under our insurance programs, including liability, property, business interruption, workers compensation, and other insurance. Our 
franchise and license agreements require our franchisees and licensees to maintain liability, property, business interruption, workers compensation, and other insurance at our franchised or licensed properties. We are typically covered under insurance policies held by third-party property owners, franchisees, or licensees to the extent necessary and reasonable. We also maintain cyber-risk insurance for systems and data controlled by the Company. Cyber-risk insurance generally covers all Company-controlled systems and Company-controlled data in properties that the Company manages, franchises, licenses, owns, and leases, outright or through hospitality ventures. 
We believe the Company's insurance policies, as well as those maintained by third-party owners and franchisees, including hospitality ventures, are adequate for foreseeable losses and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary with solvent insurance carriers. We also self-insure some of our risks generally through the use of deductibles and retentions. We believe these deductibles and retentions are reasonable and customary for our industry and our size. However, there are losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. We use a U.S.-based and licensed captive insurance company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to generally insure our deductibles and retentions, but excludes most property insurance deductibles and retentions.
Stockholder Agreements 
The following is a summary of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement, the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement, and the Global Hyatt Corporation 2007 Stockholders' Agreement (the "2007 Stockholders' Agreement"). The following descriptions of these agreements do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement, Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement, and 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, copies of which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and are incorporated by reference herein.

Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement 
The trustees of the U.S. situs trusts for the benefit of certain lineal descendants of Nicholas J. Pritzker, deceased, that own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, and the adult beneficiaries of such trusts, including Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker, our executive chairman, and Mr. Jason Pritzker, one of our directors, and any of their successors that own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, have entered into the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to, among other things, certain voting agreements and limitations on the sale of shares of our common stock. At January 31, 2021, Pritzker family business interests own, directly or indirectly, 59,895,959 shares, or 59.1%, of our total outstanding common stock and control approximately 90.6% of our total voting power. Specifically, such parties have agreed that until the date upon which more than 75% of the Company's fully diluted shares of common stock is owned by persons other than Pritzker family members and spouses (including any U.S. or non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of Pritzker family members and spouses), all Pritzkers (and their successors in interest, if applicable), but not the transferees by sale (other than Pritzkers who purchase directly from other Pritzkers), will vote all of their voting securities consistent with the recommendations of our board of directors with respect to all matters assuming agreement as to any such matter by a majority of a minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) or, in the case of transactions involving us and an affiliate, assuming agreement of all of such minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker). All Pritzkers have agreed to cast and submit by proxy to us their votes in a manner consistent with the foregoing voting agreement at least five business days prior to the scheduled date of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. 
In addition, such parties have agreed that until the date upon which more than 75% of the Company's fully diluted shares of common stock is owned by persons other than Pritzker family members and spouses (including any U.S. or non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of any Pritzker family members and spouses), all Pritzker family members and spouses (including U.S. and non-U.S. situs trusts for the current or future, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, benefit of any Pritzker family members and spouses or affiliates of any thereof) in a "beneficiary group" (including trusts only to the extent of the then current benefit of members of such beneficiary group) may sell up to 25% of their aggregate holdings of our common stock, measured as of November 4, 2009, the date of effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-161068) relating to our initial public offering of our Class A common stock, in each 12-month period following the date of effectiveness of such registration statement (without carry-overs), and shall not sell more than such amount during any such period. Upon the unanimous affirmative vote of our independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker), such 25% limitation may, with respect to each such 12 month period, be increased to a higher percentage or waived entirely. Sales of our common stock, including Class A common stock and Class B common stock, between and among Pritzkers is permitted without regard to the sale restrictions described above and such sales are not counted against the 25% sale limitation. 
All shares of our common stock owned by each beneficiary group (including trusts only to the extent of the then current benefit of members of such beneficiary group) are freely pledgeable to an institutional lender and such institutional lender will not be subject to the sale restrictions described above upon default and foreclosure. 
The Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented, or restated by the written agreement of the successors to Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker, Mr. Marshall E. Eisenberg, and Mr. Karl J. Breyer, solely in their capacity as co-trustees of the Pritzker family U.S. situs trusts, 75% of the adult beneficiaries named below and a majority of the other adult beneficiaries party to the agreement. Each of Thomas J. Pritzker, Nicholas J. Pritzker, Jennifer N. Pritzker, John A. Pritzker, Linda Pritzker, Karen L. Pritzker, Penny Pritzker, Daniel F. Pritzker, Anthony N. Pritzker, Gigi Pritzker Pucker, and Jay Robert Pritzker, and their respective lineal descendants and current spouse, if relevant, make up a "beneficiary group." 
Disputes that relate to the subject matter of the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement are subject to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The exclusive requirement to arbitrate under the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement shall not apply with respect to the manner in which Hyatt's operations are conducted to the extent the parties (in their capacities as stockholders) and non-Pritzker public stockholders are affected comparably; provided, however, that a party may participate in and benefit from any shareholder litigation initiated by a non-party to the agreement. A party to the agreement may not solicit others to initiate or be a named plaintiff in such litigation (i) unless two thirds of the independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) of a board of directors having at least three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) do not vote in favor of the matter that is the subject of the litigation or (ii) in the case of affiliated transactions reviewed by our board of directors, unless at least one independent director (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) did not approve the transaction.

Pritzker and Mr. Jason Pritzker, and any of their successors that own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, have entered into the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to, among other things, certain voting agreements and limitations on the sale of shares of our common stock.

2007 Stockholders' Agreement 
In connection with the issuance and sale of 100,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to GS Sunray Holdings, L.L.C. ("GSSH") and GS Sunray Holdings Parallel, L.L.C. ("GSSHP" and collectively with GSSH, the "Goldman Sachs Funds"), affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co., and the execution of a Subscription Agreement in August 2007, we entered into the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement with Madrone GHC, LLC and affiliates (collectively, "Madrone"), the Goldman Sachs Funds, and an additional investor that provides for certain rights and obligations of these stockholders, as described below.
In May 2009, the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Goldman Sachs Funds were converted into shares of common stock. Such shares of common stock, along with shares of common stock purchased by the Goldman Sachs Funds and Madrone in May 2009 pursuant to the Subscription Agreement and in the May 2009 private placement transaction, and any other shares of common stock held by the parties to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement prior to our initial public offering, were reclassified into shares of our Class B common stock upon the filing of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation on November 4, 2009, the date of our initial public offering. At January 31, 2021, the Goldman Sachs Funds and Madrone no longer held any shares of common stock subject to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement as a result of sales into the public market subject to applicable securities laws. At January 31, 2021, the additional investor party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement held 2,270,395 shares of Class B common stock. 
Transfer Restrictions 
No stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement may transfer (1) the legal or beneficial ownership of any common stock held by such stockholder unless such acquiring person's ownership of common stock is not reasonably likely to jeopardize any licensing from a governmental authority, as determined by our board of directors in its reasonable discretion, (2) any common stock to an aggregator (meaning a person who is required to file a Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act disclosing an interest other than for investment), (3) any common stock to a competitor of ours engaged in one or more of the hospitality, lodging, and/or gaming industries or (4) any common stock that would cause a stockholder to violate any provision of the agreement. Such restrictions are qualified by the "actual knowledge" of the transferring stockholder in the case of transfers pursuant to an underwritten public offering or a broad distribution sale. 
All other transfer restrictions set forth in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement expired in May 2015. However, all shares held by such stockholders remain subject to the rights of first refusal (except as described below with respect to shares held by Madrone) and "drag along" rights described below.
Right of First Refusal 
In the event that the number of shares of common stock proposed to be transferred by a stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and its affiliates together with any shares of common stock then proposed to be transferred by the other stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and their affiliates exceeds 2% of the then outstanding shares of common stock, then prior to consummating the sale of common stock to a third-party purchaser, such stockholder or stockholders shall offer to transfer the common stock to us at the applicable market value (as defined in the 2007 Stockholders' 
Agreement). If we do not accept the offer within a specified period of time, such stockholder or stockholders may transfer the shares of common stock to the third-party purchaser as long as such transfer occurs within the time periods specified in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and on terms and conditions no more favorable in the aggregate than those offered to us. We waived all rights of first refusal with respect to shares held by the Goldman Sachs Funds and Madrone in connection with the sales into the public market by such entities.
"Drag-Along" Right 
In connection with a "change of control" (as defined in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement) transaction, we have the right to require each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement to participate in such change of control transaction on the same terms, conditions, and price per share of common stock as those applicable to the other holders of our common stock. In addition, upon our request, the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement have agreed to vote in favor of such change of control transaction or similar transaction, and we have the right to require each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement to vote for, consent to, and raise no objection to any such transaction. 
"Tag-Along" Right 
Subject to the fiduciary duties of our board of directors, we have agreed that we will not agree to consummate a change of control transaction with respect to which the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement are not given the right to participate on the same terms, conditions, and price per share of common stock as those applicable to the other holders of our common stock. 
Preemptive Rights 
Each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement has the right to purchase such stockholder's pro rata share of any new shares of common stock, or any other equity securities, that we may propose to sell and issue on comparable terms by making an election within the time periods specified in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, subject to certain excluded securities issuances described in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, including shares issued pursuant to equity compensation plans adopted by our board of directors and the issuance of shares of our common stock in a public offering. If not all stockholders elect to purchase their full preemptive allocation of new securities, then we will notify the fully-participating stockholders and offer them the right to purchase the unsubscribed new securities. 
Voting Agreement 
Until the date that Mr. Thomas J. Pritzker is no longer our chairman, each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement has agreed to vote all of their shares of common stock consistent with the recommendations of a majority of our board of directors with respect to all matters. At January 31, 2021, the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement own in the aggregate 2,270,395 shares of Class B common stock or approximately 3.7% of our Class B common stock, approximately 2.2% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock and approximately 3.4% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. 
Standstill 
Under the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement, each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement agreed that, subject to certain limited exceptions, so long as such stockholder owns shares of common stock, neither such stockholder nor any of its related persons will in any manner, directly or indirectly: 
•effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or announce any intention to effect or cause or participate in or in any way assist, facilitate, or encourage any other person to effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in, (a) any acquisition of any of our or our subsidiaries' securities (or beneficial ownership thereof) (except through the proper exercise of preemptive rights granted under the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement), or rights or options to acquire any of our or our subsidiaries' securities (or beneficial ownership thereof), or any of our or our subsidiaries' or affiliates' assets, indebtedness, or businesses, (b) any tender or exchange offer, merger, or other business combination involving us or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates or any assets constituting a significant portion of our consolidated assets, (c) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution, or other extraordinary transaction with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates, or (d) any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules under the Exchange Act) or written consents with respect to any of our or our affiliates' voting securities. For this purpose, the term "affiliates" means our affiliates primarily engaged in the hospitality, lodging, and/or gaming industries; 
•form, join, or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to us where such group seeks to acquire any of our equity securities; 
•otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek representation on or to control or influence our or our subsidiaries' management, board of directors, or policies; 
•take any action which would or would reasonably be expected to force us to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in the first bullet point above; 
•own more than 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock, unless such ownership arises as a result of any action not taken by or on behalf of such stockholder or a related person of such stockholder; or 
•request that we or any of our representatives, directly or indirectly, amend or waive any of the foregoing provisions. 
Each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement has also agreed that, if at any time during the period such stockholder is subject to the foregoing provisions, such stockholder is approached by any third party concerning its participation in any transaction or proposed transaction involving the acquisition of all or any portion of the assets, indebtedness, or securities of, or any business of, ours or any of our subsidiaries, such stockholder will promptly inform us of the nature of such transaction and the parties involved. 
Termination 
The 2007 Stockholders' Agreement terminates (1) with respect to any individual stockholder, on the first date when such stockholder no longer holds any shares of common stock and (2) in its entirety, upon the first to occur of all of our equity securities being owned by a single person or the agreement in writing by us and each stockholder party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement.
