Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 The Chemours Company is a leading global provider of performance chemicals.  We began operating as an independent company on July 1, 2015 (the Separation Date) after separating from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) (the Separation). Our company is comprised of three reportable segments: Titanium Technologies, Fluoroproducts and Chemical Solutions. Our Titanium Technologies segment is the leading global producer of titanium dioxide (TiO2), a premium white pigment used to deliver whiteness, brightness, opacity and protection in a variety of applications. Our Fluoroproducts segment is a leading global provider of fluoroproducts, including refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins. Our Chemical Solutions segment is a leading North American provider of industrial chemicals used in gold production, oil and gas, water treatment and other industries.
 Effective prior to the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on July 1, 2015, DuPont completed the separation of the businesses comprising DuPont’s Performance Chemicals reporting segment, and certain other assets and liabilities, into Chemours, a separate and distinct public company. The separation was completed by way of a distribution of all of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of Chemours through a dividend in kind of Chemours’ common stock (par value $0.01) to holders of DuPont common stock (par value $0.30) as of the close of business on June 23, 2015 (the Record Date) (the transaction is referred to herein as the Distribution).
 On the Separation Date, each holder of DuPont’s common stock received one share of Chemours’ common stock for every five shares of DuPont’s common stock held on the Record Date. The Separation was completed pursuant to a separation agreement and other agreements with DuPont, including an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, a transition services agreement and an intellectual property cross-license agreement. These agreements govern the relationship between Chemours and DuPont following the separation and provided for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. These agreements also included arrangements for transition services provided by DuPont to Chemours that were substantially completed during 2016.
 We operate 26 production facilities located in 10 countries and serve over 3,800 customers across a wide range of end markets in more than 130 countries.  The following chart illustrates the global sales of our businesses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:


Chemours is committed to creating value for our customers through the reliable delivery of high quality products and services around the globe.  We create value for customers and stockholders through (i) operational excellence and asset efficiency, which includes our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, (ii) strong customer focus to produce innovative, high-performance products, (iii) focus on cash flow generation through optimization of our cost structure, and improvement in working capital and supply chain efficiencies through our transformation plan (described below), (iv) organic growth and inorganic expansions to current business and (v) creation of an organization that is committed to our corporate values of safety, customer appreciation, simplicity, collective entrepreneurship and integrity.
 Many of Chemours’ commercial and industrial relationships span decades. Our customer base includes a diverse set of companies, many of which are leaders in their respective industries.  Our sales are not materially dependent on any single customer.  As of

The Chemours Company
 
December 31, 2016, no one individual customer balance represented more than five percent of Chemours’ total outstanding receivables balance and no one individual customer represented more than ten percent of our sales.
Chemours Five-Point Transformation Plan
 Following the Separation, Chemours developed a Five-Point Transformation Plan to address changes to our organization, cost structure and portfolio of businesses. We have made considerable progress on our transformation plan throughout 2016, with additional cost reductions and growth targeted in 2017.
 The objectives of our multi-year five-point transformation plan are to improve our financial performance, streamline and strengthen our portfolio and reduce our leverage by:
  
1. | Reducing our costs through a simpler business model;
---+-----------------------------------------------------


2. | Optimizing our portfolio to focus on our businesses where we have leading positions;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Growing our market positions where we have competitive advantages;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Refocusing our investments by concentrating our capital expenditures on our core businesses; and
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Enhancing our organization to deliver our values and support our transformation to a higher-value chemistry company.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Through cost reduction and growth, Chemours expects the transformation plan to deliver $500 million of incremental Adjusted EBITDA improvement over 2015 through 2017.  Based on our anticipated cost reduction and growth initiatives, we expect that our cost savings of approximately $350 million and approximately $150 million in improvements from growth initiatives will also improve our pre-tax earnings by similar amounts over 2015 through 2017. These improvements will be partially offset by the impact of divestitures completed during 2016, unfavorable price and mix of fluoropolymer products and may also be impacted by market factors.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a pre-tax loss and Adjusted EBITDA of $11 million and $822 million, respectively, compared to a pre-tax loss of $188 million and adjusted EBITDA of $573 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Our 2016 pre-tax loss includes net gain from divestitures of approximately $254 million offset by $335 million litigation accrual related to the PFOA MDL Settlement (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
 Through a combination of higher cash flow from operations, lower capital spending, and proceeds from asset sales, we anticipate reducing our leverage ratio (net debt to Adjusted EBITDA) to approximately three times by the end of 2017.  As of December 31, 2016, our leverage ratio is approximately 3.3 times.  
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.  For a discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the closest GAAP financial measures, see Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  
 Segments
 In our Titanium Technologies segment, we have a long-standing history of delivering high-quality TiO2 pigment using our proprietary chloride technology.  We are the largest global producer of TiO2, and our low-cost network of manufacturing facilities allows us to efficiently and cost-effectively serve our global customer base.  During 2016, we further enhanced our operating cost advantage with the startup of our second production line at our Altamira, Mexico facility.  Chemours is well positioned to remain one of the lowest cost TiO2 producers and continue to meet our customers’ growing needs around the world.
 In our Fluoroproducts segment, we are one of two globally integrated producers making both fluorochemicals and fluoropolymers.  In Fluorochemicals, we expect to see increased adoption of Opteon™, the world’s lowest global warming potential refrigerant, as governments around the world pass legislation that makes the use of low global warming potential refrigerants a requirement.  Our fluoropolymers offerings provide customers with tailored products that have unique properties, including very high temperature resistance and high chemical resistance. We will continue to invest in research and development to remain a leader in these areas, and ensure that we are able to meet our customers’ needs as regulations change.
 In our Chemical Solutions segment, we completed our strategic review of our portfolio in 2016, including the announced sales of the Beaumont Aniline facility, Clean & Disinfect business, and Sulfur products business, and ceased production at our Reactive Metals Solutions (RMS) facility in Niagara Falls, New York. We remain committed to retaining and improving our Mining Solutions

business (previously known as Cyanides business) and the product lines at our Belle, West Virginia site. We are investing in our Mining Solutions business during 2017 and 2018 to increase our capacity by approximately 50 percent. This additional capacity will allow us to serve the growing demand for sodium cyanide in the gold mining industry in the Americas.
 We will maintain our commitment to responsible stewardship and safety for our employees, customers and the communities where we operate. Meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations while conducting business in accordance with our high ethical standards will continue to be a primary focus for our company as we continue to transform Chemours into a higher-value chemistry company.
 Additional information on our segments can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Titanium Technologies Segment
 Segment Overview
 The Chemours Titanium Technologies segment is the leading global manufacturer of titanium dioxide, or TiO2.  TiO2 is a pigment used to deliver whiteness, opacity, brightness and protection from sunlight in applications such as architectural and industrial coatings, flexible and rigid plastic packaging, PVC window profiles, laminate papers, coated paper and coated paperboard used for packaging.  We sell our TiO2 products under the Ti-Pure™ brand name to over 800 customers globally. We operate four TiO2 production facilities: two in the United States (U.S.), one in Mexico and one in Taiwan.  In addition, we have a large-scale repackaging and distribution facility in Belgium and operate a mineral sands mining operation in Starke, Florida.  In total, we have a TiO2 capacity of 1.25 million metric tons per year.  In 2016, we expanded our TiO2 production facility in Altamira, Mexico.  We plan to steadily ramp up production at Altamira, with full capacity of the new line reaching approximately 200,000 metric tons annually being achieved over the next few years.
 Chemours is one of a limited number of producers operating a chloride process for the production of TiO2.  We believe that our proprietary chloride technology enables us to operate plants at a much higher capacity than other chloride technology-based TiO2 producers, uniquely utilizing a broad spectrum of titanium-bearing ore feedstocks and achieving the highest unit margins in our industry.  This technology, which is in use at all of our production facilities, provides us with one of the industry’s lowest manufacturing cost positions.  Our research and development efforts focus on improving production processes and developing TiO2 grades that help our customers achieve optimal cost and product performance.
 TiO2 demand is highly correlated to growth in the global residential housing, commercial construction and packaging markets. Industry demand for TiO2 is generally expected to be in line with global GDP growth, and can be cyclical due to economic and industry-specific market dynamics. We believe that the TiO2 demand grew above GDP growth rates in 2016 due to a pent-up demand created by destocking in 2015. We believe the market growth seen in 2016 was a combination of market growth and the return to more typical customer inventory levels. We expect TiO2 demand growth to return to approximate GDP growth rates in the long-term. Chemours’ future demand growth may be below average global GDP growth rates if our sales into developed markets outpaces our sales into emerging markets.
 Our Titanium Technologies segment net sales by region for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 is shown in the chart below:

The Chemours Company
 
We sell over 20 different grades of TiO2, with each pigment grade tailored for targeted applications.  Our portfolio of premium performance TiO2 pigment grades provide end users with benefits beyond opacity, such as longer lasting performance, brighter colors and the brilliant whites achievable only through Chloride manufactured pigment.
 We have operated a titanium mine in Starke, Florida since 1949.  The mine provides us with access to a low cost source of domestic, high quality ilmenite ore feedstock and supplies less than ten percent of our ore feedstock consumption needs.  Co-products of our mining operations, which comprised less than five percent of our total sales in Titanium Technologies in 2016, are zircon (zirconium silicate) and staurolite minerals.  We are a major supplier of high quality calcined zircon in North America, primarily focused on the precision investment casting (PIC) industry, foundry and specialty applications, and ceramics.  Our staurolite blasting abrasives, sold as Starblast, are used in steel preparation and maintenance, and paint removal.
 Revenue and earnings performance in Titanium Technologies reflect the cyclical nature of the global TiO2 business. TiO2 pricing tends to move up and down in a cyclical manner depending in large part on global economic conditions. Following the global financial crisis in 2008, global economic recovery, resulting from the impact of government stimulus, resulted in strong customer demand for TiO2 compared to available supply. This drove TiO2 prices higher, ultimately reaching a historical peak in 2012. New industry capacity, stimulated by that period of strong demand between 2008-2012, came online at the same time that global GDP fell back to a 2-3 percent annual growth rate. This oversupply situation resulted in price declines, until early 2016. We believe the TiO2 industry has moved past the bottom of the cycle and has returned to a modest level of profitability. As described, Titanium Technologies has unique capabilities which deliver the industry’s best cost position, resulting in strong operating cash flow.
 Industry Overview and Competitors
 We estimate the worldwide demand for TiO2 in 2016 was approximately 5.7 million metric tons, of which 3.6 million metric tons were for premium performance pigments. Worldwide capacity in 2016 was estimated to be approximately 7.0 million metric tons. The products manufactured on this global capacity base are not fully substitutable due to pigment quality consistency and pigment product design. We believe that the utilization of the premium performance manufacturing base is considerably higher than that for general purpose - lower performance production.
 Competition in the TiO2 pigment market is based primarily on product performance (both product design and quality consistency), supply capability and technical service.  Our major competitors within higher performance pigments include: The National Titanium Dioxide Company, Ltd. (Cristal), Huntsman International LLC, Kronos Worldwide, Inc. and Tronox Limited.
 Beyond multi-national suppliers, the other TiO2 pigment producers are very fragmented and mostly utilize the sulfate production process and compete in the general purpose – lower performance pigment market.  In 2016, the combination of Sichuan Lomon and Henan Billions into the Lomon Billions entity demonstrated the consolidation of Chinese producers and created a large global producer representing approximately eight percent of global capacity.  In the next one to three years, industry experts believe that there will be no new capacity added outside of China. Within China, the announced added effective capacity is expected to be somewhat offset by capacity shutdowns at marginal producers.  Certain new capacity additions announced in China are based on a chloride technology.  
 Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of TiO2 are titanium-bearing ores, chlorine, calcined petroleum coke and energy.  We source titanium-bearing ores from a number of suppliers around the globe, who are primarily located in Australia and Africa.  Our titanium mine in Starke, Florida supplies less than ten percent of our raw material needs.  To ensure proper supply volume and to minimize pricing volatility, we generally enter into contracts in which volume is requirement-based and pricing is determined by a range of mechanisms structured to help us achieve competitive pricing relative to the market.  We typically enter into a combination of long- and mid-term supply contracts and source our raw material from multiple suppliers across different regions and from multiple sites per supplier.  Furthermore, we typically purchase multiple grades of ore from each supplier to limit our exposure to any single supplier for any single grade of ore in any given time period.  Historically, we have not experienced any problems renewing such contracts for raw materials or securing our supply of titanium-bearing ores.
 We play an active role in ore source development around the globe, especially for those ores which can only be used by Chemours, given the capability of our unique process technology.  Supply chain flexibility allows for ore purchase and use optimization to manage short-term demand fluctuations and provides long-term competitive advantage.  Our process technology and ability to use lower grade ilmenite ore gives us the flexibility to alter our ore mix to the lowest cost configuration based on sales, demand and projected ore pricing.  Lastly, we have taken steps to optimize routes for distribution and increase storage capacity at our production facilities.

The Chemours Company
 
Transporting chlorine, one of our primary raw materials, can be costly.  To reduce our expense and our need to transport chlorine, we have a chlor-alkali production facility run by a third party that is co-located at our New Johnsonville, Tennessee site. Calcined petroleum coke is an important raw material input to our process.  We source calcined petroleum coke from well-established suppliers in North America and China, typically under contracts that run multiple years to facilitate material and logistics planning through the supply chain.  Distribution efficiency is enhanced through use of bulk ocean, barge and rail transportation modes.
 Energy is another key input cost into the TiO2 manufacturing process, representing approximately ten percent of the production cost.  Chemours has access to natural gas based energy at our U.S. and Mexico TiO2 production facilities and our Florida minerals plant, supporting advantaged energy costs given the low cost shale gas in the U.S.  Natural gas-based cogeneration of steam and electricity was recently extended as part of the major expansion at one of our TiO2 production facilities.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 We sell the majority of our products through a direct sales force.  We also utilize third-party sales agents and distributors to expand our reach.  TiO2 represents a significant raw material cost for our customers and as a result, purchasing decisions are often made by our customers’ senior management team.  Our sales organization works to develop and maintain close relationships with key decision makers in our value chain.
 In addition, our sales and technical service teams work together to develop relationships with all layers of our customers’ organizations to ensure that we meet our customers’ commercial and technical requirements.  When appropriate, we collaborate closely with customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying product characteristics or developing new product grades.
 To ensure an efficient distribution, we have a large fleet of railcars, which are predominantly used for outbound distribution of products in the U.S. and Canada.  A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and maintain an efficient supply chain.
 Customers
 Globally, we serve over 800 customers through our Titanium Technologies segment.  In 2016, our ten largest Titanium Technologies customers accounted for approximately 30 percent of the segment’s sales. No single Titanium Technologies customer represented more than ten percent of our segment sales in 2016. Our larger customers in the U.S. and Europe are typically served through direct sales and tend to have medium- to long-term contracts with annual supply volume requirements and periodic price adjustment mechanisms.  We serve our small- and mid-size customers through a combination of our direct sales and distribution network.
 Our direct customers in Titanium Technologies are producers of decorative coatings, automotive and industrial coatings, polyolefin masterbatches, polyvinylchloride window profiles, engineering polymers, laminate paper, coatings paper and coated paperboard.  We focus on developing long-term partnerships with key market participants in each of these sectors.  We also deliver a high level of technical service to satisfy our customers’ specific needs, which helps us maintain strong customer relationships.
 Seasonality
 The demand for TiO2 is subject to seasonality due to the influence of weather conditions and holiday seasons on some of our applications, such as decorative coatings.  As a result, our TiO2 sales volume is typically lowest in the first quarter, highest in the second and third quarters and moderate in the fourth quarter.  This pattern applies to the entire TiO2 market, but may vary by region, country or application.  It can also be altered by economic or other demand cycles.
 Fluoroproducts Segment
 Segment Overview
 Our Fluoroproducts segment is a global leader in providing fluorine-based, advanced material solutions.  The segment creates products that have unique properties such as high temperature resistance, high chemical resistance and unique di-electric properties for applications across a broad array of industries and applications.  We are a global leader in providing fluoroproducts, such as refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins and derivatives.  
 7

The Chemours Company
 
The manufacturing of fluoroproducts involves complex processes which include the use of highly corrosive and hazardous intermediates.  We have an industry-leading safety culture and apply world-class technical expertise to ensure that our operations run safely and reliably. These capabilities, alongside our research and development expertise, allow us to continuously improve our process technology.
 We sell fluoroproducts through two primary product groups: Fluorochemicals and Fluoropolymers.
 Fluorochemicals products include refrigerants, air conditioning, foam expansion agents, propellants and fire extinguishants. We have held a leading position in the fluorochemicals market since the commercial introduction of Freon™ in 1930. Since the original chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) based product was introduced, we have been at the forefront of new-technology research for lower global warming potential and ozone depleting products, leading to the development of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). We have a leading position in HFC refrigerants under the brand name Freon™ and are a leader in the development of sustainable technologies like Opteon™, a line of low Global Warming Potential (GWP) hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) refrigerants, which also have a zero ozone depletion footprint.  Opteon™ was jointly developed with Honeywell International, Inc., in response to the European Union’s (EU) Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC) Directive. This patented technology offers similar functionality to current HFC products but meets or exceeds currently mandated environmental standards and in some cases, provides energy efficiency benefits.
 We led the industry in the Montreal-Protocol (1987) driven transition from CFCs to the lesser ozone depleting HCFCs and non-ozone depleting HFCs.  In 1988, we committed to cease production of CFCs and started manufacturing non-ozone depleting HFCs in the early 1990s.  Driven by new and emerging environmental legislations and standards currently being implemented across the U.S., Europe, Latin America and Japan, we have commercialized Opteon™. Over the years, regulation has pushed the industry to evolve and respond to environmental concerns.  We will continue to invest in research and development to ensure that we remain a leader and are able to meet our customers’ needs as regulations change.
 Fluorochemicals’ refrigerant sales fluctuate by season as sales in the first half of the year generally are slightly higher than sales in the second half of the year. However, Opteon™ sales into mobile air markets will be driven by automotive production, which may lead to less seasonality within Fluorochemicals overall.
 Fluoropolymers products include various industrial resins, coatings, and other downstream products. We serve a wide range of industrial and end-user applications spanning from wearable electronics to automotive, network cables, pipe lining and gaskets, among others. Our products’ unique properties include corrosion resistance, non-stick adhesion, thermal stability, and extreme temperature resistance.
 Our Fluoropolymers products are sold under the brand names Teflon™, Viton™, Krytox™, and Nafion™. Teflon™ coatings and additives are used in multiple end products including paints, fabrics, carpets, clothing, and other household applications. Teflon™ coatings, resins, additives and films are also used in a wide range of industrial products. Our fluoroelastomer products, sold under the Viton™ brand name, are used in automotive, consumer electronics, chemical processing, oil and gas, petroleum refining and transportation, and aircraft and aerospace applications. Our Krytox™ branded lubricants are used in a broad range of industrial applications, including bearings, electric motors, and gearboxes. We sell membranes under the brand name Nafion™, which are used in fuel cells, energy flow battery storage, transportation, stationary power, and medical tubing.

Fluoropolymers | #1 Globally | Diversified industrial applications | Daikin, 3M, Solvay, Asahi Glass Company, Dongyue, Chenguang

 Fluoroproducts demand growth is generally in line with global GDP.  Within Fluorochemicals, growth may be expected to be higher than GDP in situations where, for environmental reasons, regulatory drivers constrain the market or drive the market toward lower global warming alternatives. In Fluoropolymers, market growth is expected to be in line with GDP but influenced by increased competition and pricing pressure in some businesses. 
 9

The Chemours Company
 
Developed markets represent the largest fluoroproducts markets today.  Global middle class growth and the increasing demand for expanding infrastructure, consumer electronics, telecommunications, automobiles, refrigerators and air conditioners are all key drivers of increased demand for various fluoroproducts.
Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials required to support the Fluoroproducts segment are fluorspar, chlorinated organics, chlorinated inorganics, hydrofluoric acid and vinylidene fluoride.  These are available in many countries and not concentrated in any particular region.
 Our supply chains are designed for maximum competitiveness through favorable sourcing of key raw materials.  Our contracts typically include terms that span from two to ten years, except for select resale purchases that are negotiated on a monthly basis.  Most qualified Fluorspar sources have fixed contract prices or freely negotiated market-based pricing.  Although the fluoroproduct industry has historically relied primarily on fluorspar exports from China, Chemours has diversified its sourcing through multiple geographic regions and suppliers to ensure a stable and cost competitive supply.  Our current supply agreements are generally in effect for the next five years.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 With more than 85 years of innovation and development in fluorine science, our technical, marketing and sales teams around the world have deep expertise in our products and their end-uses.  We work with customers to select the appropriate fluoroproducts to meet their technical performance needs.  We sell our products through direct channels and through resellers.  Selling agreements vary by product line and markets served and include both spot pricing arrangements and contracts with a typical duration of one year.
 We maintain a large fleet of railcars, tank trucks and containers to deliver our products and support our supply chain needs.  For the portion of the fleet that is leased, related lease terms are usually staggered, which provides us with a competitive cost position as well as the ability to adjust the size of our fleet in response to changes in market conditions.  A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment to product lines and geographic regions in order to maximize utilization and flexibility of the supply chain.
 Customers
 We serve approximately 2,700 customers and distributors globally, and in many instances, these commercial relationships have been in place for decades.  No single Fluoroproducts customer represented more than ten percent of the segment’s sales in 2016.
Seasonality
 Seasonality in Fluorochemicals sales is mainly driven by increased demand for residential, commercial and automotive air conditioning in the spring.  This demand peaks in the summer months and declines in the fall and winter.  Commercial refrigeration demand is fairly steady throughout the year, but demand is slightly higher during the summer months.  There is no significant seasonality for Fluoropolymers, as demand is relatively consistent throughout the year.
 Chemical Solutions Segment
 Segment Overview
 Our Chemical Solutions segment comprises a portfolio of industrial chemical businesses primarily operating in the Americas.  The Chemical Solutions segment’s products are used as important raw materials and catalysts for a diverse group of industries including, among others, gold production, oil and gas, water treatment, electronics and automotive.  We are a leading provider of sodium cyanide in the Americas through our Mining Solutions business. Chemical Solutions generates value through the use of market leading manufacturing technology, safety performance, product stewardship, and differentiated logistics capabilities.
 As part of our transformation plan announced in 2015, we conducted a strategic review of our Chemical Solutions segment. The process resulted in the divestiture of three assets and businesses, the shutdown of one business and the decision to retain the remaining businesses. Specifically, we sold our Aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas to The Dow Chemical Company in March 2016.  We also sold our Sulfur Products business to Veolia in July 2016 and our Clean & Disinfect business to LANXESS Corporation (“Lanxess”) in August 2016. These divestitures resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $685 million in 2016. In addition, we ceased production at our RMS facility in Niagara Falls, New York in September 2016. The segment continues to include our mining solutions business

 Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property, including trade secrets, certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how and other proprietary rights, is a critical part of maintaining our technology leadership and competitive edge.  Our business strategy is to file patent and trademark applications globally for proprietary new product and application development technologies.  We hold many patents, particularly in 
 12

our Fluoroproducts segment, as described herein.  These patents, including various patents that will expire from 2017 through 2034, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance to our business.  However, we believe that no single patent (or related group of patents) is material in relation to our business as a whole.  In addition, particularly in our Titanium Technologies segment, we hold significant intellectual property in the form of trade secrets and, while we believe that no single trade secret is material in relation to our combined business as a whole, we believe they are material in the aggregate.  Unlike patents, trade secrets do not have a predetermined validity period, but are valid indefinitely, so long as their secrecy is maintained. We work actively on a global basis to create, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.  The protection afforded by these patents and trademarks varies based on country, scope of individual patent and trademark coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country.  Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to the success of our company, we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any particular patent or trademark.  We believe that securing our intellectual property is critical to maintaining our technology leadership and our competitive position, especially with respect to new technologies or the extensions of existing technologies.  Our proprietary process technology is also a source of incremental income through licensing arrangements.
 Our Titanium Technologies segment in particular relies upon unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position in this space.  Our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology and our business could be harmed if our trade secrets are not maintained in confidence. In our Titanium Technologies intellectual property portfolio, we consider our trademark Ti-Pure™ to be a valuable asset and have registered this trademark in a number of countries.
 Our Fluoroproducts segment is the technology leader in the markets in which it participates.  We have one of the largest patent portfolios in the fluorine derivatives industry.  In our Fluoroproducts intellectual property portfolio, we consider our Freon™, Opteon™, Teflon™, Viton™, NafionTM and Krytox™ trademarks to be valuable assets.
 Our Chemical Solutions segment is a manufacturing and application development technology leader in a majority of the markets in which it participates.  Trade secrets are one of the key elements of our intellectual property security in Chemical Solutions as most of the segment’s manufacturing and application development technologies are no longer under patent coverage.
 At separation, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an intellectual property cross-license agreement with DuPont, pursuant to which (i) DuPont has agreed to license to Chemours certain patents, know-how and technical information owned by DuPont or its affiliates and necessary or useful in Chemours’ business, and (ii) Chemours has agreed to license to DuPont certain patents owned by Chemours or its affiliates and necessary or useful in DuPont’s business.  In most circumstances, the licenses are perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable (in connection with the party’s business), assignable (in connection with a sale of the applicable portion of a party’s business or assets, subject to certain exceptions) worldwide licenses in connection with the current operation of the businesses and, with respect to specified products and fields of use, future operation of such businesses, subject to certain limitations with respect to specified products and fields of use.
 Research and Development
 We perform research and development activities in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the Fluoroproducts segment.  The Fluoroproducts segment efforts center on developing new sustainable fluorochemicals as well as determining new applications and formulations for fluoropolymers that meet customers’ technical requirements.  In Titanium Technologies and Chemical Solutions, our efforts are focused on process technology to reduce cost and maintain safety and stewardship standards.  The table below sets forth the last three years of research and development expense by segment:

Backlog
 In general, the Company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity.  Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand.  Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is not material to understanding its

overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
