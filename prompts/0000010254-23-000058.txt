Item 1. Business
Overview
Earthstone Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Earthstone” and together with our consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” “our,” “we,” “us,” or similar terms), is a growth-oriented independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and gas reserves through activities that include drilling and development of undeveloped leases, as well as asset and corporate acquisitions and mergers. Our operations are all in the upstream segment of the oil and natural gas industry and all our properties are onshore in the United States. Our primary assets are located in the Midland Basin in West Texas and the Delaware Basin in New Mexico.
2022 Highlights 
The following are highlights of our 2022 activities: 
•Closed the Titus Acquisition in the Delaware Basin on August 10, 2022
•Closed the Bighorn Acquisition in the Midland Basin on April 14, 2022
•Closed the Chisholm Acquisition in the Delaware Basin on February 15, 2022
•Repurchased 3.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock for $43.7 million
•Full year 2022 average daily sales volumes of 78,167 Boepd exceeded our production goals and increased 215% over 2021
•Maintained strong balance sheet and liquidity position with $679.9 million of undrawn capacity on our $1.2 billion senior credit facility as of December 31, 2022
•Continued development of our properties which included drilling 75 gross / 58.9 net operated wells and completing 56 gross / 46.5 net operated wells
For the three acquisitions that we closed during 2022, we spent a total of approximately $1.5 billion, net of customary purchase price adjustments, and issued 28,925,468 shares of our Class A common stock, $0.001 par value per share of Earthstone (the “Class A Common Stock”), with an acquisition date fair value of $380.8 million. In the aggregate, these acquisitions added significant scale by expanding our Permian Basin acreage footprint by approximately 66% gross / 48% net, increasing our estimated proved reserves by 213.1 MMBoe as well as increasing our sales volumes by 16.7 MMBoe for the year then ended.
Organizational Structure
Earthstone is the sole managing member of Earthstone Energy Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Earthstone (“EEH”). Earthstone, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lynden Energy Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of British Columbia (“Lynden Corp”), and Lynden Corp’s wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, Lynden USA Inc. (“Lynden US”), collectively own a 75.5% interest in EEH. We consolidate the financial results of EEH and present a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements representing the economic interests of EEH’s members other than Earthstone and Lynden US. Each of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock has a corresponding unit of limited liability company interests denominated as a common unit in EEH (an “EEH Unit”). Each of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, $0.001 par value per share of Earthstone (the “Class B Common Stock”), has a corresponding EEH Unit and collectively represent the noncontrolling interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. 
At any time, at the holder’s discretion, a holder of an EEH Unit may receive a share of Class A Common Stock in exchange for an EEH Unit and a corresponding share of Class B Common Stock, resulting in the immediate cancellation of both the EEH Unit and share of Class B Common Stock exchanged. As of December 31, 2022, outstanding common shares of Earthstone, along with the equal number of corresponding outstanding EEH Units, were approximately 139.8 million, consisting of 105.5 million shares of Class A Common Stock and 34.3 million shares of Class B Common Stock.

Offering costs related to the closing of the SPA were approximately $0.7 million.
On July 6, 2022, all of the PIPE Shares were converted into 25,225,225 shares of Class A Common Stock. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is no longer outstanding and the Investors were issued 25,225,225 shares of Class A Common Stock upon the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
On April 14, 2022, in connection with the closing of the SPA, Earthstone and the Investors entered into a customary registration rights agreement relating to the shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the PIPE Shares. On July 15, 2022, a registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to the resale of the PIPE shares was filed with the SEC and became automatically effective upon filing.
Notes Offering
On April 7, 2022, EEH and four of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Earthstone Operating, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Earthstone Operating”), Earthstone Permian LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Earthstone Permian”), Sabine River Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Sabine River Energy”), and Independence Resources Technologies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Independence Technology” and, together with Earthstone Operating, Earthstone Permian, Sabine River Energy and Earthstone, the “Guarantors”), entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with RBC Capital Markets, LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers named in the Purchase Agreement (together, the “Initial Purchasers”), providing for the private offer and sale by EEH (the “Notes Offering”) of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of EEH’s 8.000% senior notes due 2027 (the “Notes”), along with related guarantees (the “Guarantees”) of the Notes. 
The Notes Offering closed on April 12, 2022. EEH received net proceeds from the Notes Offering of approximately $537.2 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions) which was used primarily to fund the Bighorn Acquisition and the remainder for general corporate purposes. 
Chisholm Acquisition
On February 15, 2022, Earthstone, EEH, and Chisholm, as seller, consummated the transactions contemplated in the Chisholm Agreement that was previously reported on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 17, 2021. At the closing of the Chisholm Agreement, among other things, EEH acquired (the “Chisholm Acquisition”) interests in oil and gas leases and related property of Chisholm located in Lea County and Eddy County, New Mexico, for aggregate consideration, as adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments, consisting of: (i) approximately $314.0 million in cash paid at the closing of the Chisholm Acquisition, (ii) $70 million in cash paid on April 15, 2022, and (iii) 19,417,476 shares of Class A Common Stock valued at its NYSE closing price on February 15, 2022 of $12.85 per share. See further discussion in Note 14. Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash consideration for the Chisholm Acquisition was funded by borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
Inflation
Inflation has increased costs associated with our capital program and production operations. We have experienced increases in the costs of many of the materials, supplies, equipment and services used in our operations and we expect inflation to continue based on current economic circumstances. In addition, the attempts to reduce inflation by the Federal Reserve have resulted in increased interest rates on debt and contributed to debt and equity market volatility. We continue to closely monitor costs and take all reasonable steps to mitigate the inflationary effect on our cost structure and also work to enhance our efficiency to minimize additional cost increases where possible. 
Our Properties
As operator, across the majority of our acreage in the Midland and Delaware Basins, we manage and are able to directly influence development and production of our operated properties. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with drilling and completion activities. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work on improving drilling and completion processes, operating costs, production rates and reserves. Our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows, subject to commodity price and cost fluctuations. Our status as an operator has allowed us to pursue the development of undeveloped acreage, further develop existing properties and generate new projects.
As is common in our industry, we selectively participate in drilling and developmental activities in non-operated properties. Decisions to participate in non-operated properties are dependent upon the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators.
Overall
As of December 31, 2022, our estimated proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves were approximately 367,936 MBoe based on the reserve report prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CG&A”), our independent petroleum engineers. Based on this report, at December 31, 2022, our estimated proved reserve quantities were approximately 38% oil, 34% natural gas and 29% natural gas liquids with 72% of those reserves classified as proved developed.
Midland Basin
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 167,000 net acres in the Midland Basin that are highly contiguous on a project-by-project basis which allow us to drill multi-well pads. Of this acreage, 95% is operated and 5% is non-operated. Approximately 99% of the Midland Basin net acreage is held by production. We hold an approximate 96% working interest in our operated acreage and an approximate 45% working interest in our non-operated acreage. As of December 31, 2022, we had interests in approximately 263 gross / 206 net vertical and 998 gross / 855 net horizontal producing wells, of which we operate 177 vertical and 882 horizontal wells.
During 2022, we completed and began producing from 34 gross / 30.4 net operated wells and 20 gross / 4.1 net non-operated wells. 
We are currently operating two drilling rigs in the Midland Basin, both of which are currently drilling in Reagan County, Texas. 
Delaware Basin
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 45,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin in New Mexico that are highly contiguous on a project-by-project basis which allow us to drill multi-well pads. Of this acreage, 92% is operated and 8% is non-operated. Approximately 90% of the Delaware Basin net acreage is held by production. We hold an approximate 60% working interest in our operated acreage and an approximate 26% working interest in our non-operated acreage. As of December 31, 2022, we had interests in approximately 265 gross / 94 net vertical and 265 gross / 144 net horizontal producing wells, of which we operate 101 vertical and 159 horizontal wells.
During 2022, we completed and began producing from 25 gross / 18.2 net operated wells and 4 gross / 0.7 net non-operated wells.
We are currently operating three drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin, all of which are currently drilling in Lea County, New Mexico.
Our Business Strategy 
We believe that the recent trend of consolidation in the industry environment will continue and will result in further consolidation opportunities. We continue to pursue value-accretive and scale-enhancing consolidation opportunities, as we believe we are in a position to operate effectively despite volatility in commodity prices. We are focusing our attention on acquisition and corporate merger opportunities that would increase the scale of our operations in a financially accretive manner, without materially altering our debt metrics in relation to our cash flows and capital structure. In addition, we believe that our recent track record of successful consolidation will create further consolidation opportunities for us based on our increased scale, financial strength and success at acquiring and integrating assets in a financially prudent manner. At the same time, we will seek to block up acreage in the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin that would allow for longer horizontal laterals and should therefore provide for higher economic returns. In summary, we believe we are well qualified to be a consolidator which would increase the scale of our operations and add value to our shareholders.
Our current business strategy is to focus on the economic development of our existing acreage, increase our acreage and horizontal well locations in the Midland and Delaware Basins and increase stockholder value through the following:
•developing our acreage and profitably growing our production while seeking to maximize operating cash flows;
•operating our properties efficiently and continuing to improve our operating margins;
•deploying capital efficiently by drilling multi-well pads, reducing drilling times and increasing completions per day;
•leveraging both our increased operational and financial scale to achieve economies related to such scale where available;
•operating our assets in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner;
•continuing to hedge commodity prices as opportunities arise;
•pursuing value-accretive acquisition and corporate merger opportunities, which could increase the scale and profitability of our operations;
•maximizing operating margins and corporate level cash flows by minimizing operating and overhead costs;
•expanding our acreage positions and drilling inventory in our primary areas of interest through acquisitions and farm-in opportunities, with an emphasis on operated positions;
•blocking up acreage to allow for longer horizontal lateral drilling locations which provide higher economic returns; and
•maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.
Our Strengths
We believe that the following strengths are beneficial in achieving our business goals:
•history of successful asset acquisitions and merger transactions;
•extensive horizontal development potential in two of the most oil rich basins of the United States;
•experienced management team with substantial technical and operational expertise;
•ability to attract technical personnel with experience in our core area of operations;
•operating control over the majority of our production and development activities;
•financial discipline;
•effectively managing leverage;
•commitment to cost efficient operations;
•a management team that is well known and respected throughout the industry; and
•ability to efficiently integrate acquisitions, allowing us to improve operating margins, as well as reducing lead time on additional acquisition opportunities.
COVID-19
Despite the recoveries in commodity prices, COVID-19 may continue to impact the global economy, disrupt supply chains and may create significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. The potential future impact of COVID-19 
on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to fully execute our business strategies and efficiently operate our properties is uncertain and depends on numerous non-controllable factors. A material resurgence of COVID-19 may impact the demand for oil and natural gas, the availability of personnel, equipment and services critical to the operation of our properties. There is significant uncertainty around the extent and duration of disruptions from any such resurgence, but we expect that the longer the disruption, the greater the adverse impact may be on our business. 
Operational Status
As a producer of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we are recognized as an essential business under various federal, state and local regulations related to COVID-19. The safety of our employees is paramount, and we have emphasized the respective guidelines to support our mitigation efforts. Our field personnel have performed their job responsibilities with no issues to date. We required full-time office attendance for non-field personnel during 2021 and 2022, but remained flexible to working remotely, if needed. We will continue to focus on the health and safety of our employees in conformity with the applicable jurisdictional mitigation guidelines. 
Operational/Financial Challenges
It is difficult to model and predict how our operations and financial status may change as a result of COVID-19. In our industry, any forecast, plans and changes to operations and financial status are a function of commodity prices, inflationary pressures and prevailing capital and operating costs. If oil and gas prices decline significantly due to a resurgence of COVID-19, we believe we can take immediate steps to operate and produce our properties at least in a cash flow neutral position for the next 12 months. If a material resurgence of COVID-19 triggered a substantial adverse response from banks and financial institutions, our borrowing base could be reduced, resulting in a borrowing base deficiency in relation to outstanding debt which may lead to a default. 
Operational Risks
Oil and natural gas exploitation, development and production involve a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will acquire, discover or produce additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental leakage or spills of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce our available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities.
As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. For further discussion of these risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.
Marketing and Customers
We market the majority of the production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties. We sell our production to purchasers at market prices.
We normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business. For the year ended December 31, 2022, three purchasers accounted for 21%, 20% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, two purchasers accounted for 34% and 13%, respectively, of our revenue during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, three purchasers accounted for 32%, 15% and 12%, respectively, of our revenue during the period. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. If a major customer stopped purchasing oil and natural gas from us, revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. However, we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products in our area of operations with well-established markets and numerous purchasers.
Transportation and Gathering
During the planning stage of our prospective and productive units and acreage, we consider required flow-lines, gathering and delivery infrastructure. Our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries or delivery points through our flow-lines or gathering systems. Purchasers of our oil take delivery (i) at a pipeline delivery point or (ii) at our tank batteries for transport by truck. Our natural gas is transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s meter and pipeline interconnection point through our gathering systems. We have implemented a Leak Detection and Repair program, or LDAR, to locate and repair leaking components including valves, pumps and connectors in order to minimize the emission of fugitive volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants. In addition, we install vapor recovery units in our newly installed tank batteries which also reduces emissions.
Our produced salt water is generally moved by pipeline connected to our operated saltwater disposal wells or by pipeline to commercial disposal facilities.
Commodity Hedging
Consistent with our disciplined approach to financial management, we have an active commodity hedging program through which we seek to hedge a meaningful portion of our expected oil and gas production, reducing our exposure to downside commodity prices and enabling us to protect cash flows and maintain liquidity to fund our capital program.
Competition
The domestic oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in the acquisition of acreage, production and oil and gas reserves and in producing, transporting and marketing activities. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, drilling partnership programs, individual producers, natural gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies. They may be able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on prospective oil and natural gas properties and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties, than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties in the future, and our ability to fund the acquisition of such properties, will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate related transactions in a highly competitive environment.
There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
Segment Information and Geographic Area
Operating segments are defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as components of an enterprise that (i) engage in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (ii) for which separate operational financial information is available and is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance.
Based on our organization and management, we have only one reportable operating segment, which is oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production. All of our operations are currently conducted in Texas and New Mexico.
Seasonality of Business
Weather conditions often affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay oil and natural gas drilling, completion and production activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.
Markets for Sale of Production
Our ability to market oil and natural gas found and produced, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, the effect of which cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated. Some of these factors include, without limitation, the availability of other 
domestic and foreign production, the marketing of competitive fuels, the proximity and capacity of pipelines, fluctuations in supply and demand, the availability of a ready market, the effect of United States federal and state regulation of production, refining, transportation and sales and general national and worldwide economic conditions. Additionally, we may experience delays in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices and we may experience short-term delays in marketing oil due to trucking and refining constraints. There is no assurance that we will be able to market significant amounts of oil or natural gas produced, or, if such oil or natural gas is marketed, that favorable prices can be obtained.
The United States natural gas market has undergone several significant changes over the past few decades. The majority of federal price ceilings were removed in 1985 and the remainder were lifted by the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989. Thus, currently, the United States natural gas market is operating in a free market environment in which the price of gas is determined by market forces rather than by regulations. At the same time, the domestic natural gas industry has also seen a dramatic change in the manner in which gas is bought, sold and transported. In most cases, natural gas is no longer sold to a pipeline company. Instead, the pipeline company now primarily serves the role of transporter and gas producers are free to sell their product to marketers, local distribution companies, end users or a combination thereof.
In view of the many uncertainties affecting the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we are unable to accurately predict future oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices or the overall effect, if any, that the decline in demand for and the oversupply of such products will have on our financial condition or results of operations.

We believe that the title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of our oil and natural gas properties. Our oil and natural gas properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:
•royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and natural gas leases;
•overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;
•a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, participation agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles;
•back-ins and reversionary interests existing under various agreements and leasehold assignments;
•liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements;
•pooling, unitization and other agreements, declarations and orders; and
•easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property.
To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the quantity and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our oil and natural gas properties are common in our industry with respect to the types of properties we own.
Operational Regulations
All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory and regulatory provisions affecting drilling, completion, and production activities, including, but not limited to, provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Moreover, the current administration has indicated that it expects to impose additional federal regulations limiting access to and production from federal lands. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, while some states, including New Mexico, allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate development, other states including Texas, where we operate, rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if we own or control less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or 
other restrictions on exploration, development and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration, development and production to proceed.
The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and negatively affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
Regulation of Transportation of Natural Gas
The transportation and sale, or resale, of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Regulation of Sales of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
The prices at which we sell oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, are not subject to state regulation. FERC, however, regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of transportation service, which affects the marketing of the natural gas we produce, as well as the prices we receive for sales of our natural gas. Similarly, the price we receive from the sale of oil and natural gas liquids is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. FERC regulates the transportation of oil and liquids on interstate pipelines under the provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and regulations issued under those statutes. Intrastate transportation of oil, natural gas liquids, and other products, is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. In addition, while sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 
Changes in FERC or state policies and regulations or laws may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action that FERC or state regulatory bodies will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are also subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge and emission of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a well or production related facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part.
Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs, may affect our business including oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a 
summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain categories of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of, or transported, hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these potentially responsible persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from the definition of hazardous substance, in the course of our operations, we have generated and will generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substance and may have disposed of these wastes at disposal sites owned and operated by others. Comparable state statutes may not provide a comparable exemption for petroleum. Moreover, the EPA has begun to utilize CERCLA to further its “environmental justice” goals by focusing enforcement of cleanup efforts in underserved and overburdened areas. The EPA defines environmental justice as “the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.” We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells for which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, but we are not presently aware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially or adversely affect us.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and solid (non-hazardous) wastes. With the approval of the EPA, the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s solid (non-hazardous) waste provisions. However, legislation has been proposed from time to time and various environmental groups have filed lawsuits that, if successful, could result in the reclassification of certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make such wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas E&P industry’s, costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the industry as well as on our business.
From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes.
Water Discharges
The federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In January 2023, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule that revises the definition of “waters of the United States”. The final rule has been challenged by several states and industry groups. As a result of these developments, the scope of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act is uncertain at this time.
The process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay our operations, and any expansion of permitting jurisdiction over wetlands or streams could result in further delays and additional operating costs. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and 
criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.
Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of saltwater disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. In New Mexico, the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (“NMOCD”) administers the UIC program for all injection wells that are related to oil and natural gas production. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”) regulates the disposal of produced water by injection well. Permits must be obtained before drilling saltwater disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and natural gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or placed volumetric injection limits on existing wells or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. In response to concerns related to induced seismicity, regulators in some states have already adopted or are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the RRC has adopted rules for injection wells to address these seismic activity concerns in Texas. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. In 2021, the NMOCD announced a new plan for responding to increased seismic activity in the Permian Basin. Under the new plan, pending permits for wastewater injection in certain areas will be subject to additional reporting and monitoring requirements. More stringent regulation of injection wells could lead to reduced construction or the capacity of such wells, which could in turn impact the availability of injection wells for disposal of wastewater from our operations. Increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. The costs associated with the disposal of proposed water are commonly incurred by all oil and natural gas producers, however, and we do not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, third-party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing which is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations in order to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator.
The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the UIC program. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process.
Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the fracturing process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program, specifically as “Class II” UIC wells.
In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment (“CWT”) facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.
Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings 
and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
Several states, including Texas, have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. For example, Texas law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) for disclosure on a website and also file the list of chemicals with the RRC with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the RRC. Additionally, New Mexico has adopted regulations that require the disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process. If new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. Several lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.
From time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. On January 28, 2020, Senate Bill 3247 was introduced and if enacted as proposed, would ban hydraulic fracturing nationwide by 2025.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws restrict emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop strict and stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants.
In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued New Source Performance Standards to regulate emissions of sources of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), sulfur dioxide, air toxics and methane from various oil and natural gas exploration, production, processing and transportation facilities. On May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, the Trump Administration directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rule making to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. In September 2020, the EPA finalized amendments to the 2016 standards that removed the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. However, President Biden signed an executive order on his first day in office calling for the suspension, revision, or rescission of the September 2020 rule and the reinstatement or issuance of methane emission standards for new, modified, and existing oil and gas facilities. Given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility, and several states have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas 
production activities. In November 2021, the EPA proposed new source performance standards and emissions guidelines to reduce methane and other pollution from new and existing sources in the oil and gas industry. The proposed rule would include, among other things, a comprehensive monitoring program for new and existing well sites, zero-emissions standards for new and existing pneumatic controls, and standards to eliminate venting of associated gas and requirements for the capture and sale of natural gas where a sales line is available. If adopted, these requirements could increase our costs to operate and control pollution. In November 2022, the EPA issued a Supplemental Proposal regarding the proposed new source performance standards and emissions guidelines for reducing methane and VOCs in the oil and natural gas sector. The Supplemental Proposal expands the November 2021 proposal to include more comprehensive requirements to reduce emissions, including application of methane monitoring obligations to wellhead-only sites and well sites with low emissions. It also would create a new third-party monitoring program to flag large emissions events known as the “Super-Emitter Response Program.” The EPA expects to finalize its new methane rules in 2023. The foregoing laws, regulations, and standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Until these rules are formally adopted, we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”). The IRA allocated $1.55 billion to the Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program. The IRA also required the EPA to implement a waste emission charge on methane emitted from applicable oil and gas facilities that exceed certain thresholds. The methane charge goes into effect in 2024 at $900 per metric ton of methane and increases to $1,500 per metric ton of methane by 2026. The charge will act as an incentive for operators to reduce emissions by minimizing leaks and replacing equipment rather than paying for excessive emissions. 
In November 2022, the Department of the Interior announced a proposed rule from the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) that would impose additional requirements on oil and natural gas production on federal and Tribal lands, including the use of “low bleed” pneumatic equipment and vapor recovery for oil storage tanks, implementation of leak detection plans, implementation of waste minimization plans, and monthly limits on royalty-free flaring. If adopted, these rules could adversely affect our production of oil and gas pursuant to federal leases in New Mexico.
In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone. In December 2020, the EPA announced its intention to leave the ozone NAAQS unchanged at 70 parts per billion rather than lower them further. However, as discussed above, that action could be subject to reversal following the Biden Administration’s January 2021 executive order. In mid-2022, the Biden Administration announced that it was considering designating the Permian Basin in Texas as a “non-attainment zone,” which, if designated, would result in increased permitting and compliance requirements for drilling operations in the state to decrease ozone levels. The Biden Administration has since omitted the potential designation from an agenda of planned regulations, indicating that it is not expected to be finalized in the next year. The EPA, however, could revive the effort in the future. In 2022, the New Mexico Environment Department (“NMED”) adopted “ozone precursor rules.” The ozone precursor rules went into effect on August 5, 2022 and apply to oil and gas sources in New Mexico that would cause or contribute to ambient ozone concentrations that exceed 95% of the NAAQs for ozone. As of the effective date, these rules apply to oil and natural gas production in the following counties in New Mexico: Chaves, Dona Ana, Eddy, Lea, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, San Juan, and Valencia. The rules apply to certain crude oil and natural gas production and processing equipment associated with operations. Reclassification of areas of state implementation of NAAQS, or designation of areas in which we operate as non-attainment zones, could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay, or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Moreover, the NMOCD recently adopted new rules, which require oil and gas operators to capture 98 percent of their methane waste by the end of 2026. The new rules went into effect on May 25, 2021. While the State of Texas has not formally conducted a recent rulemaking related to air emissions, scrutiny of oil and natural gas operations and the rules affecting them have increased in recent years. For example, the EPA and environmental non-governmental organizations have conducted flyovers with optical gas imaging cameras to survey emissions from oil and natural gas production facilities and transmission infrastructure. In August 2022, for example, the EPA announced that it would be conducting helicopter flyovers of the Permian Basin region in New Mexico and Texas. The flyovers used infrared cameras to survey oil and gas operations to identify large emitters of methane and VOCs. Based on data obtained during flyovers, EPA intends to initiate enforcement follow up actions with facilities operators. In addition, the RRC has increased oversight related to flaring, with reporting reviews and site inspections. While none of these activities increases our compliance obligations, they signal the potential for increased enforcement and possible rulemaking in the future.
Climate Change
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs endanger public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish construction and 
operating permit reviews for GHG emissions certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the Department of Transportation (the “DOT”), implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is an agreement, the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” for nations to limit their GHG emissions through non-binding, individually determined reduction goals every five years after 2020.The United States rejoined the Paris Agreement in February 2021. In early 2021, the Biden Administration issued a moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters to reduce emissions. Since then, the moratorium has been the subject of litigation and, in August 2022, a federal judge entered an injunction against the moratorium. In November 2021, the United States participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom (“COP26”). COP26 resulted in a pact among approximately 200 countries, including the United States, called the Glasgow Climate Pact. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced the launch of the “Global Methane Pledge,” which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. In conjunction with COP26, the United States committed to an economy-wide target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Also in November 2021, President Biden signed a $1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill into law. The new infrastructure law includes several climate-focused investments, including upgrades to power grids to accommodate increased use of renewable energy and expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure. The above-referenced IRA allocated $369 billion to energy and climate initiatives. In November 2022, the United States participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt (“COP27”). Although it is not possible at this time to predict what additional domestic legislation may be adopted in light of the Paris Agreement or the Glasgow Climate Pact, or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted based on the Paris Agreement or the Glasgow Climate Pact to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, limiting emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations, or restricting federal leases could impair our production, could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, and could decrease demand for oil and natural gas.
Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. For example, the New Mexico Environment Department has adopted regulations to restrict the venting or flaring of methane from both upstream and midstream operations.
Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.
There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.
The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas. In early 2023, for example, legislators in New Mexico introduced a bill that, if enacted, would significantly revise the state’s 1935 Oil & Gas Act by, among other things, removing the $250,000 cap on “blanket bonds” that oil and gas operators put up as financial assurance to plug and clean wells, establishing setbacks for oil and gas operations near certain communities, and establishing an environmental justice advisory council. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in us restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or having an impaired ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition and results of operation. We also are aware that the SEC intends to propose new and additional rules regarding company disclosure of climate change risk. We will monitor and comply with any such promulgated rules.
Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds and natural resources
Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”) and the Clean Water Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. As a result of a 2011 settlement agreement, the FWS was required to determine whether to identify more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by no later than completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The FWS missed the deadline but reportedly continues to review new species for protected status under the ESA pursuant to the settlement agreement. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and natural gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the MBTA. Recently, there have been renewed calls to review protections currently in place for the dunes sagebrush lizard, whose habitat includes portions of the Permian Basin, and to reconsider listing the species under the ESA. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species or that may attract migratory birds, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA and the MBTA, and we are not aware of any proposed ESA listings that will materially affect our operations. Nevertheless, we are monitoring listings and proposed listings by the FWS to ensure continued compliance. In November 2022, FWS listed the southern distinct population segments of the lesser prairie-chicken that occupy habitats in eastern New Mexico and the southwest Texas Panhandle. In January 2023, FWS listed the Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly in New Mexico. The federal government in the past has issued indictments under the MBTA to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. In January 2020, a new U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”) rule went into effect clarifying that only the intentional taking of protected migratory birds is subject to prosecution under the MTBA. In December 2021, however, that rule was revoked, and a new rule took effect reinstating the prohibition on incidental takes under the MTBA. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our oil and natural gas reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
Hazard communications and community right to know
We are subject to federal and state hazard communication and community right to know statutes and regulations. These regulations, including, but not limited to, the federal Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act, govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances and may require that information be provided to state and local government authorities, as well as the public.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
State Regulation
Texas and New Mexico regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas and New Mexico currently impose a severance tax on oil production of 4.6% and 3.75%, respectively, and a severance tax on natural gas and natural gas liquid production of 7.5% and 3.75%, respectively. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowable from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure our stockholders that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill.
The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
Related Insurance
We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration, development and production activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site, and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2022, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2023.
Human Capital Management
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 219 full-time employees, of which 13 are management, 62 are technical personnel, 37 are administrative personnel and 107 are field operations employees. Our employees are not covered under a collective bargaining agreement nor are any employees represented by a union. We consider all relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Health and Safety
The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, contractors, and everyone impacted by our operations is of paramount importance to all of us at Earthstone. We believe that it is our responsibility to employ best practices for safety procedures and provide a safe workplace, as well as strive to ensure that each and every one of our employees and contractors understands the importance of the role each plays in maintaining a safe work environment. Through leadership and commitment to training, safety has become imbedded in our culture and is a critical component of our success.
Our contractors and vendors are held to the same high safety standards that we require of employees. As part of this mandate, we monitor these partners to make certain that proper procedures are maintained and that contractors comply with regulatory requirements and guidelines.
In response to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to monitor and take seriously the guidelines of health experts and are adhering to the highest possible standards issued by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) as well as governments and regulators across our areas of operations. We have implemented a number of measures to safeguard the health of our employees, contractors and the community, while continuing to operate responsibly and maintaining the resiliency of the Company.
Our focus on health and safety is demonstrated by zero employee lost time incidents due to injuries at the workplace in each of 2020, 2021 and 2022. 
Our Culture
At Earthstone, we know that our people drive our success, and we are committed to providing a rewarding and productive work environment and a culture of respect for our employees. We believe in fostering an inclusive culture to ensure the strength and resilience of our business. Our Code of Ethics, which applies to our directors, officers and employees when they are acting on our behalf, reinforces our long-standing commitment to high ethical standards and summarizes the fundamental importance of acting with integrity. We value the perspectives, experiences and ideas contributed by all employees and pledge to foster their professional growth by embracing the following principles:

•Respect for others, the community and environment is valued

Compensation and Benefits
Our success is based on financial performance and operational results, and we believe that our compensation program is an important driver of that success. The primary objectives of our compensation program are to pay for performance, encourage long-term shareholder value, encourage profitable growth in our oil and natural gas reserves and production, encourage growth in cash flow and profitability, survive and preserve value and upside potential for shareholders during industry and economic downturns, and mitigate risks in our business related to compensation by balancing fixed compensation with short-term and long-term performance-based incentive compensation. Further, we operate in a highly competitive and challenging environment and must retain, attract and motivate talented individuals with the requisite technical and managerial skills to successfully pursue our business strategy. To accomplish this, our compensation program is designed to reward employees for their performance and motivate them to continue to perform at a high level through both absolute and relative performance assessment. 
We provide our employees with a comprehensive compensation program. We provide a competitive base salary as a fixed component of our compensation program. The annual cash payment is our short-term incentive for eligible employees, which reinforces both corporate and individual annual performance and prioritizes both financial and operational metrics. Eligible employees may also receive long-term incentives in the form of restricted stock unit awards and performance restricted stock unit awards that vest over multiple years to support retention and align employee interests with those of our stockholders, by driving value at the enterprise level. We provide market-competitive pay levels to attract and retain the highly qualified talent. We regularly benchmark each component of our compensation program to ensure we remain competitive. All employees may participate in our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan.
