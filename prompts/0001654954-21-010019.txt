 Item 1.    Business.
  
  General
 
  Our Company
  
  LightPath Technologies, Inc. (“LightPath”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) was incorporated under Delaware law in 1992 as the successor to LightPath Technologies Limited Partnership, a New Mexico limited partnership formed in 1989, and its predecessor, Integrated Solar Technologies Corporation, a New Mexico corporation formed in 1985. Today, LightPath is a global company with major facilities in the United States, the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Latvia.
 Subsidiaries
  
  In November 2005, we formed LightPath Optical Instrumentation (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (“LPOI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, located in Jiading, People’s Republic of China. The LPOI facility (the “Shanghai Facility”) is primarily used for sales and support functions.
  
  In December 2013, we formed LightPath Optical Instrumentation (Zhenjiang) Co., Ltd. (“LPOIZ”), a wholly-owned subsidiary located in the New City district, of the Jiangsu province, of the People’s Republic of China. LPOIZ’s manufacturing facility (the “Zhenjiang Facility”) serves as our primary manufacturing facility in China and provides a lower cost structure for production of larger volumes of optical components and assemblies. Late in fiscal 2019, this facility was expanded from 39,000 to 55,000 square feet to add capacity for polishing to support our growing infrared business.
  
 In December 2016, we acquired ISP Optics Corporation, a New York corporation (“ISP”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ISP Optics Latvia, SIA, a limited liability company founded in 1998 under the Laws of the Republic of Latvia (“ISP Latvia”). ISP is a vertically integrated manufacturer offering a full range of infrared products from custom infrared optical elements to catalog and high-performance lens assemblies. Historically, ISP’s Irvington, New York facility (the “Irvington Facility”) functioned as its global headquarters for operations, while also providing manufacturing capabilities, optical coatings, and optical and mechanical design, assembly, and testing. In June 2019, we completed the relocation of this manufacturing facility to our existing facilities in Orlando, Florida and Riga, Latvia. ISP Latvia is a manufacturer of high precision optics and offers a full range of infrared products, including catalog and custom infrared optics. ISP Latvia’s manufacturing facility is located in Riga, Latvia (the “Riga Facility”).

  Industry
 
  We and our customers support a wide range of industries, including automotive, telecommunications, defense, medical, bio-technology, industrial, consumer goods and more. A commonality among these industries is the use of photonics as an enabling technology in their products. 
 
  Over the last ten years we have witnessed a pivotal shift in the adoption of photonics in new applications. In the early days of the photonics industry the technology was a specialty, which was both expensive and required highly specialized technical knowledge, leading to low adoption of the technology into industries other than defense and high-end medical applications. Starting with the commercialization of fiber optic communication, and further driven by significant cost reduction in key technologies such as sensors and lasers, the adoption of the technology into more industries and applications began rapidly growing.  According to the National Academy of Sciences Report: Optics & Photonics: Essential Technologies for our Nation, the value of light-enabled products and services is estimated to be between $7 trillion and $10 trillion annually, representing 11% of the world’s economy. 
  
  With the accelerated rate of adoption and highly diversified industries and applications utilizing an expanding array of photonics technologies, comes a change in both the needs of the customers and the supply chain, to support those needs.  In the past, we and other component suppliers mostly served customers that specialized in photonics.  The needs of the large OEMs were focused on relying on component companies as their supply chain for optical parts and minor fabrication and assemblies.  Accordingly, the supply chain was fragmented and consisted of a large number of small companies, often with specific specialties in the fabrication process. OEMs typically produced their own designs and relied on the supply chain to fulfill their needs absent any product planning or collaboration.   
 
  As the industry has evolved and sensory, visualization and imaging capabilities have become differentiators, if not a necessity for an expanding array of products in myriad industries, the specialized requirements of customers are no longer being adequately addressed. With the wider adaptation of the technology, and with customers that now possess different expertise in different technologies, the needs are different, such is often the case with a mature supply chain. In our case, the change translates to now serving OEM customers for whom photonics is one of several technologies they embed into their product. That is, a limited number of OEMs have been transitioning from relying on a distributed supply chain that would provide all components for the bill of materials (“BOM”) to a highly diversified and fragmented global customer base in which the optical parts of their system are only a part of multiple technologies integrated together. As a result, the expanding market of original equipment and end market manufacturers are increasingly requiring an ecosystem around them to support their needs for domain knowledge, design, assembly and supply of their optical needs. We refer to this ecosystem as optical engineered solutions.  We are uniquely positioned to serve as a single, global solutions provider with leading engineering and manufacturing capabilities. This has led to the development of a new strategy and organizational alignment, discussed below, which we have begun to implement in recent months, with significant initial success, including a return to double digit annual revenue growth, multiple new product designs and key multinational customer contract wins.
 
  Growth Strategy
 
  Historically, we operated with a focus on optical component manufacturing, and specifically on our leadership position as a precision molded lens manufacturer for visual light applications. While still positioned as a component provider, we expanded our addressable market with the acquisition of ISP, a manufacturer of infrared optical components, in December 2016.  Collectively, our operations lacked synergies, maintained a high cost structure, and lacked a defined path for capitalizing on the industry’s evolution and growth opportunities.
 
  In March of 2020, our Board of Directors (our “Board”) recruited Mr. Sam Rubin, an industry veteran with a proven track record for delivering high growth through organic and inorganic means, to assume the role of Chief Executive Officer and to develop and implement a new strategy going forward.  In the fall of 2020, Mr. Rubin led our Board and the leadership team in collaborative discussions with the purpose of defining a new comprehensive strategy for our business. The collaborative strategic planning process included leaders from across the organization, detailed dialogs with customers, vendors and partners, and an in-depth analysis of the environment we are in, changes and trends in and around the use of photonics, and an analysis of our capabilities, strengths and weaknesses. Throughout the process, we focused on developing a strategy that creates a unique and long-lasting value to our customers, and utilizes our unique capabilities and differentiators, both existing capabilities and differentiators, as well as new capabilities we acquire and develop organically.
 
  Understanding the shifts that are happening in the marketplace, and the changes that come when a technology like photonics moves from being a specialty, to being integrated into mainstream industries and applications, we redefined our strategic direction to provide our wide customer base with domain expertise in optics, and become their partner for the optical engine of their system. In our view, as the use of photonics evolves, so do the needs evolve. The industry is transforming from a fragmented industry with many component manufacturers into a solution focused industry, with the potential for partnerships for solution development and production.  We believe such a partnership starts with us, as the supplier. We have in-house domain expertise in photonics, knowledge and experience in the most advanced technologies and the necessary manufacturing techniques. We can then further develop these partnerships by working closely with the customer throughout their design process, designing an optical solution that is tailored to their needs, often times using unique technologies we own, and supplying the customer with the corresponding complete optical subsystem to be integrated into their product.  Such an approach builds on our unique, value-added technologies that we both currently own, such as optical molding, fabrication, and system design along with other technologies we may acquire or develop in the future to create tailored solutions for our customers, which often are based on proprietary manufacturing technologies. 
 
  Providing the domain expertise and the extensive “know how” in optical design, fabrication, production and testing technologies will allow our customers to focus on their own development efforts, without needing to develop subject matter expertise in optics. By providing the bridge into the optical solution world, we partner with our customers on a long-term basis, create value to our customers, and capture that value through the long-term supply relationships we develop.

  Organizational Alignment

  Along with the development of a new strategic direction, we are focused on the execution of this strategic plan.  First, we aligned the organization to the strategic plan. Such alignment has been ongoing in all levels of the organization, starting at the leadership level through the creation of the role of Vice President of Operations through the hiring of Peter Grief, and the hiring of a new Chief Financial Officer, Albert Miranda, upon the retirement of our former officer. We also appointed a new director to our Board, S. Eric Creviston, who has extensive experience with wireless and mobile technology and the semiconductor industry. We believe that the addition of our new Vice President of Operations, an expert at building and scaling manufacturing operations, and our new Chief Financial Officer with strong experience in financial management and mergers and acquisitions in the optical industry, will allow us to now focus on building a strong foundation that is aligned to our strategic plan, and create an operation that will be ready to take on significant growth, both organic and inorganic.  
 
  To execute our new strategic plan, we also need, among other things, a strong manufacturing organization, as well as a technical organization that provides the domain expertise in photonics, from the design of an optical engineered solution tailored for the customer’s needs, through the manufacturing, assembly and testing of such a sub-system. Given the fast pace of advancements in photonics technologies, achieving a sustainable advantage will also depend on having unique capabilities and technologies that allow our team to design and deliver the best tailored solutions.  To support those goals, we began a few different organization-wide efforts, starting from standardizing and optimizing our processes and systems, through alignment of organizational structure, such as separating what used to be one combined engineering group into the engineering functions that are part of operations, and a new product development group that focuses on developing capabilities and technologies that allow us to design and deliver better solutions. By having a small, focused new product development group, we are able to develop unique technologies that allow us to design solutions that we believe are better than what is otherwise available. Such unique technologies include developing tailored and optimized optical coatings, and advanced fabrication techniques such as freeform optical components, custom materials not available elsewhere, and cutting edge optical design capabilities.
 
  In the longer term, we have identified capabilities and technologies that could be important differentiators, including, for example, optical detectors and active optical components such as lasers, motion systems, and more. The collection of many such unique technologies is what will allow us to differentiate our optical solution, and provide the customer with a product that is tailored exactly to their needs.   
 
  In addition to all of the organizational alignment initiatives we are implementing, we have also had a leadership transition and operational enhancements at our Chinese subsidiaries. As discussed in more detail in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we terminated certain of our management employees at our Chinese subsidiaries, LPOIZ and LPOI, and transitioned to new management personnel. These events adversely impacted domestic sales in China, but we expect these impacts to lessen in the first half of fiscal 2022.
  
  Technologies
  
  We believe that to be the preferred partner for the photonics needs of our customers, domain expertise in photonics is the key element. Optics and photonics require multidisciplinary skills, including physics, mechanical engineering, material sciences, electrical engineering, chemistry, among others. This is part of what makes using photonics so complicated, and at the same time part of what we see as the opportunity. Knowing what can and cannot be produced, designing the architecture and detailed design of the optical system, including electrical and mechanical interfaces, choosing and executing the best manufacturing technology, and delivering both the engineering prototypes that are needed, as well as long-term producing a high volume of goods, are all part of the domain expertise required. Additionally, to design the best solution for a customer, we not only need to know what can be produced and how to design it, we also must have unique capabilities that differentiate our solutions and allow us to design and produce a better solution that is more profitable than what may otherwise be available.
  
  Along those lines, we continue to focus on developing new, innovative capabilities and technologies in all of our engineering and manufacturing groups, including systems design and testing, optical fabrication of components, material production, optical coatings, and electro mechanical design and production.

  Among the manufacturing technologies we own are:
  
   ●
 High precision molded lenses. Historically, precision molding of lenses is the key technology we built upon. Precision molding of optics is a unique technology that is well suited for both high volume production of optical components, as well as production of optics with unique shapes, which otherwise would require a very lengthy and complex process, to individually polish each lens to shape. Precision molded optics, or PMOs, is a technology we continuously invest in, pushing the envelope further on what materials can be molded and the shapes and sizes of the optics we can mold. Although there are several other competitors that can mold optical elements, we have an established leadership position in this area, as the original developer of the technology, and we believe we are the preferred vendor for the most complex, high-end projects of many of our customers. Some recent advancements we have made in precision molded optics include molding of non-symmetric shapes such as freeform optical components, and qualifying new materials for availability as moldable materials.

   ●
 Traditional polishing, and diamond turned optics. Through the acquisition of ISP in fiscal 2017, we added to our capabilities a wide range of traditional fabrication processes. These include CNC grinding and polishing of optical elements, traditional grind and polishing of lenses, and diamond turning of infrared materials

   ●
 Materials. Materials play an important role in providing design flexibility and allow tradeoffs between optical performance, weight, and performance in varying conditions. Traditionally, infrared applications have only a small number of materials, all of which are crystal based. However, the introduction of synthetic Chalcogenide glass in recent years, which allows for synthesizing of different materials, has created a larger library of materials to design with. We produce four materials: BD6, our flagship Chalcogenide glass; (ii) BD2 which we have been producing for over 15 years; (iii) NaCl and (iv) KBr crystals. We believe that having a larger selection of optical materials will provide us more tools to design better solutions than exists with current materials, and we plan to continue to invest in our materials development. In addition, through a grant from Space Florida foundation and Israel’s ministry of science, we plan to qualify our Chalcogenide glass for space applications and in particular thermal imaging from space, which is a fast-growing application

   ●
 Optical coatings. Thin film coatings are designed to reduce losses and protect the optical material, which are a key part of any optical system. Through our recent investments, we have the ability to coat lenses in all of our facilities, providing efficient, high quality antireflective coatings, as well as reflective and protective coatings. Our coating facilities employ both physical vapor deposition techniques as well as chemical vapor deposition techniques. In addition to our library of dozens of standard coatings, our coating engineers often design coatings specific for an application, optimizing the performance of the system for a specific customer use. One of our most known advanced coatings is DLC, or Diamond Like Carbon, which provides materials such as chalcogenide glass significant environmental protection. This coating is currently available only at a small number of vendors, and is an example of a capability that provides us the ability to design better optical solutions.

   ●
 Assembly and testing. In recent years we have invested significantly in capabilities for sub-system level assemblies and testing in two of our facilities. Even more recently, we have added capabilities of active alignment, and extended testing including environmental testing, to support our growing business of optical assemblies and engineered solutions. We expect to continue to invest in this area as activity grows, and in particular in volume manufacturing and testing of assemblies.

 
  New Product Development
  
  In connection with our new strategic direction, to leverage our subject matter expertise and provide customers with the optical sub-system to integrate into their product, our development efforts during fiscal 2021 also shifted to focus on developing products, technologies and capabilities that allow us to provide better solutions, using the most fit technology for each customer and with alignment to customer product lifecycle. This includes developing unique materials, processing techniques, optical coating offerings and more, which allow us to design a better optical system for a customer than it could obtain elsewhere or through its in-house/captive capabilities. Examples of such development efforts include new and unique optical coatings, advanced materials that provide more flexibility in design, qualifying our materials and processes for specific environments such as our recently announced project to develop thermal imaging optics for use in space, and more. Where possible we apply for patents for the technology we develop, though in many cases the protection a patent offers is diminished by the need to disclose in detail the processes, and so we apply for patents only in cases when we believe the patent is enforceable and does not compromise our trade secrets and intellectual properties developed over three decades.
  
  We incurred expenditures for new product development during fiscal 2021 and 2020 of approximately $2.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
  
  In some cases our product and technology development is supported through billing of engineering services, such as non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) fees. In other cases we receive external funding, such as our recently announced funding from the Space Florida Foundation. In some cases, our efforts are self-funded.
  
  As part of our product development and research and development efforts, we have over 50 employees with engineering and related advanced degrees located in our facilities throughout the world. Our facilities in Orlando, Florida and Zhenjiang, China are located in or near industrial technology campuses with substantial access to optical industry constituencies, including a major university. This enables us and our staff to remain on the cutting edge of industry design trends and to enter into collaborative engagements.

  Product Groups and Markets 
 
  Overview
  
  Our business is organized into three product groups: PMOs, infrared products and specialty products. These product groups are supported by our major product capabilities: molded optics, thermal imaging optics, and custom designed optics.
  
  Our PMO product group consists of visible precision molded optics with varying applications. Our infrared product group is comprised of infrared optics, both molded and diamond-turned, and thermal imaging assemblies. This product group also includes both conventional and CNC ground and polished lenses. Between these two product groups, we have the capability to manufacture lenses from very small (with diameters of sub-millimeter) to over 300 millimeters, and with focal lengths from approximately 0.4 millimeters to over 2000 millimeters. In addition, both product groups offer both catalog and custom designed optics.
  
  Our specialty product group is comprised of value-added products, such as optical subsystems, assemblies, and collimators, and NRE products, consisting of those products we develop pursuant to product development agreements that we enter into with customers. Typically, customers approach us and request that we develop new products or applications for our existing products to fit their particular needs or specifications. The timing and extent of any such product development is outside of our control.
  
  Product Groups
  
  Beginning in late 2019, we implemented a product management function, with a product manager for each of our major product capabilities: molded optics, thermal imaging optics and custom designed optics. Product management is principally a portfolio management process that analyzes products within the product capability areas as defined above. This function has begun to facilitate choosing investment priorities to help strategically align our competencies with strategic industry revenue opportunities. Over the longer term, this function will also help ensure successful product life cycle management. The following further discusses the various products we offer and certain growth opportunities we anticipate for each such product.
  
  PMO Product Group. Aspheric lenses are known for their optimal performance. Aspheric lenses simplify and shrink optical systems by replacing several conventional lenses. However, aspheric lenses can be difficult and costly to machine. Our glass molding technology enables the production of both low and high volumes of aspheric optics, while still maintaining the highest quality at an affordable price. Molding is the most consistent and economical way to produce aspheres and we have perfected this method to offer the most precise molded aspheric lenses available.
  
  Infrared Product Group. Our infrared product group is comprised of both molded and turned infrared lenses and assemblies using a variety of infrared glass materials. Advances in chalcogenide materials have enabled compression molding for mid-wave, or MWIR, and long-wave, or LWIR, optics in a process similar to precision molded lenses. Our molded infrared optics technology enables high performance, cost-effective infrared aspheric lenses that do not rely on traditional diamond turning or lengthy polishing methods. Utilizing precision molded aspheric optics significantly reduces the number of lenses required for typical thermal imaging systems and the cost to manufacture these lenses. Molding is an excellent alternative to traditional lens processing methods particularly where volume and repeatability is required.
  
  Through ISP, our wholly-owned subsidiary, we also offer germanium, silicon or zinc selenide aspheres and spherical lenses, which are manufactured by diamond turning. This manufacturing technique allows us to offer larger lens sizes and the ability to use other optical materials that cannot be effectively molded. The capabilities we have from ISP give us the ability to meet complex optical challenges that demand more exotic optical substrate materials that are non-moldable, as well as larger size optics.

 Near the end of fiscal 2018, we announced comprehensive production capabilities and global availability for a new line of infrared lenses made from chalcogenide glass. We developed this glass and melt it internally to produce our Black Diamond glass, which has been trademarked, and is marketed as BD6. Historically, the majority of our thermal imaging products have been germanium-based, which is subject to market pricing and availability. BD6 offers a lower-cost alternative to germanium, which we expect will benefit the cost structure of some of our current infrared products and allow us to expand our product offerings in response to the markets’ increasing requirement for low-cost infrared optics applications.
  
  Overall, we anticipate growth for infrared optics, particularly as BD6 continues to be adopted into new applications and new designs. Infrared systems, which include thermal imaging cameras, temperature sensing, gas sensing devices, spectrometers, night vision systems, automotive driver awareness systems, such as blind spot detection, thermal weapon sights, and infrared counter measure systems, is an area that is growing rapidly and we are selling products that are utilized in a number of these applications. As infrared imaging systems become widely available, market demand will increase as the cost of components decreases. Our aspheric molding process is an enabling technology for the cost reduction and commercialization of infrared imaging systems utilizing smaller lenses because the aspheric shape of our lenses enables system designers to reduce the lens element in a system and provide similar performance at a lower cost. In addition, there is a trend toward utilizing smaller size sensors in these devices which require smaller size lenses and that fits well with our molding technology.
  
  Specialty Product Group. We offer a group of custom specialty optics products and assemblies that take advantage of our unique technologies and capabilities. These products include custom optical designs, mounted lenses, optical assemblies, and collimator assemblies. Collimator assemblies for applications involving light detection and ranging, or LIDAR, technology for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles, such as forklifts and other automated warehouse equipment. This continues to be an emerging market with long-term growth potential for us. We also expect growth from medical programs and commercial optical sub-assemblies.
  
  We design, build, and sell optical assemblies into markets for test and measurement, medical devices, military, industrial, and communications based on our proprietary technologies. Many of our optical assemblies consist of several products that we manufacture.
  
  In connection with our new strategic direction and the expanding portfolio of products and services, we are evaluating the ways in which we may optimize the financial reporting of our product groups.
  
  Sales and Marketing
  
  Marketing. Extensive product diversity and varying levels of product maturity characterize the optics industry. Product verticals range from consumer (e.g., cameras, cell phones, gaming, and copiers) to industrial (e.g., lasers, data storage, and infrared imaging), from products where the lenses are the central feature (e.g., telescopes, microscopes, and lens systems) to products incorporating lens components (e.g., 3D printing, machine vision, LIDAR, robotics and semiconductor production equipment) and communications. As a result, we market our products across a wide variety of customer groups, including laser systems manufacturers, laser OEMs, infrared-imaging systems vendors, industrial laser tool manufacturers, telecommunications equipment manufacturers, medical instrumentation manufacturers and industrial measurement equipment manufacturers, government defense agencies, and research institutions worldwide. Our marketing efforts include a global unification of our messaging with the use of online advertising, branding activities that utilize social media, our website and considerable direct marketing activities. As our focus shifts from the sale of components and standard products to being the partner for customized solutions, so do our marketing activities shift from a focus on technical aspects of the components to a focus on best practice use cases, the overall outcome from our solutions and user benefit. Our market messaging will look to inspire interest and engagement.
  
  Sales Model & Structure. To align the organization to better serve our new solution strategy and for  accountability of our key corporate objectives, we have made a number of organizational changes designed to ensure customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. First, our organizational structure, with the creation of a product management function, now enables the close coordination of supply with demand to help us leverage the expanded capabilities of our offerings and coordinate the development efforts of our broad portfolio of products. Second, in June 2020, we hired a Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing who is transitioning the organization business unit approach to a unified global direct sales team that is standardized on a problem solving, needs analysis sales process. In the fall of 2020, our direct sales team went through Sandler Training to shift their mindset, empower action and improve communication techniques. Then, in January 2021, we realigned the sales structure to also include a global business development function that is responsible for identifying and developing new customers, new market opportunities and association networking to evangelize the brand. In August 2021, we added technical program managers to better support the transition of our customized customer programs from prototype engineering to full scale manufacturing.  
  Trade Shows. We display our standard products, new innovation offerings and our overall portfolio of capabilities at a number of trade shows each year throughout North America, Europe and Asia. As a result of COVID-19, most of these trade shows were either cancelled or modified into virtual online exchanges. In 2021, we participated in several “virtual shows” including Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers Defense and Commercial Sensing and EPIC Photonics+. In August 2021, we participated in our first “in-person” event of 2021 as part of AUVSI XPONENTIAL held in Atlanta, Georgia that focused on the emerging technologies supporting autonomous vehicles, drome and robotics. In September 2021, we will exhibit “in-person” at the China International Optoelectronic Expo (“CIOE”) in Shenzhen.  This engagement strategy underscores our directive of broadening our base of customers for solutions and involvement with emerging markets. These trade shows, even when virtual, which we anticipate will be the norm for the remainder of 2021, provide us an opportunity to further expand our brand, network to enhance business relationships, and gain valuable insight with technology trends in addition to target industry direction.

  Competition
  
  Engineered Solutions
  
  The market for non-captive optical engineered solutions is emerging. As companies such as LightPath begin transitioning their offering from components to engineered solutions, we compete on several fronts:
  
   ●
 Engineered solutions companies. While there are not many, companies such as Excelitas Technologies Corp. and Jenoptik AG offer optical engineered solutions to the market, with a specific focus on solutions in visible and ultraviolet light bands, and with a vertical industry focus, such as life sciences and semiconductor systems.

   ●
 Engineering firms. Though less popular, in some cases customers prefer to work with engineering firms that provide design services, which then the customer productes or sub-contracts to third-party component manufacturers. Example of such companies are Lighthouse Imaging, LLC, Optikos Corporation, and Photon Engineering, LLC.

   ●
 In-house or captive design. The most common approach today is for customers to design the optical system internally by the OEM. This requires customers to have expertise in optical system and component design capabilities, along with knowledge of the most advanced available technologies, however limited the scope of their capabilities or the profitability of their solutions may be.

 
 
  Our key differentiator is our unique technologies that allow us to design better solutions.
  
  PMO Product Group. Our PMO products compete with conventional lenses and optical components manufactured from companies such as Asia Optical Co., Inc., Anteryon BV, Rochester Precision Optics, and Sunny Optical Technology (Group) Company Limited. Aspheric lens system manufacturers include Panasonic Corporation, Alps Electric Co., Ltd., Hoya Corporation, as well as other competitors from China and Taiwan, such as E-Pin Optical Industry Co., Ltd., and Kinik Company.
  
  Our aspheric lenses compete with lens systems comprised of multiple conventional lenses. Machined aspheric lenses compete with our molded glass aspheric lenses. The use of aspheric surfaces provides the optical designer with a powerful tool in correcting spherical aberrations and enhancing performance in state-of-the-art optical products. However, we believe that our optical design expertise and our flexibility in providing custom high-performance optical components at a low price are key competitive advantages for us over these competitors. An additional competitive advantage is our ability to switch production between different facilities in different continents. We do not depend on one facility and are able to move production in and out of China, which creates significant value by guaranteeing continuity of supply chain and adjusting to customers’ geographical preferences.
  
  Plastic molded aspheres and hybrid plastic/glass aspheric optics, on the other hand, allow for high volume production, but primarily are limited to low-cost consumer products that do not place a high demand on performance (such as plastic lenses in disposable or mobile phone cameras). Molded plastic aspheres appear in products that stress cost or weight as their measure of success over performance and durability. Our low-cost structure allows us to compete with these lenses based on higher performance and durability from our glass lenses at only a small premium in price. We do not compete in the market for plastic lenses unless a glass substitution presents a viable alternative.
  
  Infrared Product Group. Our infrared optical components compete with optical products produced by Janos Technology LLC, Ophir Optronics Solutions Ltd. (a subsidiary of MKS Instruments, Inc.), Clear Align, II-VI, Inc. and a variety of Eastern European and Asian manufacturers. Infrared optical components can be produced using several techniques. Historically, infrared optical components were produced only using traditional fabrication technologies, which later changed when diamond turning was introduced (a form of advanced CNC for optical materials), and most recently, with the adoption of synthetic chalcogenide glass, we began to precision mold infrared optical components, by leveraging our years of leadership and expertise in precision molding.  Being synthetically produced, chalcogenide glass, such as our proprietary BD6 material, have an inherently lower cost than crystalline materials such as Germanium. Additionally, glass such as our BD6 material provides further advantages, including a-thermal behavior, lower weight, and ability to produce high-volumes through precision molding, something traditional infrared materials cannot achieve, due to their crystal structure. In addition to molding lenses directly into finished form, we also developed and patented a process to mold large optical elements into near net shape, which offers a significant cost savings for components that cannot be produced directly from molding. All of this is related in part to our choice to vertically integrate, and produce our own chalcogenide glass, positioning us to create more technical advantages for our customers, by leveraging and optimizing our glass manufacturing to produce unique materials and better overall system performance.
  
  We believe that the market shift towards the use of synthetic materials in infrared products represents a significant opportunity for us, and we continue to invest in further pushing the limits of both molding of infrared components, as well as the glass manufacturing technology and products. We believe this process will create significant differentiators and value in this industry segment, and will further change the dynamics of this industry segment.
  
  Our molded infrared optics competes with products manufactured by Umicore N.V. (“Umicore”), Rochester Precision Optics, and a number of Asian and European manufacturers. We believe that leadership in glass molding technologies, our vertical integration by producing our own glass, and our continued investment in technology development in this area, coupled with our diverse manufacturing flexibility, and our manufacturing facilities located in Asia, Europe and North America are key advantages over the products manufactured by these competitors.

  Manufacturing
  
  Facilities. Our manufacturing is largely performed in our combined 38,000 square feet of production facilities in Orlando, Florida (the “Orlando Facility”), in LPOIZ’s combined 55,000 square feet of production facilities in Zhenjiang, China, and in ISP Latvia’s 23,000 square feet of production facilities in Riga, Latvia. LPOI sales and support functions occupy a 1,900 square foot facility in Shanghai.
  
  Our Orlando Facility and LPOIZ’s Zhenjiang Facility feature areas for each step of the manufacturing process, including coating work areas, diamond turning, preform manufacturing and a clean room for precision glass molding and integrated assembly. The Orlando and Zhenjiang Facilities include new product development laboratories and space that includes development and metrology equipment. The Orlando and Zhenjiang Facilities have anti-reflective and infrared coating equipment to coat our lenses in-house. ISP Latvia’s Riga Facility includes fully vertically integrated manufacturing processes to produce high precision infrared lenses and infrared lens assemblies, including crystal growth, CNC grinding, conventional polishing, diamond turning, assemblies and state of the art metrology. During fiscal 2021, we began adding infrared coating capabilities in the Riga Facility as well.
  
 We are routinely adding additional production equipment at our Orlando, Zhenjiang and Riga Facilities. In fiscal 2021, we added additional space in our Riga Facility, and also executed a lease agreement for additional space at our Orlando Facility, which we expect to occupy by late fiscal 2022. In addition to adding additional equipment or space at our manufacturing facilities, we add additional work shifts, as needed, to increase capacity and meet forecasted demand. We intend to monitor the capacity at our facilities, and will increase such space as needed. We believe our facilities and planned expansions are adequate to accommodate our needs over the next year.
  
  Production and Equipment.

  For more information regarding our facilities, please see Item 2. Properties in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
  
  Subcontractors and Strategic Alliances.  We believe that low-cost manufacturing is crucial to our long-term success. In that regard, we generally use subcontractors in our production process to accomplish certain processing steps requiring specialized capabilities. For example, we presently use a number of qualified subcontractors for fabricating, polishing, and coating certain lenses, as necessary. We have taken steps to protect our proprietary methods of repeatable high-quality manufacturing by patent disclosures and internal trade secret controls.
  
  Suppliers.  We utilize a number of glass compositions in manufacturing our molded glass aspheres and lens array products.  These glasses or equivalents are available from a large number of suppliers, including CDGM Glass Company Ltd., Ohara Corporation, and Sumita Optical Glass, Inc. Base optical materials, used in both infrared glass and collimator products, are manufactured and supplied by a number of optical and glass manufacturers. ISP utilizes major infrared material suppliers located around the globe for a broad spectrum of infrared crystal and glass. The development of our manufacturing capability for BD6 glass provides a low-cost internal source for infrared glass. We believe that a satisfactory supply of such production materials will continue to be available, at reasonable or, in some cases, increased prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

  We also rely on local and regional vendors for component materials and services such as housings, fixtures, chemicals and inert gases, specialty ceramics, UV and AR coatings, and other specialty coatings. In addition, certain products require external processing, such as anodizing and metallization. To date, we are not dependent on any of these manufacturers and have found a suitable number of qualified vendors and suppliers for these materials and services.
  
  We currently purchase a few key materials from single or limited sources. We believe that a satisfactory supply of production materials will continue to be available at competitive prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  Our policy is to protect our technology by, among other things, patents, trade secret protection, trademarks, and copyrights. We primarily rely upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how to protect certain process inventions, lens designs, and innovations. We have taken security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to the extent that is reasonable.
  
  We are aggressively pursuing patents for new products that provide new features, capabilities or other advantages to our customers. Over the past two years, we have been granted two new patents. We also have three remaining patents that relate to the fusing of certain of our lenses that are part of our specialty products group. These patents expire at various times through 2023. Since January 2021, we have also submitted three new disclosures of invention.
  
  Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Patent, trademark, and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or technology is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims.
  
  We own several registered and unregistered service marks and trademarks that are used in the marketing and sale of our products. The following table sets forth our registered and unregistered service marks and trademarks, if registered, the country in which the mark is filed, and the renewal date for such mark.

  Environmental and Governmental Regulation
  
  Currently, emissions and waste from our manufacturing processes are at such low levels that no special environmental permits or licenses are required. In the future, we may need to obtain special permits for disposal of increased waste by-products. The glass materials we utilize contain some toxic elements in a stabilized molecular form. However, the high temperature diffusion process results in low-level emissions of such elements in gaseous form. If production reaches a certain level, we believe that we will be able to efficiently recycle certain of our raw material waste, thereby reducing disposal levels. We believe that we are presently in compliance with all material federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits necessary for the operation of our business.
  
  We also utilize certain chemicals, solvents, and adhesives in our manufacturing process. We believe we maintain all necessary permits and are in full compliance with all applicable regulations.
  
  To our knowledge, there are currently no U.S. federal, state, or local regulations that restrict the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Certain end-user applications require government approval of the complete optical system, such as U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for use in endoscopy. In these cases, we will generally be involved on a secondary level and our OEM customer will be responsible for the license and approval process.
  
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, and their derivatives. Pursuant to these requirements, we are required to report on Form SD the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. We strive to only use suppliers that source from conflict-free smelters and refiners; however, in the future, we may face difficulties in gathering information regarding our suppliers and the source of any such conflict minerals.
  
Concentration of Customer Risk  
  In fiscal 2021, we had sales to three customers that comprised an aggregate of approximately 38% of our annual revenue with one customer at 18% of our sales, another customer at 10% of our sales, and the third customer at 10% of our sales. In fiscal 2020, we had sales to three customers that comprised an aggregate of approximately 31% of our annual revenue with one customer at 15% of our sales, another customer at 10% of our sales, and the third customer at 6% of our sales. The loss of any of these customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any such customer, would adversely affect our revenues and profits. We continue to diversify our business in order to minimize our sales concentration risk.
  
  In fiscal 2021, 68% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside of the U.S., with 95% of our foreign sales derived from customers in Europe and Asia. In fiscal 2020, 66% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside of the U.S., with 96% of our foreign sales derived from customers in Europe and Asia.
