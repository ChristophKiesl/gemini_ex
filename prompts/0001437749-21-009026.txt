ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1997 and is primarily a multi-channel retailer offering a “make your own stuffed animal” interactive retail-entertainment experience. As of January 30, 2021, we operated 354 corporately-managed locations, including 305 stores in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, 49 stores in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Ireland, and China and had 71 franchised stores operating internationally under the Build-A-Bear Workshop brand. In addition to our stores, we sold product on our company-owned e-commerce sites, third-party marketplaces and franchisee sites and through retailer’s wholesale agreements. There were also 56 locations through our "third-party retail" model in which we sell our products on a wholesale basis to other companies that then in turn execute our retail experience. Select corporately-managed franchised and third party retail locations were temporarily closed due to government mandates as well as our policy related to potential exposure at various times throughout fiscal 2020 as well as at the end of the fiscal year, and most locations operated with other restrictions, such as reduced operating hours and capacity restrictions and limitations.
COVID-19 Pandemic
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 was a global pandemic. The pandemic has had far-reaching adverse impacts on many aspects of our operation, directly and indirectly, including our people, consumer behavior, distribution, our suppliers, and the market generally, particularly in our first and second quarters of fiscal 2020. In the first half of the year, we rapidly responded to the onset of a global pandemic that forced a government-mandated temporary closure of all of our corporately-operated stores as well as many third party and franchise locations. We took immediate action to protect the financial well-being of the company including aggressive expense management and cash preservation while pivoting to driving e-commerce demand even as our headquarters staff shifted to working remotely. As we moved into the second half and stores reopened on a staggered basis as guidelines transitioned, our focus turned to accelerating key strategic initiatives to drive digital transformation and evolve retail. The strong growth from our e-commerce channel was the main contributor to revenue in the first half after the temporary store closures that occurred and the demand continued in the second half bolstering our second half revenue and profitability.
 
The scope and nature of these impacts on our business and financial performance are discussed in more detail throughout this report, including within Item 1. "Business", Item 1A. "Risk Factors, Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", and the footnotes to our financial statements included in Item 15. "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" below.
 
Segments and Geographic Areas
 
Our business is conducted through three reportable segments consisting of direct-to-consumer (“DTC”), commercial, and international franchising. Our reportable segments are primarily determined by the types of customers they serve and the types of products and services that they offer. Each reportable segment may operate in many geographic areas. Financial information related to our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate is contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See Note 15 — Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding sales, results of operations and identifiable assets of the Company by business segment and by geographic area.
Description of Operations
 
Currently, we primarily operate specialty stores that provide a “make your own stuffed animal” interactive entertainment experience in which guests, with the help of our associates, visit a variety of stations to “assemble” and customize a stuffed animal. Our concept is a unique combination of experience and product and we are focused on enhancing our brand equity while meeting the needs of consumers by offering a relevant selection of premium products that meet high quality standards and are on trend. In addition, products are sold through e-commerce sites, third-party retail locations, and franchisee sites. Our store experience appeals to a broad range of age groups and demographics, including children, as well as their parents and grandparents, teens, adult collectors and gift givers as well as affinity consumers. We seek to provide outstanding guest service and experiences across all channels and touch points including our stores, our e-commerce sites, our mobile sites and apps as well as traditional, digital and social media. Guests visit our stores for multiple reasons including interactive family experiences, birthdays, parties and other milestone occasions as well as to purchase gifts including the “gift of experience” that comes with a gift card. We believe the hands-on and interactive nature of our stores and high touch service model result in guests forming an emotional connection with our brand. 
 
We believe there are opportunities to leverage the strength of the Build-A-Bear brand to generate incremental revenue and profits given the high consumer recognition and strong positioning as a trusted, high quality brand that is emotionally connected with both kids and their parents as well as other teens and adults through expanded programs including outbound branded licensing and entertainment, which may positively impact other channels of distribution.

Operating Strategies
 
In fiscal 2020, after rapidly responding to the onset of a global pandemic in the fiscal first quarter, we continued to evolve and execute our strategic plan including accelerating key initiatives in the areas outlined below, which are intended to drive long-term shareholder value:
 
Further acceleration of our digital transformation including content and entertainment initiatives:
 
We continue to drive efforts to more effectively use technology and improve and enhance fulfillment capabilities while leveraging our expanded digital platforms to inform and drive marketing and content efforts in order to generate sales. This includes advancing our digital capabilities across the enterprise including our CRM (Customer Relations Management) programs with added technology combined with robust consumer data in order to efficiently acquire new consumers and drive lifetime value of existing guests, leveraging our over 10 million opted-in consumer database to increase engagement across social channels and through direct communications and using digital media, content and entertainment as marketing and brand-building tools to engage consumers and drive sales.
 
Rapidly evolving our retail capabilities which includes expanded e-commerce capabilities:
 
In the fall of 2017, we launched an upgraded e-commerce platform and have had double-digit or greater sales increases through this channel for every subsequent quarter following the launch. With increased digital demand, we have expanded our digital marketing and fulfillment capabilities to efficiently deliver the increase in order creation by adding diversified capability including improving warehouse throughput, developing buy online ship from store, pickup in store and curbside pickup options as well as partnering with services to provide same day delivery options from local store locations. In addition, we took actions to lower rent in brick-and-mortar store locations for both short- and long-term benefit by renegotiating over 90% of leases while continuing to maintain a high level of lease optionality with over 75% of stores maintaining an event in the next three years.
 
Maintaining financial stability and managing the liquidity needed to support our business while making strategic investments designed to drive future growth:
 
We remained focused on maintaining the liquidity needed to support our business including cash preservation and managing working capital as well as disciplined expense management while making strategic investments to upgrade our processes, systems and infrastructure with the goal of achieving long-term profitability improvement. In fiscal 2020, we finalized a five-year asset-based credit facility with PNC Bank.
 
Merchandise Sourcing and Inventory Management
 
Our stores and e-commerce sites offer an extensive and coordinated selection of merchandise, including a wide range of different styles of plush products to be stuffed, pre-stuffed plush products, sounds and scents that can be added to the stuffed animals and a broad variety of clothing, shoes and accessories, as well as other brand appropriate toy and novelty items, sourced from multiple vendors primarily in China and Vietnam. Our plush products and clothing are produced from high quality, man-made materials or natural fibers, and the stuffing is made of a high-grade polyester fiber.

We believe we comply with governmental toy safety requirements specific to each country where there are Build-A-Bear Workshop stores. Specifically, we believe all of the products sold in our stores and through our e-commerce sites meet Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) requirements including the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) for children’s products. We also believe we comply with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM-F963), European Toy Safety Standards (EN71), China National Toy Standards (GB6675/GB5296.5), China Compulsory Certification (CCC), Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 8124), Canadian Consumer Product Safety Act Toys Regulation (CCPSA), Chile Standard on Safety of Toys NCh 3251 and India Safety of Toys (IS:9873). Our products are tested through independent third-party testing labs for compliance with toy safety standards. Packaging and labels for each product indicate the age grading for the product and any special warnings in accordance with guidelines established by the CPSC or other applicable authority. We require our supplier factories to be compliant with the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) Ethical Toy Program certification or with other third-party social compliance programs. The ICTI Ethical Toy Program process is a social compliance program to promote ethical manufacturing in the form of fair labor treatment, as well as employee health and safety in the toy industry supply chain worldwide. In order to obtain this certification, each factory completes a rigorous evaluation performed by an accredited ICTI agent on an annual basis.
 
The average time from product conception to the arrival in stores is approximately 12 months, including approximately 90 to 120 days from the beginning of production to in-store delivery. Through an ongoing analysis of selling trends, we regularly update our product assortment by increasing quantities of productive styles and eliminating less productive styles. Our relationships with our vendors generally are on a purchase order basis without contractual obligation to provide adequate supply or acceptable pricing on a long-term basis.
 
As part of our disciplined approach to working capital and strong management of vendor relationships, as of January 30, 2021 our inventory balance decreased $6.4 million compared to February 1, 2020. While we are comfortable with the receipt flow, level, and composition of our inventory, we continue to manage our supply chain to mitigate logistics disruptions and delays in product shipments.
 
Distribution and Logistics
 
We own a 350,000 square-foot distribution center in Groveport, Ohio (near Columbus) that serves the majority of our stores in the United States and Canada. We also contract with a third-party warehouse in southern California to service our West Coast stores. The contract has a one-year term and is renewable. In Europe, we contract with a third-party distribution center in Selby, England under an agreement that ends in January 2025, to fulfill our store and e-commerce fulfillment needs. This agreement contains clauses that allow for termination if certain performance criteria are not met. In Asia, we contract with a third-party distribution center in Shanghai, China which is currently on a month-to-month extension while negotiations for an agreement are on-going.
 
Transportation from the warehouses to stores is managed by several third-party logistics providers. In the United States, Canada and Europe, merchandise is shipped by a variety of distribution methods, depending on the store and seasonal inventory demand. Shipments from our distribution centers are scheduled throughout the week in order to smooth workflow, and stores are grouped together by shipping route to reduce freight costs. All items in our assortment are eligible for distribution, depending on allocation and fulfillment requirements, and we typically distribute merchandise and supplies to each store once every other week or once a week on a regular schedule, which allows us to consolidate shipments in order to reduce distribution and shipping costs. Back-up supplies, such as stuffing for the plush animals, are often stored in limited amounts at regional pool points.
 
During fiscal 2020, we introduced "Buy Online, Ship From Store" and "Buy Online, Pick Up In Store" for orders placed in the United States and "Click and Collect" for orders placed in the United Kingdom. These programs allow our brick and mortar stores to operate essentially as small distribution centers allowing us to leverage the geographic proximity of stores, available inventory and labor to fulfill e-commerce demand.
 
On March 26, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of our warehouse and e-commerce fulfillment center in Ohio as we reviewed our processes related to workplace safety and assessed the scope of the Ohio statewide "stay at home" order, including social distancing and sanitation practices recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Ohio state health and regulatory authorities. The Ohio warehouse was reopened on April 1, 2020 following the review and reconfiguration of workflow and workspaces to further promote social distancing and minimize interaction as orders are fulfilled. With our guidance, our third-party warehouse in Selby, England implemented updated policies to comply with local social distancing guidelines.

Employees 
 
As of January 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,000 full-time and 2,700 regular part-time employees in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland and China. The number of part-time employees at all locations fluctuates depending on our seasonal needs. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 
As a result of COVID-19, on March 26, 2020 and the temporary closure of our corporately-managed stores, we announced the furlough of over 90% of our workforce and pay reductions of 20% for those employees not placed on temporary leave, including each of our named executive officers, both effective March 29, 2020. On October 6, 2020, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors authorized the return of base salaries to the amounts that were effective prior to the salary reductions for all employees, including our executive officers. The restoration of the base salaries was effective September 27, 2020 and was not retroactive to the date salaries were reduced in March 2020. As of January 30, 2021, the majority of our workforce in the United Kingdom and Ireland was furloughed as a result of all stores again being temporarily closed to comply with government mandates.
 
Competition
 
We view the Build-A-Bear Workshop store experience as a distinctive combination of entertainment and retail with limited direct competition. Since we develop proprietary products, we compete indirectly with a number of brands that sell stuffed animals or premium children’s toys in the United States, including, but not limited to, Ty, Fisher Price, Mattel, Ganz, Hasbro, Commonwealth and Vermont Teddy Bear. In the U.K., we compete with a number of retailers including The Entertainer Toy Shop, Smyths Toys Superstores and Hamleys toy stores. Since we sell a product that integrates merchandise and experience, we also view our competition as any company that competes for family time and entertainment dollars, such as movie theaters, amusement parks and arcades, other mall-based entertainment venues and online entertainment. With the majority of our stores currently operating in traditional shopping malls, we also compete with other mall-based retailers, including various apparel, footwear and specialty retailers, for prime mall locations.
 
We are aware of several small companies that operate “make your own” teddy bear and stuffed animal stores or kiosks in retail locations, but we believe none of those companies offer the breadth of assortment nor depth of experience or operate as a national or international retail company.
 
Intellectual Property and Trademarks 
 
We believe our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and similar intellectual property are critical to our success, and we intend, directly or indirectly, to maintain and protect these marks and, where applicable, license the intellectual property. Our patents do not expire until the years 2032 and 2033.
 
We have developed licensing and strategic relationships with leading retail and cultural organizations. We plan to continue to collaborate with companies that have strong, family-oriented brands and provide us with attractive marketing and merchandising opportunities. These relationships for specific products are generally reflected in contractual arrangements for limited terms that are terminable by either party upon specified notice. Specifically, we have key strategic relationships with select companies in which we feature their brands on products sold in our stores, including Disney®, NBCUniversal, Lucasfilm, Warner Bros., Nintendo, and major professional and collegiate sports along with other culturally relevant brands.
