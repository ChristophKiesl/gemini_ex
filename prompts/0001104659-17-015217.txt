Item 1.                   Business
Overview
 
We are an early-stage medical device company focused on commercializing the Aquadex FlexFlow® System.  Our commercial product, the Aquadex FlexFlow® System is indicated for temporary (up to eight hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy, and extended (longer than 8 hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and require hospitalization.
Company History
 
Prior to July 2016, we were focused on developing the C-Pulse® Heart Assist System for treatment of Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure. The C-Pulse System utilized the known concept of counterpulsation applied to the aorta.  In March 2016, we announced that we were no longer enrolling patients into our two clinical studies for the C-Pulse System and that we planned to pursue a new strategic direction. In July 2016, we announced that we were moving forward with a therapeutic strategy utilizing neuromodulation rather than counterpulsation.
 
In August 2016, we acquired the Aquadex Business from Baxter, a global leader in the hospital products and dialysis markets.
 
On September 29, 2016, we announced a strategic refocus of our near-term strategy that includes halting clinical evaluations of our neuromodulation technology to fully focus our resources on our recently acquired Aquadex Business, taking actions to reduce our cash burn in connection with such strategic refocus, and reviewing potential strategic alliances and financing alternatives.
 
The Aquadex FlexFlow System
 
The Aquadex FlexFlow is designed to simply, safely, and precisely remove excess fluid (primarily excess salt and water) from patients suffering from fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy. With the Aquadex FlexFlow, medical practitioners can specify and control the amount of fluid to be extracted at a safe, predictable, and effective rate. The Aquadex FlexFlow has been shown to have no clinically significant impact on electrolyte balance, blood pressure or heart rate. (1)
 
The Aquadex FlexFlow is indicated for temporary (up to 8 hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy; and extended (longer than 8 hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and require hospitalization. All treatments must be administered by a healthcare provider, under physician prescription, both of whom have received training in extracorporeal therapies.
 
Benefits of the Aquadex FlexFlow
 
The Aquadex FlexFlow ultrafiltration system offers a safe approach to treating fluid overload and:

·                  Provides complete control over rate and total volume of fluid removed by allowing a medical practitioner to specify the amount of fluid to be removed from each individual patient
 ·                  Aquapheresis therapy can be performed via peripheral or central venous access
 ·                  Removes isotonic fluid (extracts sodium while sparing potassium and magnesium)(2)
 ·                  Following ultrafiltration, neurohormonal activation is reset toward a more physiological condition and diuretic efficacy is restored (3)
 ·                  Provides highly automated operation with only one setting required to begin
 ·                  Utilizes a single-use, disposable auto-loading blood filter circuit that facilitates easy set-up
 ·                  The console guides medical practitioner through the setup and operational process
 ·                  Decreased hospital length of stay and readmissions (4)
 
The Aquadex FlexFlow system consists of:
 
·                  A console, a piece of capital equipment containing electromechanical pumps and an LCD screen
 ·                  A one-time disposable blood set (the Aquadex Blood Set ), an integrated collection of tubing, filter, sensors, and connectors that contain and deliver the blood from and back to the patient, and
 ·                  A disposable catheter (the Aquadex Catheter ), a small, dual-lumen catheter designed to access the peripheral venous system of the patient and to simultaneously withdraw blood and return filtered blood to the patient.  The Aquadex Blood Set is proprietary and the Aquadex FlexFlow can only be used with the Aquadex Blood Set. The Aquadex Catheter is often used in conjunction with the Aquadex FlexFlow, although it is one of many potential catheter options available to the provider.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and other developed countries. The American Heart Association estimates that 5.7 million people in the United States age 20 and over are affected by heart failure, with an estimated 870,000 new cases diagnosed each year and 670,000 emergency department visits. Congestive heart failure is the highest U.S. chronic health care expense category. (5)
 
Heart failure is a progressive disease caused by impairment of the left hearts ability to pump blood to the various organs of the body. Patients with heart failure commonly experience shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty exercising and swelling of the legs. The heart becomes weak or stiff and enlarges over time, making it harder for the left heart to pump the blood needed for the body to function properly. The severity of heart failure depends on how well a persons heart is able to pump blood throughout the body.
 
Heart failure is the leading cause of fluid overload, a condition where patients become decompensated resulting in lengthy and costly hospitalizations.  In fact, 90% of heart failure patients present symptoms of fluid overload. (6)  Our system is indicated for temporary (up to eight hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy, and extended (longer than 8 hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and require hospitalization.
 
According to a nationwide study of over 140,000 patients suffering from acute decompensated heart failure, over 38% of patients discharged were still symptomatic and about half of the patients were discharged with less than five pounds lost. (7) This clinical evidence from the ADHERE Registry clearly shows patients are discharged too early while still showing evidence of fluid overload. By not truly addressing the fluid overload problem, patients are being readmitted to the hospital too frequently with 30 day readmissions of 22% and 6-month readmissions of 44%, with 78% of patients admitted directly to the Emergency Department as the first point of care. (8) (9)
 
The Affordable Care Act includes a Hospital Readmission Reduction program and is designed to reduce payments to hospitals with excess heart failure readmissions, among other conditions. The penalty to hospitals can be significant, as much as 3% of total

Medicare reimbursement. The Aquadex FlexFlow is positioned to assist hospitals with the Affordable Care Act and may offer hospitals an economic benefit for using the device on a regular basis for in-patient or out-patient usage.
 
There are two market segments for treating fluid overload with the Aquadex FlexFlow:
 
1)             Inpatient Care  Given to a patient admitted to a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home or other facility. Long term care is the range of services typically provided at skilled nursing, intermediate-care, personal care or eldercare facilities.
2)             Outpatient Care  Any health care service provided to a patient who is not admitted to a facility. Outpatient care can be provided in a doctors office, clinic, or hospital outpatient department.
 
Our target customers for the Aquadex FlexFlow include large academic hospitals specializing in advanced treatment of chronic heart failure, other large hospitals with heart failure related admissions and clinical practices with transplant or LVAD programs.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leader in the treatment of moderate to severe heart failure and related conditions. We believe that our technology will provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for treating specific segments of heart failure patients.
 
On September 29, 2016, we announced a strategic refocus of our near term strategy that includes halting clinical evaluations of our neuromodulation technology to fully focus our resources on our recently acquired Aquadex Business, taking actions to reduce our cash burn in connection with such strategic refocus and reviewing potential strategic alliances and financing alternatives.
 
There is currently a large installed base of over 500 Aquadex FlexFlow consoles in U.S. hospitals that, once reactivated and reengaged, should enable increased utilization of the already installed console with ongoing purchases of the Aquadex Blood Sets.  In order to grow our Aquadex Business, we intend to focus our efforts in providing superior service to our customers through our direct field organization, our in-house customer service team, our technical service team, and our clinical education efforts. We are actively focused on strengthening our capabilities in all of these areas.
 
We are executing on our growth strategy in deliberate stages by:
 
·                  Initially focusing on the top 55 hospital accounts that generated eighty percent of the revenue for the Aquadex Business in 2015 through customer support and therapy development and by diagnosing each hospitals use of the Aquadex FlexFlow to gain additional opportunity for increased utilization.
 ·                  Expanding our efforts to re-engage the additional 110 hospital accounts that also purchased Aquadex Blood Sets in 2015.
 ·                  Re-educating customers to help increase the utilization of the Aquadex FlexFlow owned by an additional 200 hospital accounts prior to 2015.
 
Aquadex FlexFlow Growth Drivers
 
The Aquadex Business will benefit from re-engaging clients, targeting new customers and markets as well as positive industry dynamics favoring technologies that reduce hospital readmission rates.  We plan to reach these customers and markets by:
 
·                  Established Customer Base  Continuing to service the top 55 accounts producing 80% of the business with customer support and therapy development and diagnosing each hospitals use of Aquadex FlexFlow to gain additional opportunity for increased utilization.
 ·                  Enhancing the Outpatient Market  Continue supporting outpatient usage and expanding to include a registry and possible collaboration with payer/providers to allow greater opportunity in the future.
 ·                  International Opportunity  Currently, there is limited activity in Europe. Investigate use of distributors to expand usage of the Aquadex FlexFlow outside the United States.
 ·                  Differentiated Technology & Product Development  Work to enhance the current product to provide exceptional performance for our customers and patients.
 ·                  Alignment with Market Dynamics  Utilize existing and new data to demonstrate to hospital administrators that Aquadex FlexFlow can be a solution for 30-day readmissions and challenges with length of stay. Therefore, every Aquadex FlexFlow usage is economically advantageous driving increased demand.
 ·                  Reimbursement Opportunity  Work to build acceptance through clinical evidence and a registry to gain reimbursement coding for Aquapheresis therapy.

Sales and Marketing
 
As of March 1, 2017, we had 8 full-time employees in sales and marketing. During 2016, we trained our existing field personnel and hired additional sales personnel with prior experience with the Aquadex Business. Our sales force includes therapy development managers as well as field clinical engineers who provide training, technical and other support services to our customers. Since the acquisition of the Aquadex Business from Baxter in August 2016, our direct sales force has focused on reengaging hospital accounts that ordered Aquadex Blood Sets in prior years, re-educating customers on the therapy and diagnosing each hospitals use of the Aquadex FlexFlow to gain additional opportunity for increased utilization. We plan to grow the sales and marketing organization as necessary to support future growth.
 
Our sales representatives implement consumer marketing programs and provide physicians and nurses with educational patient materials. We also market to potential referral source clinicians in order to build awareness.
 
Clinical Experience
 
Several large-scale, multi-center, randomized, controlled trials have evaluated the use of ultrafiltration using the Aquadex FlexFlow in patients with acute decompensated heart failure compared to standard-of-care treatment with intravenous diuretics. These trials followed early-stage studies which primarily focused on safety of ultrafiltration treatment with Aquadex FlexFlow.
 
The UNLOAD trial enrolled 200 patients and showed that average weight and fluid loss were greater in the ultrafiltration group 48 hours following randomization. No differences were noted in symptoms of dyspnea between the groups. In addition, through 90 days of follow-up, the ultrafiltration group experienced fewer re-hospitalizations for heart failure, while renal function assessed by serum creatinine level was not significantly different between the groups.
 
The CARESS trial studied 188 randomized acute decompensated heart failure patients over the course of 96 hours and found no difference in weight loss and an increase in creatinine level relative to the control group treated with intravenous diuretics. The creatinine increase was interpreted as a sign of potential worsening renal function in the ultrafiltration group. Results of CARESS have been criticized on several grounds, particularly that trial results were impacted by centers unfamiliar with the use of ultrafiltration therapy and that the diuretic regimen employed was not representative of standard-of-care. In addition, a recent analysis of the DOSE trial to explore the putative link between short-term changes in creatinine level and outcome in acute decompensated heart failure has found that the intragroup difference observed in CARESS does not fall into a range associated with adverse long-term outcomes including death, re-hospitalization or visits to the emergency department. Such events were examined in CARESS over 60 days and no differences were detected between the groups.
 
Disparate results between UNLOAD and CARESS led to initiation of the AVOID trial. AVOID was designed to prospectively address the question of patient outcomes when treated with ultrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for acute decompensated heart failure. Trial design assumptions indicated that 810 patients would need to be randomized to achieve adequate statistical power. However, the study was terminated at 224 patients for business reasons by Baxter. Despite being underpowered, the results of AVOID indicated distinct trends toward reduced composite heart-failure events in the ultrafiltration group over 90 days. In addition, pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated significant reductions in heart failure re-hospitalization at 30 days. No significant differences were observed in creatinine level between the groups, although a trend toward increase may have been present at 48 hours. In totality, AVOID recapitulated the results of both UNLOAD and CARESS while providing evidence that had AVOID been followed to completion it would likely have met its primary endpoint of improved outcome in acute decompensated heart failure patients.
 
Other uses of ultrafiltration with the Aquadex FlexFlow have not been studied extensively. Case studies and case series demonstrating the use of ultrafiltration in the maintenance of outpatient chronic heart failure have been published but there has been no prospective, systematic evaluation of ultrafiltration versus standard-of-care for this population. Other potential uses also largely remain to be formally evaluated.
 
Research and Development
 
Research and development costs include activities related to research, development, design, testing and manufacturing of prototypes of the Aquadex FlexFlow. The Aquadex FlexFlow software will require periodic modifications for feature additions and performance improvements.  We will make such design changes as needed based on pro-active and reactive mechanisms.

Manufacturers and Suppliers
 
We are party to a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter which requires Baxter to manufacture Aquadex Blood Sets and Aquadex Catheters for a period of 18 months following our acquisition of the Aquadex Business.  There is no such agreement relating to the manufacturing of Consoles.  As an initial focus, we plan to transfer Console manufacturing to Sunshine Heart or a qualified contract manufacturer by mid-year 2017.  We plan to transfer the Aquadex Blood Set and Aquadex Catheter manufacturing activities from Baxter to Sunshine Heart or a qualified contract manufacturer by the end of 2017.
Intellectual Property
 
We have established an intellectual property portfolio through which we seek to protect our system and technology. As of December 31. 2017, our portfolio consisted of over 35 patents issued and 13 patents pending in the United States and abroad for our counterpulsation, technology. In addition, our portfolio includes over 50 exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patents with respect to ultrafiltration and the Aquadex system.  Finally, Sunshine Heart has two patents pending in the neuromodulation space. Our patents and patent applications cover various aspects of both the methodology as well as the design of our discontinued C-Pulse System device and related components, our discontinued neuromodulation technology, and the Aquadex FlexFlow.
 
We have developed technical knowledge that, although non-patentable, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with each of our employees and consultants prohibiting the disclosure of any confidential information or trade secrets. In addition, these agreements provide that any inventions or discoveries by employees and consultants relating to our business will be assigned to us and become our sole property.
 
Despite our patent rights and policies with regard to confidential information, trade secrets and inventions, we may be subject to challenges to the validity of our patents, claims that our system infringes the patent rights of others and the disclosure of our confidential information or trade secrets. These and other risks are described more fully under the heading Risk FactorsRisks Relating to our Intellectual Property.
 
At this time we are not a party to any material legal proceedings that relate to patents or proprietary rights.
 
Competition
 
Competition from medical device companies and medical device divisions of health care companies, pharmaceutical companies and gene- and cell-based therapies is intense and expected to increase. The vast majority of heart failure patients with fluid overload receive pharmacological treatment (diuretics) as a standard of care. There are no direct competitors in the U.S. other than diuretics. Other ultrafiltration systems, such as Baxters Prismaflex, a filter-based device approved for continuous renal replacement therapy for patients weighing 20kg or more with acute renal failure and/or fluid overload, represent indirect competitors.
 
Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish Aquadex FlexFlow from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:
 
·                  Financial resources;
 ·                  Product performance and design;
 ·                  Risk management;
 ·                  Product safety;
 ·                  Acceptance of our system in the marketplace;
 ·                  Sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;
 ·                  Manufacturing and assembly costs;
 ·                  Pricing of our system and of our competitors products;
 ·                  The availability of reimbursement from government and private health insurers;
 ·                  Success and timing of new product development and introductions;
 ·                  Regulatory approvals; and
 ·                  Intellectual property protection.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
In the United States, the Aquadex FlexFlow is purchased primarily by customers, such as hospitals or other health care providers. Customers bill various third-party payers for covered Aquadex FlexFlow services provided to patients. These payers, which include federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), state health care programs, private health insurance companies and
 
5




managed care organizations, would then reimburse our customers based on established payment formulas that take into account part or all of the cost associated with these devices and the related procedures performed.
 
While the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has not issued a favorable national coverage for ultrafiltration using the Aquadex FlexFlow, a number of private insurers have approved reimbursement for Aquadex FlexFlow for specific indications and points of service. In addition, patients and providers may see insurance coverage on a case-by-case basis.
 
We are exploring the ability to increase the range of coverage for uses of Aquadex FlexFlow, such as use in the outpatient setting and use for decompensated heart failure and other indicated uses under its approved labeling.
 
Legislative proposals can substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and may negatively impact payment rates for our system. Also, from time to time there are a number of legislative, regulatory and other proposals both at the federal and state levels; it remains uncertain whether there will be any future changes that will be proposed or finalized and what effect, if any, such legislation or regulations would have on our business. However, in the United States and international markets, we expect that both government and third-party payers will continue to attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged, or deny coverage, for health care products and services.
 
Government Regulations
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of our current system and any future products and in our ongoing research and development activities.  In particular, medical devices are subject to rigorous pre-clinical testing as a condition of approval by the FDA and by similar authorities in foreign countries.  Any proposed products will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
United States
 
The FDC Act and the FDAs implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance. Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA. The FDC Act, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions. We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries.
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and premarket approval (PMA). The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device - 510(k) clearance or PMA - is generally linked to classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the devices safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDAs current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation (QSR). Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed.
 
Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA. Class I and Class II devices that have not been exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA prior to commercial marketing. The PMA process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process.
 
510(k) Clearance.   To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial
 
6




equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
 
After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device). The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 
The Aquadex FlexFlow was granted FDA 510(k) clearance for commercial use on June 3, 2002.  Additional 510(k) clearances have been received for the Aquadex FlexFlow in subsequent years.
 
Clinical Trials.   To obtain FDA approval to market the C-Pulse System, clinical trials are required to support a PMA application. These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
 
FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the products safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as Good Clinical Practice. Good clinical practices include the FDAs IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigational devices. They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated. Good Clinical Practices also include the FDAs regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
 
Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
 
·                  the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial (or a change to a previously approved protocol or trial that requires approval), or place a clinical trial on hold;
 ·                  patients do not enroll in clinical trials or follow up at the rate expected;
 ·                  patients do not comply with trial protocols or experience greater than expected adverse side effects;
 ·                  institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol or changes to the trial protocol;
 ·                  third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreements, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements;
 ·                  third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;
 ·                  regulatory inspections of the clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require corrective action or suspension or termination of the clinical trials;
 ·                  changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;
 ·                  the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or
 ·                  the FDA concludes that the trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
 
Continuing Regulation.     After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 
7




·                  establishment registration and device listing upon the commencement of manufacturing;
 ·                  the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during medical device design and manufacturing processes;
 ·                  labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and promotional activities;
 ·                  medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if malfunctions were to recur;
 ·                  corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections; and
 ·                  product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
 
In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
 
·                  warning letters or untitled letters;
 ·                  fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
 ·                  product recall or seizure;
 ·                  unanticipated expenditures;
 ·                  delays in clearing or approving or refusal to clear or approve products;
 ·                  withdrawal or suspension of FDA approval;
 ·                  orders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund;
 ·                  operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production or clinical trials; or
 ·                  criminal prosecution.
 
We and our contract manufacturers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR.
 
The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Corporate Information
 
Sunshine Heart, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on August 22, 2002. We began operating our business in November 1999 through Sunshine Heart Company Pty Limited, which currently is a wholly owned Australian subsidiary of Sunshine Heart, Inc. In September of 2004, Chess Depositary Instruments or CDIs representing beneficial ownership of our common stock began trading on the Australian Securities Exchange or ASX under the symbol SHC. Initially, each CDI represented one share of our common stock. In connection with the 1-for-200 reverse stock split we affected on January 27, 2012, we changed this ratio so that each CDI represented 1/200th of a share of our common stock. Our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on February 16, 2012.  We delisted from the ASX at the close of trading on May 6, 2013.

Until December 31, 2017, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 or the JOBS Act. Furthermore, we are and will remain a smaller reporting company as long as our public float remains less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently-completed second fiscal quarter. An emerging growth company or smaller reporting company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to U.S. public companies. These provisions include an exemption from the attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting by our independent auditors pursuant to section 404 (b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) but do not preclude us from the requirement to make our own internal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, as an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.  Until such date as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with new or revised accounting standards for U.S. public companies.
 
We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period, which will end on December 31, 2017. Until such date, and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with new or revised accounting standards for U.S. public companies.
 
On September 21, 2016, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) indicating that the Staff had determined to delist our securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market due to our then continued non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.  We requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel), which occurred on November 10, 2016.  On November 11, 2016, we received notice from the Staff that we no longer satisfied Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) insofar as we did not expect to report stockholders equity of at least $2.5 million upon the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and that the deficiency could serve as an additional basis for the delisting of the Companys common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market.  On November 21, 2016, Nasdaq informed us that the Panel had granted us continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market while we implement our plan to regain compliance with the minimum bid price and minimum stockholders equity requirements.  The Panel granted us until January 30, 2017 to evidence a closing bid price of $1.00 or more for a minimum of ten prior consecutive trading days. At a special meeting of our stockholders on January 9, 2017, our stockholders approved, among other things, a reverse stock split, and following such special meeting, our Board of Directors approved a 1-for-30 reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock.  The reverse stock split was effective as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 12, 2017, and our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 13, 2017.  The reverse stock split did not change the par value of our stock or the authorized number of common or preferred shares.  All share and per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, including the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 hereof, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented.
 
After implementing the reverse stock split, we received confirmation from Nasdaq on February 9, 2017 that we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule.  The Panel granted us until March 20, 2017 to evidence compliance with the $2.5 million stockholders equity requirement. If it appears to the Nasdaq staff that we will not be able to meet the minimum stockholders equity or any other listing standard, our common stock may be subject to delisting.
