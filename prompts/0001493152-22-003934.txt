ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 21, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business are not limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search on a target business that will benefit from economic globalization, particularly as it affects emerging markets.
Initial Public Offering
 
On December 15, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units, which included the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 Units to cover over-allotments. Each unit consists of one share of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and one redeemable warrant, with each such warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses).
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private sale of 4,188,889 warrants (the “private warrants”) at a price of $0.75 per warrant to Globis SPAC LLC and Up and Up Capital, LLC, generating gross proceeds of $3,141,667. In addition, Up and Up Capital, LLC purchased an aggregate of 100,833 units (the “placement units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit, or $1,008,333 in the aggregate (collectively with the private sale of warrants, the “Private Placements”). The placement units consist of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (the “placement warrants”).
 
The net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering, together with certain of the proceeds from the Private Placements, $116,150,000 in the aggregate, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders with Wilmington Trust Company acting as trustee.
 
Note Draw Down - Business Combination Extension
 
On January 11, 2021, we issued an unsecured promissory note (as amended through January 27, 2022, the “Note”) to Globis SPAC LLC, or its assigns or successors in interest, that permits us to borrow from time to time up to $7,000,000. On December 10, 2021, we drew down $1,150,000 under the Note the proceeds from the draw down have been deposited into the Company’s trust account in order to extend the period of time the Company has to complete its initial business combination (the “Completion Window”). As a result, the Completion Window was extended by three months from December 15, 2021 until March 15, 2022. The Company’s stockholders are not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extension of the Completion Window. The Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a business combination by the Company. As of December 31, 2021, the total amount outstanding under the Note was $2,600,000.
Initial Business Combination 
 
On December 19, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Forafric Agro Holdings Limited, a Gibraltar private company limited by shares (“FAHL”) and Lighthouse Capital Limited, a Gibraltar private company limited by shares (the “Seller”).
 
The Business Combination Agreement provides for the consummation of the following transactions (collectively, the “Business Combination”): (a) we will form under the laws of the State of Nevada a wholly-owned subsidiary (the “New Subsidiary”), change its jurisdiction of incorporation to Nevada by merging with and into the New Subsidiary such that the New Subsidiary will survive the merger (the “Surviving Company”) (the “Pre-Closing Merger”), and change its jurisdiction of incorporation again by transferring by way of a redomiciliation and domesticating the New Subsidiary as a Gibraltar public company limited by shares (the “Redomiciliation”); and (b) immediately following the effectiveness of the Redomiciliation, the Surviving Company will acquire 100% of the equity interests in FAHL from the Seller. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination, FAHL will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Surviving Company, which will be renamed “Forafric Global PLC”.
 
Immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), we will effect the Pre-Closing Merger and the Redomiciliation pursuant to which (i) our issued and outstanding shares of common stock will, following the Pre-Closing Merger and pursuant to the Redomiciliation, convert automatically by operation of law, on a one-for-one basis, into ordinary shares, nominal value $0.001 per share, of Forafric Global PLC (“Ordinary Shares”); (ii) our issued and outstanding redeemable warrants will automatically become redeemable warrants to acquire Ordinary Shares and (iii) each of our issued and outstanding Units that has not been previously separated into the underlying common stock and underlying warrant upon the request of the holder thereof, will be cancelled and will entitle the holder thereof to one Ordinary Share and one redeemable warrant to acquire one Ordinary Share. No other changes will be made to the terms of any issued and outstanding warrants as a result of the Pre-Closing Merger and Redomiciliation.

The total consideration to be paid to the Seller in the Business Combination will be (i) 15,100,000 Ordinary Shares, subject to reduction to the extent that the Closing Payment (as defined below) is less than $0, provided that the Seller may be issued up to 1,904,762 additional Ordinary Shares determined based on the amount of Remaining Cash (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) at the Closing; plus (ii) an amount (the “Closing Payment”) equal to $20,000,000 minus the outstanding amount of all Funded Debt (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) as of the Closing (other than Permitted Debt); provided that Seller may receive up to an additional $20,000,000 determined based on the amount of Remaining Cash (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) at the Closing. The Closing Payment shall be funded by remaining funds in the trust account after giving effect to any Buyer Share Redemptions (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and the proceeds of any potential private placement financing.
 
In addition to the foregoing consideration, the Seller shall be entitled to receive, as additional consideration, and without any action on behalf of the Company or the Company’s stockholders, additional Ordinary Shares (the “Earnout Shares”), to be issued as follows during the period from and after the Closing until the end of calendar year 2024 (A) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2022, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) of Forafric Global PLC is equal to or greater than $27,000,000, (B) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA o Forafric Global PLC is equal to or greater than $33,000,000, and (C) 1,000,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2024, the Buyer Trading Price (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) during the standard market trading hours of a trading day is greater than or equal to $16.50 for any 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days. The Seller will also be entitled to receive, as additional consideration, and without any action on behalf of Forafric Global PLC or its stockholders, 20% of any cash proceeds received by Forafric Global PLC from the exercise of the outstanding warrants.
 
Representations and Warranties; Covenants; Indemnities
 
Under the Business Combination Agreement, the parties to the agreement made customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type. The representations and warranties made under the Business Combination Agreement generally will survive the Closing for a period of 12 months while certain representations and warranties made under the Business Combination Agreement will survive for a period of 48 months. In addition, the parties to the Business Combination Agreement agreed to be bound by certain covenants as specified in the Business Combination Agreement. The covenants made under the Business Combination generally will survive the Closing for a period of 12 months, subject to certain exceptions, including certain covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing and will survive until the end of the period of applicable performance or otherwise fully performed (or waived). Under the Business Combination Agreement, from and after the Closing, the Seller will hold harmless and indemnify Forafric Global PLC from and against any damages directly or indirectly suffered by Forafric Global PLC relating to (i) breaches of representations and warranties of FAHL and the Seller, (ii) breaches of covenants, obligations and agreements of FAHL and the Seller, and (iii) any unpaid indebtedness (other than Permitted Debt, as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) or transaction expenses of FAHL and the Seller. Other than certain limited exceptions, such indemnification obligations are subject to a general cap of $20,000,000, a threshold value of such aggregate claims of $500,000, and a minimum claim threshold of $50,000. At the Closing, 755,000 Ordinary Shares otherwise issuable to the Seller will be placed in escrow in order to secure the Seller’s indemnification obligations under the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, the Seller may also elect to satisfy such indemnification obligations by offsetting against any Earnout Shares, forfeiting additional Ordinary Shares issued to the Seller at the Closing, or paying such indemnification obligations in cash.
Conditions to Each Party’s Obligations
 
The consummation of the Business Combination is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including: (a) the approval and adoption by the Company’s stockholders of the Business Combination Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby; (b) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under any applicable antitrust laws; (c) no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) shall have occurred that is continuing; (d) the Company having at least $5,000,001 in net tangible assets as of the Closing, after giving effect to the completion of the Buyer Share Redemption (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and any private placement financing; (e) the Redomiciliation shall have been completed; (f) the memorandum of association and articles of association of the Company shall have been adopted and filed under the Companies Act 2014 of the Laws of Gibraltar and shall be in effect at the Closing; and (g) the Company’s Registration Statement (as described below) shall have been declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued by the SEC that remains in effect, and no legal proceeding seeking such a stop order shall have been initiated by the SEC that remains pending.
Termination
 
The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing under certain circumstances, including, among others, (i) by mutual written consent of us and the Seller, or (ii) by either us or the Seller if the Closing has not occurred on or before March 15, 2022 (or until June 15, 2022, if our board of directors has extended the period of time to consummate a business combination in accordance with its organizational documents, or such later date as we and the Seller may mutually agree), provided that such right to terminate is not available to us or the Seller if such party’s breach of the Business Combination Agreement has directly caused the failure of, or has prevented, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement to occur by such date.

For additional information regarding the Business Combination, see the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on January 12, 2022 (the “Registration Statement”) which contains a preliminary prospectus and proxy statement concerning the Business Combination.
 
In the event that the Company does not consummate the initial Business Combination with FAHL as described above, it will continue to search for an appropriate target up until the Completion Window.
 
PIPE Investment
 
In connection with the Business Combination, on December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a subscription agreement (the “PIPE Subscription Agreement”) with an accredited investor (the “PIPE Investor”) pursuant to which the PIPE Investor will purchase ordinary shares of Forafric Global PLC in a private placement following the Redomiciliation and prior to the closing of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreement, the PIPE Investor will purchase, at a purchase price of $10.50 per share, that number of ordinary shares of Forafric Global PLC (the “PIPE Shares”) equal to the lesser of (i) 4.99% of all issued and outstanding ordinary shares, after taking into account the completion of the Business Combination and all ordinary shares issued pursuant to the FAHL Bonds (defined below) and other related subscription agreements, if any, and (ii) 1,904,761 ordinary shares (the “PIPE Investment”). The maximum aggregate amount to be paid by the PIPE Investor for the PIPE Shares is approximately $20 million. The purpose of the sale of the PIPE Shares is to raise additional capital for use in connection with the Business Combination.
 
The closing of the sale of the PIPE Shares (the “PIPE Closing”) will be contingent upon, and substantially concurrent with, the closing of the Business Combination.
 
The PIPE Subscription Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) such date and time as the Business Combination Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms without the Business Combination having been consummated, (ii) upon the mutual written agreement of each of the parties to the PIPE Subscription Agreement and FAHL, (iii) Globis’ notification to the PIPE Investor in writing that it has, with the prior written consent of FAHL, abandoned its plans to move forward with the Business Combination, (iv) the End Date (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), if the PIPE Closing has not occurred by such date, (v) at the election of the PIPE Investor, on or after the date that is 180 days after the date of the PIPE Subscription Agreement if the PIPE Closing has not occurred on or prior to such date, or (vi) if any of the conditions to the PIPE Closing are not satisfied or waived, or are not capable of being satisfied, on or prior to the PIPE Closing, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated by the PIPE Subscription Agreement will not be and are not consummated at the PIPE Closing.
 
Pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreement, we also granted the PIPE Investor certain registration rights and have agreed to file a registration statement registering the resale of the PIPE Shares (the “PIPE Resale Registration Statement”) within 30 calendar days after the consummation of the Business Combination and to use our commercially reasonable efforts to have the PIPE Resale Registration Statement declared effective no later than the 60th calendar day following the PIPE Closing (or, in the case of an SEC review of the PIPE Resale Registration Statement, the 120th calendar day following the PIPE Closing.
 
Convertible Bonds Offering
 
In connection with the Business Combination, between December 31, 2021 and January 3, 2022, affiliates (each a “Bond Investor”) of the Sponsors, subscribed for convertible bonds of FAHL in the aggregate principal amount of $9.5 million (the “FAHL Bonds”) and on January 19, 2022 an additional bond investment was made in the principal amount of $2.5 million, both in private offerings, and issued pursuant to a Bond Subscription Deed (the “Bond Subscription Deed”), among FAHL, the Seller and the Bond Investors. The FAHL Bonds are unsecured obligations of FAHL and are not transferable without the consent of FAHL. FAHL currently intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the FAHL Bonds for general working capital and/or capital expenditure requirements.
 
Unless earlier converted or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the FAHL Bonds, the FAHL Bonds will mature and be redeemed on June 15, 2026. Interest accrues on the FAHL Bonds at a rate of 6% per annum and the Bond Investors are entitled to certain customary information rights.
 
Pursuant to the current terms of the FAHL Bonds, upon consummation of the Business Combination, the FAHL Bonds will automatically convert into ordinary shares of Forafric Global PLC at a price per share that is a 10% discount to the PIPE Investment, subject to certain adjustments. The number of ordinary shares will be equal to the quotient that results from dividing the aggregate principal amount of the respective FAHL Bond by $9.45, subject to certain adjustments.

Acquisition Strategy
 
Our acquisition strategy is to identify an untapped opportunity within our target industry and offer a public-ready business a facility through which to enter the public markets, accessing capital markets and advancing its priorities. We believe that our management team and directors’ experiences in evaluating assets through investing and company building will enable us to source the highest quality targets. Through our selection process we leverage the relationships of our management team with industry leaders, venture capitalists, private equity and hedge fund managers, respected peers, and our network of investment banking executives, attorneys, and accountants. Together with this network of trusted partners, we intend to capitalize the target business and create purposeful strategic initiatives in order to achieve attractive growth and performance targets.
Investment Criteria
 
We focus on companies that are well positioned to benefit from economic globalization, particularly as it affects emerging markets. Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following criteria for evaluating potential target businesses. Although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the criteria described below, it is our intention to acquire companies that we believe:

● | Are sector leaders in their product category or have the potential to be dominant competitors in their sectors; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Have experienced management teams and corporate governance, reporting, and control systems ready to comply with the requirements of a public listing; 
● | Have technological or brand competitive advantage; 
● | Have underexploited growth opportunities which our team is positioned to help them achieve; and 
● | Will offer attractive return on investment for our shareholders. 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until the closing of our initial business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement of private warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the private placement of private warrants are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Our initial business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
 
Subject to the limitations that a target business has a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. Accordingly, there is no basis for our public stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete a business combination. To the extent we effect a business combination with a company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of early stage or potential emerging growth companies. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Sources of Target Businesses 
 
We believe based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous business combination candidates. We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. We may engage professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions or mergers in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our insiders or any of the members of our management team be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or insiders. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (1) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time) and (2) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 
Subject to our management team’s fiduciary duties and the limitation that one or more target businesses have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Additionally, there is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses.
 
Accordingly, there is no basis for our public stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete a business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. The valuation of a financially unstable company or early stage company can be more complicated than the calculation of a mature, stable company, and any valuation we make on such a company would be based, in part, on its prospects and how successful we believe the business will be once the company matures or is stabilized. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 

● | financial condition and results of operation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------
● | growth potential; 
● | brand recognition and potential; 
● | return on equity or invested capital; 
● | market capitalization or enterprise value; 


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | capital requirements; 
● | competitive position; 
● | barriers to entry; 
● | stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
● | existing distribution and potential for expansion; 
● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas; 
● | impact of regulation on the business; 
● | regulatory environment of the industry; 
● | costs associated with effecting the business combination; 
● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and 
● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. 


5
-

 

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Our management may not consider any of the above criteria in evaluating a prospective target business. The retention of our officers and directors following the completion of any business combination will not be a material consideration in our evaluation of a prospective target business.
 
Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.
 
Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business 
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the funds in the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account), which we refer to as the 80% test, at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may structure a business combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. If we are no longer listed on Nasdaq, we will not be required to satisfy the 80% test.
 
We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). We are not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the target business we select has a fair market value in excess of at least 80% of the balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make such determination on its own. The board of directors, in light of its fiduciary obligation to stockholders, would be required to determine whether it is capable of valuing the target company based on the experience of its members in valuing companies and whether the board was actually able to reach a determination of value with respect to the particular target company.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management Team 
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management team, including the management team of FAHL, of a prospective target business for, among other things, their ability to manage a company with securities that are publicly traded, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination, our assessment of the target business’ management team may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management team may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following our initial business combination remains to be determined. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination 
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders and sponsors have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until March 15, 2022 (or until June 15, 2022 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
 
Our initial stockholders, sponsors and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. In addition, Chardan Capital Markets, LLC has agreed (1) to vote its equity participation shares in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any of its equity participation shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any of its equity participation shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought stockholder approval of a proposed transaction, we would need only a limited number of public shares to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved.

If we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Conversion/Tender Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders and sponsors have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. In addition, Chardan Capital Markets, LLC has agreed (1) to vote its equity participation shares in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any of its equity participation shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any of its equity participation shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of its shares.
 
Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public stockholder will be provided the opportunity to sell its public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.
 
Our initial stockholders, officers and directors do not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly.
 
We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, public stockholders may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, it may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

Ability to Extend Time to Complete a Business Combination
 
We currently have until March 15, 2022 to complete a business combination; provided, however, that if we anticipate we may not be able to consummate a business combination by March 15, 2022, the Company, by resolution of the board of directors if requested by Globis SPAC LLC, may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months up until June 15, 2022), subject to the deposit of additional funds into the trust account by one or both of the sponsors or their affiliates or designees. Our public stockholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in order for the time available for us to consummate a business combination to be extended, one or both of the sponsors or their affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $1,000,000, or $1,150,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.10 per unit in either case, up to an aggregate of $2,300,000), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three-month extension. Any such payments will be made in the form of a non-interest bearing loan and will be repaid, if at all, from funds released to the Company upon completion of a business combination. On December 10, 2021, we drew down $1,150,000 under an unsecured promissory note that was previously issued to Globis SPAC LLC, the Company’s initial public offering sponsor. The proceeds from the draw down have been deposited into our trust account in order to extend the period of time the Company has to complete its initial business combination from December 15, 2021 until March 15, 2022. The Company’s stockholders are not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extension. The note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a business combination by the Company.
Automatic Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination by March 15, 2022 (or June 15, 2022 if we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination for by an additional three months, subject to the deposit of additional funds into the trust account as described above), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. At such time, the warrants will expire and holders of warrants will receive nothing upon a liquidation with respect to such warrants, and the warrants will be worthless.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any redemptions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a redemption is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 18th month from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the above procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
We agreed to have any prospective target businesses and use our best efforts to have all third parties enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account.

As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that third parties, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsors have agreed that they will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by third parties for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, or any reductions in the value of the trust assets, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below $10.20 per public share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, our sponsors may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations, as we have not required our sponsors to retain any assets to provide for their indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that our sponsors will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, our sponsors will not be liable to our public stockholders and instead will only have liability to us. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than approximately $10.20 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us, subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below.
 
If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate the redemption of our public shares. Our insiders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their founder shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account and from the interest income on the balance of the trust account (net income and other tax obligations) that may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements. If such funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. Each holder of public shares will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.20.
 
If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.

Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we hold a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholder’s rights or pre-business combination activity (including the substance or timing within which we have to complete a business combination), we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, in connection with any such vote. Our insiders have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founder shares, placement shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their shares of common stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, in each case subject to the limitations described herein; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
● | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 12 months of the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the extend the period of time to consummate a business combination), then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account to all of our public holders of shares of common stock; 


● | upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, $116,150,000 was placed into the trust account; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and 
● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. 

Potential Revisions to Agreements with Insiders
 
Each of our insiders has entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which each of them has agreed to do certain things relating to us and our activities prior to a business combination. We could seek to amend these letter agreements without the approval of stockholders, although we have no intention to do so. In particular:

● | Restrictions relating to liquidating the trust account if we failed to consummate a business combination in the time-frames specified above could be amended, but only if we allowed all stockholders to redeem their shares in connection with such amendment; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Restrictions relating to our insiders being required to vote in favor of a business combination or against any amendments to our organizational documents could be amended to allow our insiders to vote on a transaction as they wished; 
● | The requirement of members of the management team to remain our officer or director until the closing of a business combination could be amended to allow persons to resign from their positions with us if, for example, the current management team was having difficulty locating a target business and another management team had a potential target business; 
● | The restrictions on transfer of our securities could be amended to allow transfer to third parties who were not members of our original management team; 
● | The obligation of our management team to not propose amendments to our organizational documents could be amended to allow them to propose such changes to our stockholders; 
● | The obligation of insiders to not receive any compensation in connection with a business combination could be modified in order to allow them to receive such compensation; and 
● | The requirement to obtain a valuation for any target business affiliated with our insiders, in the event it was too expensive to do so. 

 
Except as specified above, stockholders would not be required to be given the opportunity to redeem their shares in connection with such changes. Such changes could result in:
 

● | Our insiders being able to vote against a business combination or in favor of changes to our organizational documents; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our operations being controlled by a new management team that our stockholders did not elect to invest with; 
● | Our insiders receiving compensation in connection with a business combination; and 
● | Our insiders closing a transaction with one of their affiliates without receiving an independent valuation of such business. 

 
We will not agree to any such changes unless we believed that such changes were in the best interests of our stockholders (for example, if we believed such a modification were necessary to complete a business combination). Each of our officers and directors have fiduciary obligations to us requiring that they act in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders.

Competition
 
If we succeed in effecting the Business Combination with FAHL, there will likely be significant competition from FAHL’s competitors. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to the Business Combination, Forafric Global PLC (“New Forafric”) will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. In the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, in identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, venture capital firms, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources, which could be reduced further because of our obligation to convert shares held by our public stockholders as well as any tender offer we conduct. Our management team is not experienced in pursuing business combinations on behalf of blank check companies. Other blank check companies may be sponsored and managed by individuals with prior experience in completing business combinations between blank check companies and target businesses. Our managements’ lack of experience may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. These inherent limitations give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
 
We have one executive officer, Paul Packer, who serves as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Mr. Packer is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intends to devote only as much time as he deems necessary to our affairs. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States GAAP or IFRS as issued by the IASB. A particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate may not have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination with the proposed target business.
 
We may be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have our internal control over financial reporting audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of their internal control over financial reporting. The development of the internal control over financial reporting of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such initial business combination.
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1.0 billion or our total revenues exceed $1.07 billion or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
