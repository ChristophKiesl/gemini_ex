ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Fact, Inc. (“We” or the “Company” as the context may require) was established under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 17, 2017 as Tiburon International Trading Corporation (“Tiburon”). Tiburon was established as a development stage company focusing its business on the distribution of air infiltration valves manufactured in China to markets in Europe and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). On October 5, 2020, Kryptos Art Technologies, Inc. (“Kryptos”), an Ontario corporation purchased 50,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock from Yun Cai, who was the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Sole Director of Tiburon.

The Company is winding down operations of the historic Tiburon business, which has largely been curtailed by prior management because of COVID-19 and lack of capital necessary for expansion of the website and product offerings. Kryptos had been working on a technology designed to detect and eliminate fraud in the art world. Kryptos has assigned all of its technological know-how in this area to the Company which we will pursue as our primary business operations.
 
In connection this new line of business, we have entered into and are negotiating a series of development and consulting agreements with software and hardware developers to complete the development of our products. The Company expects to enter into a license agreement to utilize fraud detection technology in the art area. The Company expects to enter into such license agreement with an award winning forensic ballistic technology company that revolutionized the Criminal Justice system’s approach to ballistics.
 
FACT stands for Forensic Asset Certification Technology. FACT is creating technology to utilize white light interferometry to bring forensic technology to the art world. FACT takes a non-destructive 3D digital fingerprint of the art using over 100,000 unique images. These scans, measured at two (2) microns, equal to 1/50th of a human hair, are unable to be reproduced or forged. Scans are compared to one another by a computer algorithm to verify the paintings or other assets authenticity.
 
All data is stored securely on the block-chain for real time collection management. We are currently developing a front-end user interface as well as modifying existing ballistics firmware for a comprehensive verification, tracking and reporting system. A workable prototype (the “Prototype”) is expected to be ready during the Company’s second quarter ending July 31, 2022.
 
We plan to market to various channels in different capacities including, but not limited to, subscription models, leasing models, and individual point of sale models. The fees for our different models will range from a flat fee to a percentage of sales fee. We are hopeful the Company will commence its marketing efforts in the Company’s second quarter ending April 30, 2022, with the hope that the product may launch by the end of the Company’s second quarter ending July 31, 2022.
 
Our products are not yet commercially available and we do not expect them to be commercially available until at least the end of the second quarter of 2022 if ever. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:
 

■ | continue research and development of our existing product prototypes; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | seek to discover and develop additional products with our technology; 
■ | establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any of our products; 
■ | seek to comply with regulatory standards and laws; 
■ | maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio; 
■ | hire manufacturing, engineering and other personnel to support our products development and future commercialization efforts; 
■ | add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; and 
■ | incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.

JOBS Act
 
As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (or the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
 
An emerging growth company may also take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:
 

■ | we may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
■ | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
■ | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

 
We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which such fifth anniversary will occur in 2021. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period.
 
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this prospectus and, as long as we continue to qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect to take advantage of this and other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” as defined under SEC Regulation S-K. As such, we also are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and also are subject to less extensive disclosure requirements regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We will continue to be deemed a smaller reporting company until our public float exceeds $75 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year.
