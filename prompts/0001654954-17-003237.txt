 Item 1. Business
  
  Introduction and General Background
  
 We are a staffing company, operating primarily in the manual on-demand labor segment of the staffing industry. In 2016, we employed approximately 34,000 workers providing services to approximately 3,200 customers, primarily in the areas of light industrial, hospitality and event services. Our customers range in size from small businesses to large corporate enterprises. All of our workers, which we refer to as “field team members” are employed by us. Most of our work assignments are short term and many are filled on little notice from our customers. In addition to short and longer term temporary work assignments, we sometimes recruit and place workers in temp-to-hire situations.
  
 As of December 30, 2016, we owned and operated 64 on-demand labor locations, or stores, across 21 states. We currently operate as Command Center, Inc. Prior to 2014, we also operated through our former wholly-owned subsidiary, Disaster Recovery Services, Inc., (“DR Services”). We ceased the corporate existence of DR Services as of April 2016. We have also created a separate, dormant entity, ComStaff, Inc. All financial information is consolidated and reported in our consolidated financial statements. In 2015 we moved our corporate headquarters from Coeur d’Alene, Idaho to Lakewood, Colorado.
  
 In prior years we were organized as Command Staffing, LLC. We were organized on December 26, 2002 and commenced operations in 2003 as a franchisor of on-demand labor businesses. In November 2005, the assets of Command Staffing, LLC and Harborview Software, Inc., an affiliated company that owned the software used in the operation of our on-demand labor stores, were acquired by Temporary Financial Services, Inc., a public company. The transaction was accounted for as if Command Staffing, LLC was the accounting acquirer. In November 2005, we changed our name to Command Center, Inc.
  
  Industry Overview
  
 The on-demand labor industry developed based on the business need for flexible staffing options. Many businesses operate in a cyclical production environment and find it difficult to staff according to their changing production cycles. Companies also desire a way to temporarily replace full-time employees when absent due to illness, vacation, or unplanned termination. On-demand labor offers employers the opportunity to immediately respond to changes in staffing needs, reduce the costs associated with recruiting and interviewing, eliminate unemployment and workers’ compensation exposure, and draw from a larger employment pool.
  
 The on-demand labor industry continues to develop specialized market segments that reflect the diverse needs of the businesses it serves. Technical skills, prior work history, duration of assignment, and background check requirements vary among industries and employers. We operate primarily within the short-term, semi-skilled and unskilled segments of the on-demand labor industry. We endeavor to customize our services according to the unique opportunities and assets presented by each of our locations while leveraging our overall size. This approach reduces our overhead costs, improves economies of scale, establishes procedural uniformity and internal controls, and creates a predictable internal environment for our field team members.

  Business
  
  Strategic Growth Opportunities:  We continue to build our network of on-demand labor stores. We supply a quality workforce and we always strive to consistently place the right candidates in the right jobs. We have more than 60 locally-managed stores throughout the United States that serve as trusted partners to businesses and job seekers alike. Clients, representing a variety of industries, trust us to learn their business and to plan ahead to address their dynamic staffing needs. Job seekers trust us to understand their complete employment picture and place them in on-demand, temporary, temp-to-hire, or permanent placement positions where they can grow, thrive, and provide immediate value. The total number of stores open and operating increased from 57 at the end of fiscal year 2015 to 64 at the end of fiscal year 2016 as we expanded our operations while continuing to improve our business fundamentals. In 2017, we plan to continue our strategy of carefully balancing store expansion against return on investment. In doing so, we expect to concentrate our revenue growth efforts primarily in sales growth within our existing store structure, while opening new stores in areas we believe present exceptional opportunities. In all of our growth opportunities, we continue to emphasize the fundamentals of our business: sell to quality accounts, increase margins where possible and provide exceptional customer service.
  
  On-demand Labor Store Operations: In 2016, we continued to focus on the basics of our business: consistency and excellence in service, increases in margins, containment of costs, selling techniques, and company culture. We concentrated on these measures to improve profitability and solidify the groundwork for future growth.
  
 During the year, we employed approximately 34,000 field team members and serviced approximately 3,200 customers. Our stores are located across 21 states. Our stores are often located in proximity to concentrated commercial and industrial areas typically with access to public transportation and other services that are important to our field team members. We have developed a store demographic model to identify and qualify future possible store locations.
  
 We manage our field operations using in-store personnel, area managers and corporate management personnel. Where appropriate, we also include business development specialists to help drive business to our stores. The intention and structure of our compensation plans for store managers, area managers, and business development specialists have been designed to aid in securing and retaining the qualified personnel needed to meet our business, financial, and growth objectives. Our personnel practices are designed to support our need to attract, screen, hire, train, support and retain qualified personnel at all levels of our organization. We take best practices from our higher performing stores and propagate these practices across all operating groups to produce consistent execution and improvements in company-wide performance.
  
  Our Temporary Staff (Field Team Members):   Field team members are our product and our key asset. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract, train, motivate, and reward our field team members. We have invested in many proprietary programs designed to create a long term relationship with top-performing field team members. These programs include health insurance, bonus programs, safety rewards, longevity programs, training programs, and career services.
  
 The pool of qualified, available field team members varies by location. For most of our stores, the supply of workers is sufficient and diverse enough to meet current client needs. However, in some locations, worker availability is a limiting factor. We continue to seek additional field team members through internet postings, newspaper advertisements, printed flyers, store displays, career fairs, and word-of-mouth.
  
  Our Customers:   In 2016, we serviced approximately 3,200 customers in a variety of industries. Our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of our revenue in 2016. The top six industries we served retail, construction, warehousing, industrial/manufacturing, transportation, and hospitality. In 2015, we serviced approximately 3,300 customers in a variety of industries. Our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 25% of our revenue in 2015. The top six industries we served were retail, construction, warehousing, industrial/manufacturing, transportation, and hospitality.
  
  Our Marketing Strategy:   We recognize that our customers are too busy to have time consumed by a traditional sales person, but rather are looking for a consultant that provides smart solutions to their current challenges. Our unique sales process starts by learning about potential customers and facilitating conversations with them where we offer support and contribute to a growing relationship. Together, we create an action plan that draws on our core competencies and solves our potential client's needs. Once we have resolved one need, we consistently strive to meet future needs, with the goal of converting a business prospect to a repeat customer. We serve many of our existing customers from multiple stores, across multiple cities, and in many cases, across multiple states. We have tailored programs to specifically address the needs of these national accounts and plan to continue our efforts to expand our national accounts in the years ahead.

  Our Workers’ Compensation Coverage: In accordance with the laws of every state, we provide our temporary workers and our full time staff with workers’ compensation insurance. Currently, we are covered under a large deductible policy with ACE American Insurance Company ("ACE") where we have primary responsibility for claims under the policy. Under our current policy which has been in place since April 1, 2014, we are responsible for covered losses and expenses up to $500,000 per incident. Amounts in excess of $500,000 are the responsibility of our workers’ compensation insurance provider. From April 1, 2012 through March 31, 2014 we were covered under a large deductible policy issued by Dallas National Insurance. Under the prior policy, we are responsible for covered losses and expenses up to $350,000 per incident. Amounts in excess of $350,000 are the responsibility of our workers’ compensation insurance provider. Our policy from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012 was a guaranteed cost policy where we were fully insured on all claims occurring in covered states. Our policies before April 1, 2011 were large deductible policies similar to our current coverage. Under these prior policies, we still have a primary responsibility for all claims occurring before April 1, 2011 until all claims are resolved completely, up to our deductible of $250,000 on a per person basis. Amounts in excess of $250,000 are the responsibility of our previous workers’ compensation insurance providers.
  
 For workers’ compensation claims originating in Washington and North Dakota, we pay workers’ compensation insurance premiums and obtain full coverage under mandatory state administered programs. Our liability associated with claims in these states is limited to our premium payments.
  
  Our Safety Program:  To protect our workforce and help control workers’ compensation insurance rates, we maintain several company-wide safety programs designed to increase awareness of safety issues. We provide safety training through videos, employee safety manuals, and safety testing. Managers often conduct job site safety inspections on new jobs to ensure that our field team members are working in a safe environment. We encourage safe work behavior through an incentive program that rewards our field team members for working accident free. We also encourage our field team members to report unsafe working conditions. We evaluate the risk profile of the work we undertake on an ongoing basis and sometimes restrict classes of work in order to minimize risk.
  
  Our Seasonality:  Some of the industries in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Many of the jobs filled by field team members are outdoor jobs that are generally performed during the warmer months of the year. As a result, activity increases in the spring and continues at higher levels through summer, then begins to taper off during fall and through winter. Seasonal fluctuations are typically less in the western and southwestern parts of the United States where many of our stores are located. These fluctuations in seasonal business affect financial performance from period to period. Severe weather in any of our locations for prolonged periods has the potential to impair our business within these geographies given the outdoor nature of much of our assignments.
  
  Our Competition:  The manual labor sector of the on-demand labor industry in which we operate is largely fragmented and highly competitive, with low barriers to entry. Our competitors range in size from small, local or regional operators with five or fewer locations to large, multi-national operations with hundreds of locations.
  
 The primary competitive factors in our market segment include price, the ability to timely provide the requested workers, and overall quality of service. Secondary factors include worker quality and performance, efficiency, the ability to meet the business-to-business vendor requirements, name recognition, established reputation, and customer relationships. While barriers to entry are low, businesses operating in this sector of the on-demand labor industry do require access to significant working capital, particularly in the spring and summer when seasonal staffing requirements are higher. Lack of working capital can be a significant impediment to growth for small, local, and regional on-demand labor providers. In addition, the growth in government regulation is also creating a barrier to entry as many smaller firms cannot profitably comply with the administrative burden of the new regulations.
  
  Our Trademarks and Trade Names:  We have registered “Command,” “Command Center,” “Command Staffing,” “Command Labor,” “Real Jobs for Real People,” “Bakken Staffing.” “Disaster Recovery Services,” “Apply Today, Daily Pay,” “A Different Kind of Labor Place,” and “Labor Commander,” as service marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
  
  Our Intellectual Property:  We have proprietary software systems in place to handle most aspects of our operations, including temporary staff dispatch activities, invoicing, accounts receivable, and payroll. Our software systems also provide internal control over our operations, as well as produce internal management reports necessary to track the financial performance of individual stores. We utilize a dashboard-type system to provide management with critical information and we refine our systems and processes based on the feedback we receive. Our proprietary software systems are not patented and are not licensed to or used by any other organization. We have invested in off-site back-up and storage systems that we believe provide reasonable protections for our electronic information systems against breakdowns as well as other disruptions and other unauthorized intrusions. Any failure in our systems could have an adverse effect on our operations.
  
  Our Real Property: We lease the real property for of all of our store locations and our corporate office. All of these properties are leased at market rates that vary, depending on location. Each store is between 1,000 and 5,000 square feet, depending on locations and market conditions. We believe that our corporate office and each of the store locations are adequate for our current needs.

  Our Employees:  We currently employ a staff of approximately 28 at our corporate headquarters in Lakewood, Colorado. The number of employees at the corporate headquarters is not expected to increase significantly over the next year. We also employ approximately 191 field operations staff located at the various on-demand labor stores. During fiscal year 2016, we employed approximately 34,000 temporary workers. We are the employer of record for our temporary workers and, as such, are responsible for collecting withholding taxes and for paying employer contributions for social security, unemployment tax, workers’ compensation, other insurance programs and all other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In addition to completing the Form I-9 required by the Department of Homeland Security, we also confirm the identity and work eligibility of each applicant through the federal E-Verify system.
  
  Environmental Concerns: Because we are a service business, federal, state, or local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment do not impact our business.
