General



SOAR Technology Acquisition Corp., a blank check company, is led by Joe Poulin through his family office, JPK Capital, and supported by Peter Kern and the Inovia Growth Fund II, represented by Chris Arsenault and Patrick Pichette. Our company was created to leverage the founders’ extensive experience in acquiring, building, and operating businesses across various technology industries. While we may pursue an acquisition or a business combination target in any tech-enabled industry, we intend to partner with a scalable growth company that benefits from secular tailwinds, has a competitive market position, attractive unit economics, and a proven management team.




Our team has decades of operational, investment, and acquisition experience in the technology and media sectors. Mr. Poulin brings an entrepreneurial and investing skillset built over 20 years, having created and grown Luxury Retreats into one of the world’s largest specialty villa rental companies prior to its sale to Airbnb in 2017, one of Airbnb’s largest acquisitions to date. Chris Arsenault co-founded Inovia Capital in 2007 investing in applied services and infrastructure businesses seeking to transform complex industries, such as financial services and commerce. Patrick Pichette, a Partner at Inovia Capital, offers public company capabilities, having served as the Chief Financial Officer of Google from 2008 to 2015 and as Chairman of Twitter from 2020 to 2021 and a director since 2017. Mr. Kern provides operating expertise as well as diverse public company and governance experience, having served on the boards and as Chief Executive Officer of two large public companies including leading Tribune Media Company through its approximately $7.2 billion sale to Nexstar Media Group, Inc. and navigating Expedia Group Inc. during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Martha Tredgett and Greg Greeley also serve on our board, further expanding the capabilities of the team. Ms. Tredgett provides capital raising experience and a vast network of investor relationships and Mr. Greeley enhances the operating experience of our team having recently served as President of Airbnb Homes after spending 19 years at Amazon.com in various senior roles.



We believe that the entrepreneurial backgrounds, operational expertise, and extensive network of relationships of our leadership team will enable us to source and execute a value-focused transaction that will generate attractive returns for our shareholders. In addition, the team has broad experience serving as advisors, board members, and mentors to a variety of business leaders and companies across multiple sectors in the technology industry. We believe that management teams will be able to benefit from the advice of our leaders, who have a large depth of experience ranging from start-ups to global corporations.



We were incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have reviewed a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



Market opportunity



We believe there are numerous partners operating in the technology and technology-enabled industries that are well-advantaged and highly scalable with the right guidance from an acquisition partner. We are targeting a company valued between approximately $1 billion and $5 billion that has a sizable market share and capacity to achieve a market leading position. Our vast sourcing network grants us access to a wide range of investment candidates, while our structured acquisition process lends itself to rigorous diligence of underlying fundamentals and evaluation of potential expansion avenues. Our team’s public market experience allows us to mentor founders to become well equipped for the transition to public markets.



Initial business combination process



In evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to seek to determine a company’s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review may include, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, multiple meetings with management, consultations with relevant industry experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as a review of additional information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Members of our and JPK’s management teams, including our officers and directors, directly or indirectly own our securities and accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Our sponsor and certain members of our board of directors acquired founder shares for approximately $0.003 per share and we offered units at a price of $10.00 per unit in our initial public offering; as a result, our sponsor and directors could make a substantial profit after the initial business combination even if public investors experience substantial losses. Because the threshold at which a transaction will be profitable for our sponsor and directors is significantly lower than for investors, the interests of our management and directors in deciding which opportunities to pursue may not align with the interests of public investors. In addition, each of our officers and directors, as well as our and JPK’s management teams, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers, directors and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination.





2







Each of our directors and officers, as well as those of JPK and Inovia Capital, presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our, JPK’s or Inovia Capital’s officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. Inovia Capital and its affiliates manage a number of funds, separate accounts and other investment vehicles (“Inovia Funds”), which may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these Inovia Funds decide to pursue any such opportunity or have existing investments in the issuer of such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Inovia Capital, including by any director affiliated with Inovia Capital, may be suitable for both us and for a current or future Inovia Fund and, in such a case, will be directed to such Inovia Fund rather than to us. Neither JPK, Inovia Capital nor, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, any members of our management team who are also employed by JPK or Inovia Capital have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. JPK, Inovia Capital and/or members of our management team, in their capacities as officers, directors or employees of JPK or Inovia Capital or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future Inovia Funds, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us.



In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make investments and to sell existing investments because JPK or Inovia Capital may have material, non-public information regarding the issuers of the applicable securities or as a result of an existing investment by JPK or an Inovia Fund. We may acquire a target from or, in which, JPK or one or more Inovia Funds have an existing investment (or makes an investment at the same time or subsequently) at a different or overlapping level of the target’s capital structure, creating a potential conflict between our position and JPK’s or the applicable Inovia Funds’ position especially in the event of a bankruptcy. JPK, JPK employees, Inovia Capital, Inovia Capital employees and Inovia Funds may also have or make investments in, establish or serve on the boards of, businesses that compete with, provide services to, transact with, or otherwise have significant business relationships with the businesses we invest or seek to invest in. We may also forego an attractive investment opportunity as a result of an existing investment in the target or a competitor of the target by JPK, an Inovia Fund or principals or employees of JPK or Inovia Capital, or to otherwise mitigate any conflict of interest or the perception of any conflict of interest.



JPK, Inovia Capital and the Inovia Growth II Funds and our sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. As a result, JPK, Inovia Capital and our sponsor, officers and directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. In addition, JPK, Inovia Capital and our sponsor, officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time or resources to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time and resources among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. In addition, our memorandum and articles of association contain provisions to indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such persons in respect of any liability, obligation or duty to the company, that may arise as a consequence of such persons becoming aware of any business opportunity or failing to present such business opportunity.

Initial business combination



So long as our securities are then listed on the NYSE, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of the target business or businesses upon standards generally accepted by the financial community. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.



We have until 15 months from the closing of our “IPO” to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 15 months, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this annual report, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $2,300,000 ($0.10 per share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline for each of the available three month extensions, providing a total possible business combination period of 21 months at a total payment value of $4,600,000, in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note. Such loans may be converted into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Any such loans that are not converted to warrants will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. If we do not complete a business combination, we will not repay such loans. Furthermore, the letter agreements with our initial shareholders contain a provision pursuant to which our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loans out of the funds held in the trust account in the event that we do not complete a business combination. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test.

We may, at our option, subject to applicable law, pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with one or more entities affiliated with JPK, Inovia Capital and/or one or more Inovia Funds and/or one or more investors in Inovia Funds, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. We refer to this potential future issuance, or a similar issuance to other specified purchasers, as a “specified future issuance” throughout this annual report. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. This is not an offer for any specified future issuance. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B ordinary shares, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 25% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of our IPO plus all shares issued in the specified future issuance, unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agreed to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our Class B ordinary shares at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class B ordinary shares, but would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our ordinary shares.



To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. These risks include, among others, investing in a business without a proven business model and with limited historical financial data, volatile revenues or earnings, intense competition and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.



Other considerations



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, JPK, the Inovia Growth II Funds, or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of JPK, the Inovia Growth II Funds or our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.

JPK, the Inovia Growth II Funds, members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.



In addition, JPK, Inovia Capital and certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities. As a result, if any of JPK, Inovia Capital or our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. JPK, Inovia Capital and our sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. As a result, JPK, Inovia Capital and our sponsor, officers and directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates.



In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any such entity.

Corporate information



Our executive offices are located at 228 Park Avenue S PMB 74335, New York, New York 10003-1502 and our telephone number is (212) 503-2855. We maintain a corporate website at soartechnologyacq.com. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not part of this annual report.



We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands (the “Companies Act”). As an exempted company, we have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 30 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.





7







In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
