ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
MobileSmith, Inc. (referred to herein as, “MobileSmith,” the “Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in August 1993 and became a public company through a self-registration in February 2005.
 Principal Products and Services
  
 MobileSmith is a developer of software applications for the healthcare industry.  Our software products include a cloud-based  collection of  applications that run on our architected healthcare technology ecosystem.  The architecture is designed to do the following:
   ●
 improve experience of healthcare patients and consumers, who are often at the same time members of various medical insurance networks

  ●
 optimize delivery of healthcare and relationship between members and insurance networks

  ●
 increase adoption, utilization and intelligence of EMRs (electronic medical records), extend EMR's usability to patients and consumers of healthcare


Since 2013 the Company focused exclusively on the development of do-it-yourself customer facing platform that enabled organizations to rapidly create, deploy, and manage custom, native smartphone and tablet apps deliverable across iOS and Android mobile platforms without writing a single line of code.  During 2017 the Company concluded that it had its highest rate of success with clients within the Healthcare industry and concentrated its development and sales and marketing efforts in that industry.  During 2018 we further refined our Healthcare offering and redefined our product - a suite of e-health mobile solutions that consist of a catalog of ready to deploy mobile app solutions (App Blueprints) and support services.  In 2019 and 2020 we consolidated our  current solutions under a single offering branded Peri™.  Peri™ is designed to bridge the gap between healthcare industry system tools and healthcare consumer's mobile device.

 From time to time we have provided custom software development services.  Such services are not core to our business model and will likely decrease in significance in the future.

 Target Market and Sales Channels
 
During 2017 we completed a strategic shift and focused our business and research and development activities primarily on the Healthcare industry in the United States. In 2018 we refined our healthcare focus by identifying two target markets: (i) healthcare providers (including hospitals, hospital systems and the United States Veterans Health Administration) and (ii) healthcare payer market (including insurance companies and insurance brokers).
 
Both markets are targeted with a diversified sales workforce that includes direct sales and resellers, such as channel partners. 
 
Principal Customers
 
  During 2019 we increased our services to a government agency and the revenue from that relationship comprised 17% of our recognized aggregate revenue. This same customer accounted for 12% of recognized revenue in 2020.  The contract with this customer was completed in 2020. Such services are not core to our business model and unlikely to be significant in the future.


 For the year ended December 31, 2020, one customer accounted for 12% of the Company’s revenue. Two customers accounted for 91% of the net accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2020.
    Research and Development  

 During 2017 and 2018 we focused our technological and design efforts on our Blueprint features, that dominated our offering to healthcare providers in 2019  (Blueprint is a  fully customizable pre-built app targeting specific healthcare related business function or health condition).
 
During 2019 we invested heavily in development of our Peri™ solution, which was introduced to the market during that year and in 2020 we continued to refine the product and add features.

 Competition
 
We have been successful in penetrating the healthcare provider technology market and developed extensive expertise in the industry.  With many of our customers we enjoy five-plus year relationships.  However, the healthcare provider technology industry is highly competitive.  Our competitors range from successful established companies to emerging start-ups.  Many of these companies have significantly greater financial, personnel, and other resources than we do.  Moreover, more companies enter the industry and market every year.  As a result of this, we expect the competition we face to grow stronger in the next five years.
Intellectual Property
 
During 2014, we stopped pursuing the majority of our patent applications as we determined that the cost of pursuing them is greater than the potential protection provided by them.  Since then we have been granted one patent associated with our technology.
 
We also have several trademarks registered and pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These trademarks cover certain brand names of our offerings.
 
 Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 28 full time employees and no part-time employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
