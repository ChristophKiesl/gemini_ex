 Overview
 Invitae’s mission is to bring comprehensive genetic information into mainstream medical practice to improve the quality of healthcare for billions of people. Our goal is to aggregate most of the world’s hereditary genetic tests into a single service with higher quality, faster turnaround time and lower pricing than many single gene tests today. We were founded on four core principles:

• | Patients should own and control their own genetic information;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Healthcare professionals are fundamental in ordering and interpreting genetic information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Driving down the price of genetic information will increase its clinical and personal utility; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Genetic information is more valuable when shared.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the keys to our future success will be to steadily reduce the costs we incur in providing test results, which enables us to increase the amount of genetic content we offer in the form of an expanded test menu for the same or lower prices, thereby increasing demand and revenues. Therefore, we measured our success in 2016 with four key metrics:
  
• | lowering cost of goods sold per test (COGS);
--+---------------------------------------------


• | increasing our content by expanding our test menu;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | increasing our volumes; and
--+----------------------------


• | increasing our revenues and improving reimbursement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 We are focused on making comprehensive, high quality genetic testing more affordable and more accessible than ever before, pursuing a large and rapidly growing market. We aim to do so for the majority of hereditary genetic tests, consolidating most of them into a single offering at a price below the typical prices of many single gene or multi‑gene panels. We have learned that this value proposition resonates with clinicians and payers and believe that we can help payers and the healthcare system significantly reduce their current testing expenditures.
 Since our inception we have focused on the immediate market for diagnosing patients with symptomatic disease. In the future, we plan on expanding our efforts in carrier and newborn testing markets and later into the health and wellness market. As our market share grows we expect that our business will develop in three stages over the longer term:
 
 
1) | Genetic testing: making genetic testing more affordable and more accessible with faster turnaround time than ever before. We believe that there is a significant market opportunity for high volume, low cost genetic testing that can allow us to serve a large number of clients.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) | Genome network: sharing genetic information on a global scale to advance science and medicine. We plan to help patients share their genetic information in a way that benefits them and us by acting as a permission-based broker on their behalf.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Genome management: building a secure and trusted genome management infrastructure. By generating and storing large amounts of individualized genetic information for every patient sample, we believe we can create value over the course of disease or lifetime of a client
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We utilize an integrated portfolio of laboratory processes, software tools and informatics capabilities to process DNA-containing samples, analyze information about patient-specific genetic variation and generate test reports for clinicians and their patients. 
 We launched our first commercial offering in November 2013 with an offering of more than 200 genes, growing the test menu over time to include more than 1,100 genes. Our volume has grown rapidly. In 2016 we delivered approximately 57,000 billable tests and received or “accessioned” more than 59,000 commercial samples. We saw significant increases in our volume when we expanded our test menu, including meaningful growth in the non‑cancer test portion of our market. We expect that will continue to be the case in 2017 as we plan to introduce our medical exome, thus increasing our menu to more than 20,000 genes. Our revenues in 2016 were $25.0 million and, at December 31, 2016, we had 332 employees. In support of our efforts to reduce COGS, expand our test menu, and develop a scalable laboratory infrastructure, we incurred research and development expenses of $44.6 million, $42.8 million and $22.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 Our products today 
 Our current products consist of assays totaling over 1,100 genes that can be used for multiple indications including hereditary cancer, neurological disorders, cardiovascular disorders, pediatric disorders and other hereditary conditions.
 We offer comprehensive panels for hundreds of hereditary conditions in cancer, cardiology, neuromuscular, pediatric and rare diseases. We offer full gene sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis as a standard for all of our tests at no additional charge. We currently offer a free re‑requisition of additional data within the same indication when ordered within 90 days of the original date of service.
 As our genetic testing offering grows in scale, we have begun investing in informatics solutions and infrastructure that enable sharing of genetic information to improve healthcare and clinical outcomes. In January 2017, we acquired AltaVoice, formerly PatientCrossroads, a patient-centered data company with a global platform for collecting, curating, coordinating, and delivering safeguarded data from patients and clinicians. The acquisition, complemented by several other strategic partnerships, expands our genome network, designed to connect patients, clinicians, advocacy organizations, researchers, and therapeutic developers to accelerate the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of hereditary disease. Both companies share common commitments: patients own their data; permission-based sharing of patient data can be valuable to improving patient outcomes; patients should decide what's best for them; and using technology to remove barriers to diagnosis and treatment.
 AltaVoice has developed multiple patient-centered programs, including Patient Insights Networks, also known as PINs, which enable organizations to more efficiently build engaged, research-ready patient communities, recruit for trials, educate, and track patient outcomes. Since 2007, Alta Voice has developed programs for more than 400 diseases through its work with more than 100 advocacy groups, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), as well as biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Invitae's ongoing testing business combined with AltaVoice's database of more than 75,000 patients brings together valuable capabilities, technology, and data to accelerate the use of genetic information for the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary diseases.
 We are aiming to build a more robust network for combining genetic information and clinical data into a seamless network to accelerate research, clinical trials and disease management. In the future, patients who participate in the combined network will be able to access aggregate and customized information based on their genotype and phenotype and participate in new research, clinical trials, treatment planning or other related purposes 
 4

that may benefit the individual and/or their clinician. They can also decide to share information if they feel it will benefit them or will contribute more broadly to furthering knowledge about their conditions.
 In addition, we have begun partnering with biopharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, BioMarin, MyoKardia, Parion and others to support clinical trial recruitment and other research-related initiatives. 
 Competition
 Our competitors include companies that offer molecular genetic testing services, including specialty and reference laboratories that offer traditional single and multi‑gene tests. Principal competitors include companies such as Ambry Genetics, Inc.; Athena Diagnostics; Baylor Genetics; Blueprint Genetics, Inc.; Centogene AC; Color Genomics, Inc.; Connective Tissue Gene Test LLC; Counsyl, Inc.; Courtagen Life Sciences, Inc.; Eurofins Scientific; GeneDx, a subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc.; MNG Laboratories, LLC; Myriad Genetics, Inc.; Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings; PreventionGenetics, LLC; and Quest Diagnostics Incorporated as well as other commercial and academic labs. In addition to the companies that currently offer traditional genetic testing services and research centers, other established and emerging healthcare, information technology and service companies may commercialize competitive products including informatics, analysis, integrated genetic tools and services for health and wellness.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are:
  
• | breadth and depth of content;
--+------------------------------


• | quality;
--+---------


• | accessibility of results;
--+--------------------------


• | turnaround time of testing results;
--+------------------------------------


• | price and quality of tests;
--+----------------------------


• | coverage and reimbursement arrangements with third‑party payers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | convenience of testing;
--+------------------------


• | brand recognition of test provider;
--+------------------------------------


• | additional value‑added services and informatics tools;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | client service; and
--+--------------------


• | utility of website content.
--+----------------------------

 We believe that we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and market penetration, substantially greater financial, technological and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities, and more experience dealing with third‑party payers. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their tests than we do, or sell their tests at prices designed to win significant levels of market share. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations.
 Regulation
 Reimbursement
 In September 2014, the American Medical Association, or AMA, published new Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT codes for genomic sequencing procedures that are effective for dates of service on or after 
 5

January 1, 2015. These include genomic sequencing procedure codes for panels, including hereditary colon cancer syndromes, targeted genomic sequence analysis panels for solid organ neoplasms, targeted genomic sequence analysis panels for hematolymphoid neoplasm or disorders, whole exome analyses, and whole genome analyses. In a final determination under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, published in November 2014, CMS set the 2015 payment rate for these codes by the gap‑fill process. Under the gap‑fill process, local Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, establish rates for those codes that each MAC believes meet the criteria for Medicare coverage and considering laboratory charges and discounts to charges, resources, amounts paid by other payers for the tests, and amounts paid by the MAC for similar tests. In 2015, gapfilled payment rates were established for some, but not all, of the above‑referenced codes. For those codes for which local gap‑filled rates were established in 2015, a national limitation amount for Medicare was established for 2016. Codes for which local gap‑filled rates were not established in 2015 were priced by the local MACs in 2016 insofar as an individual MAC determined that such codes should be covered. Where available, the national limitation amount serves as a cap on the Medicare and Medicaid payment rates for a test procedure. If we are required to report our tests under these codes, there can be no guarantees that Medicare (or its contractors) has or will set adequate reimbursement rates for these codes.
 The AMA also released several CPT codes effective January 2016 that may be appropriate to report certain of our tests.  In a November 2015 final determination, CMS set the calendar year 2016 CLFS payment rate for these new codes by the gap-fill process.  CMS and the local MACs went through the gap-fill process in 2016 and announced final gap-filled rates for 2017 on September 30, 2016. The calendar year 2017 national limitation amounts for certain codes are significantly less than the rates at which we have historically offered our tests.
 In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Under the regulations implementing PAMA, laboratories that realize at least $12,500 in Medicare CLFS revenues during the six month reporting period and that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule must report, beginning in 2017, and then every three years thereafter (or annually for “advanced diagnostic laboratory tests”), private payer payment rates and volumes for their tests. We do not believe that our tests meet the current definition of advanced diagnostic laboratory tests, and therefore believe we are required to report private payer rates for our tests on an every three years basis. CMS will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for the tests equal to the volume‑weighted median of the private payer payment rates for the tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil money penalties. 
 As set forth under the regulations implementing PAMA, for tests furnished on or after January 1, 2018, Medicare payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests will be paid based upon these reported private payer rates. For clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that are assigned a new or substantially revised code, initial payment rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that are not advanced diagnostic laboratory tests will be assigned by the cross‑walk or gap‑fill methodology, as under prior law. Initial payment rates for new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests will be based on the actual list charge for the laboratory test.
 The payment rates calculated under PAMA are set to be effective starting January 1, 2018. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2018 through 2020 and to 15% per test per year in each of 2021 through 2023.
 PAMA codified Medicare coverage rules for laboratory tests by requiring any local coverage determination to be made following the local coverage determination process. PAMA also authorizes CMS to consolidate coverage policies for clinical laboratory tests among one to four laboratory‑specific MACs. These same contractors may also be designated to process claims if CMS determines that such a model is appropriate. It is unclear whether CMS will proceed with contractor consolidation under this authorization.
 PAMA also authorized the adoption of new, temporary billing codes and/or unique test identifiers for FDA‑cleared or approved tests as well as advanced diagnostic laboratory tests. The American Medical Association  has created a new section of billing codes, Proprietary Laboratory Analyses, to facilitate implementation of this section of PAMA. At this time, it is unclear how these codes would apply to our tests.

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA
 Our clinical reference laboratory in California is required to hold certain federal certificates to conduct our business. Under CLIA, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations we perform and to comply with standards covering personnel, facilities administration, inspections, quality control, quality assurance and proficiency testing.
 We have current certification under CLIA to perform testing at our laboratory location in San Francisco. To renew our CLIA certification, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical reference laboratory in California. The regulatory and compliance standards applicable to the testing we perform may change over time, and any such changes could have a material effect on our business.
 If our clinical reference laboratory is out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, as well as directed plan of correction, state on‑site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification to be eligible to bill for diagnostic services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA requirements and subjected to sanction, our business could be harmed.
 State laboratory licensure
 We are required to maintain a license to conduct testing in California. California laws establish standards for day‑to‑day operations of our laboratory in San Francisco. California laws mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory. If our clinical reference laboratory is out of compliance with California standards, the California Department of Health Services, or DHS, may suspend, restrict or revoke our license to operate our clinical reference laboratory, assess substantial civil money penalties, or impose specific corrective action plans. Any such actions could materially affect our business. We maintain a current license in good standing with DHS. However, we cannot provide assurance that DHS will at all times in the future find us to be in compliance with all such laws.
 Several states require the licensure of out‑of‑state laboratories that accept specimens from those states and/or receive specimens from laboratories in those states. Our laboratory holds the required out‑of‑state laboratory licenses for Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
 In addition to having a laboratory license in New York, our clinical reference laboratory in California is also required to obtain approval on a test‑specific basis by the New York State Department of Health, or NYDOH, before specific testing is performed on samples from New York. We are licensed by the state of New York to perform tests for over 600 genes, including tests for cardiology, dermatology, hematology, hereditary cancer, immunology, metabolic disorders and newborn screening, neurology, ophthalmology, and pediatric genetics.
 Other states may adopt similar licensure requirements in the future, which may require us to modify, delay or stop our operations in such jurisdictions. Complying with licensure requirements in new jurisdictions may be expensive, time‑consuming, and subject us to significant and unanticipated delays. If we identify any other state with such requirements, or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to follow instructions from the state regulators as to how we should comply with such requirements.
 We may also be subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions as we seek to expand international utilization of our tests or such jurisdictions adopt new licensure requirements, which may require review of our tests in order to offer them or may have other limitations such as restrictions on the transport of human blood necessary for us to perform our tests that may limit our ability to make our tests available outside of the United States.
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA
 We provide our tests as laboratory‑developed tests, or LDTs. CMS and certain state agencies regulate the performance of LDTs (as authorized by CLIA and state law, respectively).
 Historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion with respect to most LDTs and has not required laboratories that furnish LDTs to comply with the agency’s requirements for medical devices (e.g., establishment 
 7

registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post‑ market controls). In recent years, however, the FDA has stated it intends to end its policy of general enforcement discretion and regulate certain LDTs as medical devices. To this end, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents, entitled “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)” and “FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)”, respectively, that set forth a proposed risk‑based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs. The FDA has indicated that it does not intend to modify its policy of enforcement discretion until the draft guidance documents are finalized.  Subsequently, on January 13, 2017, the FDA published a “discussion paper” in which the agency outlined a substantially revised “possible approach” to the oversight of LDTs.  The discussion paper explicitly states that it is not a final version of the 2014 draft guidance and that it does not represent the agency’s “formal position”; rather, the discussion paper represents the latest iteration of the agency’s thinking on LDTs, which the agency posted to “spur further dialogue”.  Notably, in the discussion paper, the agency expressed its willingness to consider “grandfathering” currently marketed LDTs from most or all FDA regulatory requirements.  It is unclear at this time when, or if, the FDA will finalize its plans to end enforcement discretion, and even then, the new regulatory requirements are expected to be phased‑in over time. Nevertheless, the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case‑by‑case basis at any time.
 Legislative proposals addressing the FDA’s oversight of LDTs have been introduced in previous Congresses, and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time‑to‑time. The likelihood that Congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the FDA’s plans to regulate certain LDTs as medical devices is difficult to predict at this time.
 If the FDA ultimately regulates certain LDTs as medical devices, whether via final guidance, final regulation, or as instructed by Congress, our tests may be subject to certain additional regulatory requirements. Complying with the FDA’s requirements for medical devices can be expensive, time‑consuming, and subject us to significant or unanticipated delays. Insofar as we may be required to obtain premarket clearance or approval to perform or continue performing an LDT, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such authorization. Even if we obtain regulatory clearance or approval where required, such authorization may not be for the intended uses that we believe are commercially attractive or are critical to the commercial success of our tests. As a result, the application of the FDA’s medical device requirements to our tests could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may trigger a range of enforcement actions by the FDA including warning letters, civil monetary penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations, and denial of or challenges to applications for clearance or approval, as well as significant adverse publicity.
 In addition, in November 2013, the FDA issued final guidance regarding the distribution of products labeled for research use only. Certain of the reagents and other products we use in our tests are labeled as research use only products. Certain of our suppliers may cease selling research use only products to us and any failure to obtain an acceptable substitute could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 HIPAA and HITECH
 Under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by most healthcare providers and other covered entities and their respective business associates, including the business associates’ subcontractors. Four principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA and HITECH: privacy regulations, security regulations, the breach notification rule, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions.
 The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities as well as business associates, which are defined to include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information on behalf of a business associate. A subcontractor means any person to whom a business associate delegates a function, activity, or service, other than in the capacity of the business associate’s workforce. As a general rule, a covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose protected health 
 8

information except as permitted under the privacy regulations. The privacy regulations also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a covered entity or business associate, including the right to access or amend certain records containing his or her protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of his or her protected health information.
 Covered entities and business associates also must comply with the security regulations, which establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. In addition, HITECH established, among other things, certain breach notification requirements with which covered entities and business associates must comply. In particular, a covered entity must notify any individual whose unsecured protected health information is breached according to the specifications set forth in the breach notification rule. A covered entity must also notify the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and, under certain circumstances, the media.
 The HIPAA privacy, security, and breach notification regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than protected health information as defined under HIPAA. Massachusetts, for example, has a state law that protects the privacy and security of personal information of Massachusetts residents.
 There are significant civil and criminal fines and other penalties that may be imposed for violating HIPAA. A covered entity or business associate is also liable for civil money penalties for a violation that is based on an act or omission of any of its agents, including a downstream business associate, as determined according to the federal common law of agency. Additionally, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and HITECH, payments to us may be delayed or denied.
 Federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws
 In the United States, there are various fraud and abuse laws with which we must comply, and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws.
 In the United States, the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in order to induce or in return for the referral of an individual for the furnishing of or arranging for the furnishing of, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti‑Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co‑payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although the Anti‑Kickback Statute contains several exceptions, it is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry. Further, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with the statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute will be pursued. Penalties for federal anti‑kickback violations are severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states also have anti‑kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payer, including commercial insurers.
 9

There are also federal laws related to healthcare fraud and false statements, among others, relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from governmental payer programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from governmental payer programs.
 Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal governmental payer program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government by submitting a false claim to the federal government and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $10,781 to $21,563 for each false claim.
 In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, and some of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payer and not only a governmental payer program.
 Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or for a claim that is false or fraudulent. This law also prohibits the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier for items or services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies.
 In Europe various countries have adopted anti‑bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti‑bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010, faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
 Physician referral prohibitions
 A federal law directed at “self‑referrals,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from making referrals of Medicare patients for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, to an entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has a direct or indirect financial relationship, unless an exception applies. The prohibition also extends to payment for any services referred in violation of the Stark Law. A physician or entity that engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare program in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per service, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Bills submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited bill is obligated to refund such amounts. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare referrals. The Stark Law also prohibits state receipt of Federal Medicaid matching funds for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral, but this 
 10

provision of the Stark Law has not been implemented by regulations. In addition, some courts have held that the submission of claims to Medicaid that would be prohibited as self‑referrals under the Stark Law for Medicare could implicate the False Claims Act.
 Corporate practice of medicine
 Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging clinicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision‑making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining what diagnostic tests are appropriate for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of the patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us and/or the professional through licensure proceedings. Typically, such laws are only enforced against entities that have a physical presence in the state.
 Intellectual property
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, customary contractual protections and, to a lesser extent, patents, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. With respect to patents, we believe that the practice of patenting individual genes, along with patenting tools and methods specific to individual genes, has impeded the progress of the genetic testing industry beyond single gene tests and is antithetical to our core principle that patients should own and control their own genomic information. In recent years the U.S. Supreme Court has issued a series of unanimous (9‑0) decisions setting forth limits on the patentability of natural phenomena, natural laws, abstract ideas and their applications—i.e., Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories (2012), or Mayo, Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (2013), or Myriad, and Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank (2014), or Alice. As discussed below, we believe the Mayo, Myriad and Alice decisions bring clarity to the limits to which patents may cover specific genes, mutations of such genes, or gene‑specific technology for determining a patient’s genomic information.
 Patents
 Recent U.S. Supreme Court cases have clarified that naturally occurring DNA sequences are natural phenomena, which should not be patentable. On June 13, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Myriad, a case challenging the validity of patent claims held by Myriad relating to the cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. The Myriad Court held that genomic DNAs that have been isolated from, or have the same sequence as, naturally occurring samples, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes or fragments thereof, are not eligible for patent protection. Instead, the Myriad Court held that only those complementary DNAs (cDNAs) which have a sequence that differs from a naturally occurring fragment of genomic DNA may be patent eligible. Because it will be applied by other courts to all gene patents, the holding in Myriad also invalidates patent claims to other genes and gene variants. Prior to Myriad, on August 16, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had held that certain patent claims of Myriad directed to methods of comparing or analyzing BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences to determine whether or not a person has a variant or mutation are unpatentable abstract processes, and Myriad did not appeal such ruling.
 We do not currently have any patents or patent applications directed to the sequences of specific genes or variants of such genes, nor have we in‑licensed such patents rights of any third party. We believe that correlations between specific gene variants and a person’s susceptibility to certain conditions or diseases are natural laws that are not patentable under the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Mayo. The Mayo case involved patent claims directed to optimizing, on a patient‑specific basis, the dosage of a certain drug by measuring its metabolites in a patient. The Mayo Court determined that patent claims directed at detection of natural correlations, such as the correlation between drug metabolite levels in a patient and that drug’s optimal dosage for such patient, are not eligible for patent protection. The Mayo Court held that claims based on this type of comparison between an observed fact and an understanding of that fact’s implications represent attempts to patent a natural law and, moreover, when the processes for making the comparison are not themselves sufficiently inventive, claims to such processes are similarly patent‑ineligible. On June 19, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Alice, where it amplified its Mayo
11

and Myriad decisions and clarified the analytical framework for distinguishing between patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena and abstract ideas and those that claim patent‑eligible applications of such concepts. According to the Alice Court, the analysis depends on whether a patent claim directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon or an abstract idea contains additional elements, an “inventive concept,” that “is ‘sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself;” (citing Mayo).
 We believe that Mayo, Myriad and Alice not only render as unpatentable genes, gene fragments and the detection of a person’s sequence for a gene, but also have the same effect on generic applications of conventional technology to specific gene sequences. For example, we believe that generic claims to primers or probes directed to specific gene sequences and uses of such primers and probes in determining a person’s genetic information are not patentable. We do not currently have any patents or patent applications directed to such subject matter nor have we in‑licensed such patents rights of any third party.
 Unlike patents directed to specific genes, we do rely upon, in part, patent protection to protect technology that is not gene‑specific and that provides us with a potential competitive advantage as we focus on making comprehensive genetic information less expensive and more broadly available to our clients. In this regard, we have one issued U.S. patent, three pending U.S. utility patent applications, three pending PCT applications, two pending U.S. provisional patent applications and nine pending non‑U.S. applications directed to various aspects of our laboratory, analytic and business practices. We intend to pursue further patent protection where appropriate.
 Trade secrets
 In addition to seeking patent protection for some of our laboratory, analytic and business practices, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know‑how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain and develop our competitive position. We have developed proprietary procedures for both the laboratory processing of patient samples and the analysis of the resulting data to generate clinical reports. For example, we have automated aspects of our processes for curating information about known variants, identifying variants in an individual’s sequence information, associating those variants with known information about their potential effects on disease, and presenting that information for review by personnel responsible for its interpretation and for the delivery of test reports to clinicians. We try to protect these trade secrets, in part, by taking reasonable steps to keep them confidential. This includes entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees and certain third parties. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. However, we may not enter into such agreements with all relevant parties, and these parties may not abide by the terms of their agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy or independently develop and commercially exploit aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
 Trademarks
 We work hard to achieve a high level of quality in our operations and to provide our clients with a superior experience when interacting with us. As a consequence, our brand is very important to us, as it is a symbol of our reputation and representative of the goodwill we seek to generate with our clients. As a consequence, we have invested significant resources in protection of our trademarks. To date, we have filed for trademark protection for INVITAE as well as our logo (circle design) and INVITAE with the logo. Registrations for INVITAE have been obtained in 30 countries and are currently pending in more than two countries. Applications for our logo (circle design) have been obtained in 28 countries and are currently pending in more than three countries, and one application is pending for INVITAE with the logo.
 Environmental matters
 Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) that subject us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or 
 12

individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business, operations or the cost of compliance.
 Raw materials and suppliers
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers, or, in some cases, sole suppliers, including Agilent Technologies, Inc., Illumina, Inc., Integrated DNA Technologies Incorporated, Qiagen N.V. and Roche Holdings Ltd. for certain laboratory reagents, as well as sequencers and other equipment and materials which we use in our laboratory operations. We rely on Illumina as the sole supplier of next generation sequencers and associated reagents and as the sole provider of maintenance and repair services for these sequencers. Our laboratory operations could be interrupted if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these reagents, sequencers or other equipment or materials, and if we cannot obtain an acceptable substitute. Any such interruption could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. We believe that there are only a few other manufacturers that are currently capable of supplying and servicing the equipment necessary for our laboratory operations, including sequencers and various associated reagents. The use of equipment or materials provided by these replacement suppliers would require us to alter our laboratory operations. Transitioning to a new supplier would be time consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our laboratory operations, could affect the performance specifications of our laboratory operations or could require that we revalidate our tests. We cannot assure you that we would be able to secure alternative equipment, reagents and other materials, or bring such equipment, reagents and materials on line and revalidate them without experiencing interruptions in our workflow. If we encounter delays or difficulties in securing, reconfiguring or revalidating the equipment and reagents we require for our tests, our business and reputation could be adversely affected.
